We explored the effects of soy oligopeptides (SOP) in ultraviolet B- (UVB-) induced acute photodamage of human skin in vivo and foreskin ex vivo. Methods. We irradiated the forearm with 1.5 minimal erythemal dose (MED) of UVB for 3 consecutive days, establishing acute photodamage of skin, and topically applied SOP. Erythema index (EI), melanin index, stratum corneum hydration, and transepidermal water loss were measured by using Multiprobe Adapter 9 device. We irradiated foreskin ex vivo with the same dose of UVB (180 mJ/cm2) for 3 consecutive days and topically applied SOP. Sunburn cells were detected by using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Apoptotic cells were detected by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), p53 protein, Bax protein, and Bcl-2 protein were detected by using immunohistochemical staining. Results. Compared with UVB group, UVB-irradiated skin with topically applied SOP showed significantly decreased EI. Compared with UVB group, topical SOP significantly increased Bcl-2 protein expression and decreased CPDs-positive cells, sunburn cells, apoptotic cells, p53 protein expression, and Bax protein expressions in the epidermis of UVB-irradiated foreskin. Conclusion. Our study demonstrated that topical SOP can protect human skin against UVB-induced photodamage.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this way, we demonstrate that while short-term cell survival is upregulated after an initial 1 week period of enrichment in 2 month old female mice, after long-term enrichment (2 months) neither cell proliferation nor the survival of the younger newly born cell populations are distinguishable from that observed in non-enriched control mice. In addition, we show that the survival of older newborn neurons alone (i.e. those born at the beginning of the enrichment) is higher than in controls, due to the significantly lower levels of cell death. Indeed, these parameters are rapidly adjusted to the sudden cessation of the EE conditions. These findings suggest both an early selective, long-lasting effect of EE on the neurons born in the initial stages of enrichment, and a quick response when the environment again becomes impoverished. Therefore, EE induces differential effects on distinct subpopulations of newborn neurons depending on the age of the immature cells and on the duration of the EE itself.

Additionally, in the obese women and in the controls, plasma ANP was measured after iv injection of clonidine. Anorectic patients were investigated in the period of weight loss (mean deficit of body weight was 40%). The mean body mass index (BMI) in the obese women was 36.44 +/- 0.36 kg/m2. Basal plasma ANP concentrations were significantly higher in both anorectic and obese women (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The response of ANP to acute water load was markedly blunted in anorexia nervosa and in obesity (delta % = 232% in control group, 14% in anorexia nervosa and 21% in obesity. A significant increase of ANP was found after iv injection of clonidine in the control group and in obesity (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). However, the increase of response (expressed as a percentage change) in obese patients was lower than that in the control group (delta % = 64% and 199%, respectively). The response of ANP to alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation was higher than to hemodynamic stimulus.

Following Illumina 450K, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis reveals that stilbenoids alter DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer cells. On average, 75% of differentially methylated genes have increased methylation, and these genes are enriched for oncogenic functions, including NOTCH signaling pathway.

The increased DNA methylation at MAML2 enhancer coincides with increased occupancy of repressive histone marks and decrease in activating marks.

Background Epicardial catheter ablation for ventricular arrhythmias (VA) is an important therapeutic option in patients after endocardial ablation failure. However, epicardial mapping and ablation are limited by the presence of coronary arteries and epicardial fat. Methods Twenty-eight patients (21 male, age 59 ± 16 years) underwent combined endo-epicardial electroanatomical mapping. Prior to the procedure, MDCT derived coronary anatomy and epicardial fat meshes were loaded into the mapping system (CARTO XP, Biosense Webster Inc, Diamond Bar, California). Real-time registration of MDCT data was performed after endocardial mapping. The distance between epicardial ablation sites and coronary arteries was assessed by registered MDCT and angiography. After the procedure, mapping and ablation points were superimposed on the MDCT using a reversed registration matrix for head-to-head comparison of mapping data and corresponding fat thickness. Results Image registration was successful and accurate in all patients (position error 2.8 ± 1.3 mm). At sites without evidence for scar, epicardial bipolar voltage decreased significantly (p Conclusions Real-time image integration of pre-acquired MDCT information is feasible and accurate. Epicardial fat >7 mm and the presence of coronary arteries are important reasons for epicardial ablation failure.

Background Epicardial catheter ablation for ventricular arrhythmias (VA) is an important therapeutic option in patients after endocardial ablation failure. However, epicardial mapping and ablation are limited by the presence of coronary arteries and epicardial fat. Methods Twenty-eight patients (21 male, age 59 ± 16 years) underwent combined endo-epicardial electroanatomical mapping. Prior to the procedure, MDCT derived coronary anatomy and epicardial fat meshes were loaded into the mapping system (CARTO XP, Biosense Webster Inc, Diamond Bar, California). Real-time registration of MDCT data was performed after endocardial mapping. The distance between epicardial ablation sites and coronary arteries was assessed by registered MDCT and angiography. After the procedure, mapping and ablation points were superimposed on the MDCT using a reversed registration matrix for head-to-head comparison of mapping data and corresponding fat thickness. Results Image registration was successful and accurate in all patients (position error 2.8 ± 1.3 mm). At sites without evidence for scar, epicardial bipolar voltage decreased significantly (p Conclusions Real-time image integration of pre-acquired MDCT information is feasible and accurate. Epicardial fat >7 mm and the presence of coronary arteries are important reasons for epicardial ablation failure. Visualization of fat thickness during the procedure may facilitate interpretation of bipolar electrograms and identification of ineffective ablation sites.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Based on their data, the authors suggest that the assessment of lymphatic vessel density (LVD) might give prognostic information in cutaneous melanoma. As they point out, some conclusions of their study might, in part, be in discordance with our own report (Straume et al, 2003), and we would therefore like to discuss some aspects of their work. ::: ::: So far, relatively few survival studies on lymphangiogenesis have been published. In 2001, Birner et al (2001) presented a study on cervical cancer, and later our group published the first survival study of melanomas, based on 175 cases of aggressive vertical growth phase melanoma of the nodular type (median thickness 3.6 mm) (Straume et al, 2003). The results of both these studies indicate that increased LVD is associated with improved patient survival. More recently, however, Valencak et al (2004) published a prognostic study of 120 melanoma patients showing a weak association between increased LVD and reduced survival, although in univariate analysis only. In a study by Dadras et al (2003), based on the selection of 19 nonmetastatic melanoma patients and 18 patients with early lymph node metastasis, intratumour LVD was found to be increased in the metastatic group. In the study of Shields et al, including 21 melanoma cases (eight nonmetastatic, mean thickness 2.3 mm, and 11 metastatic, mean thickness 3.4 mm), LVD was also higher in tumours that developed metastases. Interestingly, LVD tended to decrease with increasing tumour thickness (their Table 2). No follow-up information (time to events) was presented. Whereas these three studies (Dadras et al, 2003; Shields et al, 2004; Valencak et al, 2004) seem to imply that increased LVD is associated with tumour progression and poor prognosis, the contrary was found in our own study (Straume et al, 2003). What could explain this difference? ::: ::: Several explanations might be considered. We agree with Shields et al that the ‘hot spot’ technique, originally described by Weidner et al (1991) for the estimation of angiogenesis, might be more applicable for blood microvascular capillaries, and this approach is more subjective. The authors discuss whether some of the differences in our results could be attributed to this fact. Although our two studies showed comparable values of mean epi/peri-tumoral LVD (10.0 vs 14.3 mm−2), we wanted to address this issue and selected 19 lethal and 21 nonlethal melanoma cases from our series (Straume et al, 2003), and tumours were matched for thickness. Lymphatic vessels were counted along the complete tumour border in consecutive high power fields (HPF, × 400), and vessels more than 1 HPF away from the invasive border were not counted. We found that the median absolute LVD (LVD-ABS) was 5.4 vessels mm−2 compared with 12.5 mm−2 by the ‘hot spot’ technique (LVD-HS) (7.0 in nonlethal cases, 3.4 in lethal cases), and LVD-ABS and LVD-HS were highly correlated (linear regression R=0.74, P<0.001 for continuous variables, and Pearson χ2 R=0.7, P<0.001 when categorised between lymphatic vessel rich or poor cases). Most importantly, the analysis of both overall survival (melanoma deaths only) and recurrence-free survival showed the same association for both LVD-ABS and LVD-HS, that is, improved survival by increased LVD-ABS (log rank P=0.005, n=40) and increased LVD-HS (log rank P<0.0001, n=169). These data indicate that the difference in results cannot be explained by the difference in counting technique only. Still, we agree that LVD-ABS might be more appropriate and more easily standardised than LVD-HS, as suggested by Shields. ::: ::: In the study by Dadras et al (2003), 18 metastatic and 19 nonmetastatic melanomas were included (mean thickness 2.5 mm, 68% Clark 4–5; mainly (76%) superficial spreading melanomas). The median peritumoral LVD (12.8 mm−2) was almost identical with our own findings (12.5 mm−2), suggesting that both methods (Dadras: computer-assisted morphometric analysis; Straume: counting in ‘hot spot’ areas a.m. Weidner) gave similar results. Even if low reproducibility is considered an important problem of vessel counting (Hlatky et al, 2002), this method is frequently used in translational angiogenesis research; other methods, including morphometry, have not proved to be superior. ::: ::: The study of Valencak et al (2004) included 120 cases of cutaneous melanoma with follow-up information (median thickness not given; 18% of patients were Clark 0–2, 45% were Clark 4–5; in comparison, 90% were Clark 4–5 in our own study). By staining for podoplanin, and using the ‘hot spot’ method of counting, the mean LVD was 11.3 per field (field size not given), and this is probably considerably higher than in the other studies. Increased LVD was associated with decreased survival, but the difference was only modest and did not persist in multivariate analysis, in contrast to what we found (Straume et al, 2003). The use of different markers could be one explanation for the findings, although LVD by LYVE-1 and podoplanin staining was significantly correlated in our previous study. Also, the sensitivity and specificity of the LYVE-1 antibody were evaluated in a recent study by Akishima et al (2004). ::: ::: It should be pointed out that our series (Straume et al, 2003) consisted of thicker and more advanced primary melanomas than the other series, consisting of vertical growth phase melanomas only. This could be an important explanation why the relationship between LVD and progression/prognosis appears to be different. Interestingly, we found a significant association between increased LVD and lymphocytic infiltration, which is a favourable prognostic factor for cutaneous melanomas, and a similar relationship with lymphatic vascular area was found by Dadras et al (2003). This points to a relationship between lymphatic vessels and an antitumour immune response. ::: ::: The studies of Dadras et al and Shields et al have included a low number of pre-selected cases and might not be classified as prognostic factor studies according to the criteria of Simon and Altman (1994). For instance, Dadras et al did not present prognostic information on LVD, but found that relative lymphatic vessel area was a prognostic factor, although their cut-points appear to be selected on the basis of a relationship with a strong predictor of outcome, that is, lymph node metastases (their Figure 6A). The ‘prognostic’ information from these studies should therefore be interpreted with great care. A summary of studies of clinical end points according to lymphatic markers in human cancers has recently been given by Padera et al (2003). ::: ::: The results of animal studies have suggested that increased lymphangiogenesis may be important for the frequency of lymphatic metastasis, and the recent identification of novel lymphangiogenic factors, like VEGF-C and VEGF-D, has increased the focus on lymphangiogenesis considerably (Kaipainen et al, 1995; Achen et al, 1998; Skobe et al, 2001; Stacker et al, 2001). Still, the evidence provided in the literature is not sufficient to conclude that active lymphangiogenesis play an important role in human cancer. As for the difference between studies on cutaneous melanoma, the balance between LVD as a marker of lymphatic spread, and its association with lymphocytic infiltration and antitumour immune activity, might differ between early (thinner) and late stage (thicker) melanomas. Also, the relative contribution of lymphogenic and hematogenic metastases may be different between these tumour subgroups. We feel that more survival studies, following the criteria of Simon and Altman (1994), are needed before the estimation of lymphangiogenesis is applicable to clinical decision making and prognostication in melanoma patients.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Based on their data, the authors suggest that the assessment of lymphatic vessel density (LVD) might give prognostic information in cutaneous melanoma. As they point out, some conclusions of their study might, in part, be in discordance with our own report (Straume et al, 2003), and we would therefore like to discuss some aspects of their work. ::: ::: So far, relatively few survival studies on lymphangiogenesis have been published. In 2001, Birner et al (2001) presented a study on cervical cancer, and later our group published the first survival study of melanomas, based on 175 cases of aggressive vertical growth phase melanoma of the nodular type (median thickness 3.6 mm) (Straume et al, 2003). The results of both these studies indicate that increased LVD is associated with improved patient survival. More recently, however, Valencak et al (2004) published a prognostic study of 120 melanoma patients showing a weak association between increased LVD and reduced survival, although in univariate analysis only. In a study by Dadras et al (2003), based on the selection of 19 nonmetastatic melanoma patients and 18 patients with early lymph node metastasis, intratumour LVD was found to be increased in the metastatic group. In the study of Shields et al, including 21 melanoma cases (eight nonmetastatic, mean thickness 2.3 mm, and 11 metastatic, mean thickness 3.4 mm), LVD was also higher in tumours that developed metastases. Interestingly, LVD tended to decrease with increasing tumour thickness (their Table 2). No follow-up information (time to events) was presented. Whereas these three studies (Dadras et al, 2003; Shields et al, 2004; Valencak et al, 2004) seem to imply that increased LVD is associated with tumour progression and poor prognosis, the contrary was found in our own study (Straume et al, 2003). What could explain this difference? ::: ::: Several explanations might be considered. We agree with Shields et al that the ‘hot spot’ technique, originally described by Weidner et al (1991) for the estimation of angiogenesis, might be more applicable for blood microvascular capillaries, and this approach is more subjective. The authors discuss whether some of the differences in our results could be attributed to this fact. Although our two studies showed comparable values of mean epi/peri-tumoral LVD (10.0 vs 14.3 mm−2), we wanted to address this issue and selected 19 lethal and 21 nonlethal melanoma cases from our series (Straume et al, 2003), and tumours were matched for thickness. Lymphatic vessels were counted along the complete tumour border in consecutive high power fields (HPF, × 400), and vessels more than 1 HPF away from the invasive border were not counted. We found that the median absolute LVD (LVD-ABS) was 5.4 vessels mm−2 compared with 12.5 mm−2 by the ‘hot spot’ technique (LVD-HS) (7.0 in nonlethal cases, 3.4 in lethal cases), and LVD-ABS and LVD-HS were highly correlated (linear regression R=0.74, P<0.001 for continuous variables, and Pearson χ2 R=0.7, P<0.001 when categorised between lymphatic vessel rich or poor cases). Most importantly, the analysis of both overall survival (melanoma deaths only) and recurrence-free survival showed the same association for both LVD-ABS and LVD-HS, that is, improved survival by increased LVD-ABS (log rank P=0.005, n=40) and increased LVD-HS (log rank P<0.0001, n=169). These data indicate that the difference in results cannot be explained by the difference in counting technique only. Still, we agree that LVD-ABS might be more appropriate and more easily standardised than LVD-HS, as suggested by Shields. ::: ::: In the study by Dadras et al (2003), 18 metastatic and 19 nonmetastatic melanomas were included (mean thickness 2.5 mm, 68% Clark 4–5; mainly (76%) superficial spreading melanomas). The median peritumoral LVD (12.8 mm−2) was almost identical with our own findings (12.5 mm−2), suggesting that both methods (Dadras: computer-assisted morphometric analysis; Straume: counting in ‘hot spot’ areas a.m. Weidner) gave similar results. Even if low reproducibility is considered an important problem of vessel counting (Hlatky et al, 2002), this method is frequently used in translational angiogenesis research; other methods, including morphometry, have not proved to be superior. ::: ::: The study of Valencak et al (2004) included 120 cases of cutaneous melanoma with follow-up information (median thickness not given; 18% of patients were Clark 0–2, 45% were Clark 4–5; in comparison, 90% were Clark 4–5 in our own study). By staining for podoplanin, and using the ‘hot spot’ method of counting, the mean LVD was 11.3 per field (field size not given), and this is probably considerably higher than in the other studies. Increased LVD was associated with decreased survival, but the difference was only modest and did not persist in multivariate analysis, in contrast to what we found (Straume et al, 2003). The use of different markers could be one explanation for the findings, although LVD by LYVE-1 and podoplanin staining was significantly correlated in our previous study. Also, the sensitivity and specificity of the LYVE-1 antibody were evaluated in a recent study by Akishima et al (2004). ::: ::: It should be pointed out that our series (Straume et al, 2003) consisted of thicker and more advanced primary melanomas than the other series, consisting of vertical growth phase melanomas only.

Despite the potential for substantial improvement in function with acute rehabilitation, the factors affecting its cost have not yet been evaluated. We used a proprietary hospital database to evaluate the direct costs of rehabilitation after spine injury. Methods A single-center, retrospective cohort cost analysis of patients with acute, traumatic spine injury treated at a tertiary facility from 2011 to 2017 was performed. Results In the 190 patients (mean age 46.1 ± 18.6 years, 76.3% males) identified, American Spinal Injury Association impairment scores on admission were 32.1% A, 14.7% B, 14.7% C, 33.2% D, and 1.1% E. Surgical treatment was performed in 179 (94.2%) cases. Most injuries were in the cervical spine (53.2%). A mean improvement of Functional Impairment Score of 30.7 ± 16.2 was seen after acute rehabilitation. Costs for care comprised facility (86.5%), pharmacy (9.2%), supplies (2.0%), laboratory (1.5%), and imaging (0.8%) categories. Injury level, injury severity, and prior inpatient surgical treatment did not affect the cost of rehabilitation. Higher injury severity (p = 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) and spinal level of injury (p = 0.001, one-way ANOVA) were associated with higher length of rehabilitation stay in univariate analysis. However, length of rehabilitation stay was the strongest independent predictor of higher-than-median cost (risk ratio = 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.0, p = 0.001) after adjusting for other factors. Conclusions Spine injury has a high upfront cost of care, with greater need for rehabilitation substantially affecting cost. Improving the efficacy of rehabilitation to reduce length of stay may be effective in reducing cost.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is induced by a large IB leakage current due to hot carrier which introduces generation/recombination center traps and leads to excess non-ideal base current.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To optimize GH and estrogen treatment, we studied 68 previously untreated girls with TS, age 2-11 yr, who were randomly assigned to one of three GH dosage groups: group A, 4 IU/m2 day (approximately 0.045 mg/kg x day); group B, first yr 4, thereafter 6 IU/m2 x day (approximately 0.0675 mg/kg/day); group C, first yr 4, second yr 6, thereafter 8 IU/m2 x day (approximately 0.090 mg/kg x day). In the first 4 yr of GH treatment, no estrogens for pubertal induction were given to the girls. Thereafter, girls started with 17beta-estradiol (5 microg/kg bw x day, orally) when they had reached the age of 12 yr. Subjects were followed up until attainment of adult height or until cessation of treatment because of satisfaction with the height achieved. Seven-year data of all girls were evaluated to compare the growth-promoting effects of three GH dosages during childhood. After 7 yr, 85% of the girls had reached a height within the normal range for healthy Dutch girls. The 7-yr increment in height SD-score was significantly higher in groups B and C than in group A. In addition, we evaluated the data of 32 of the 68 girls who had completed the trial after a mean duration of treatment of 7.3 yr (range, 5.0 - 8.75). Mean (SD) height was 158.8 cm (7.1), 161.0 cm (6.8), and 162.3 cm (6.1) in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The mean (SD) difference between predicted adult height before treatment and achieved height was 12.5 cm (2.1), 14.5 cm (4.0), and 16.0 cm (4.1) for groups A, B, and C, respectively, being significantly different between group A and group C. GH treatment was well tolerated in all three GH dosage groups. In conclusion, GH treatment starting in relatively young girls with TS results in normalization of height during childhood, as well as of adult height, in most of the individuals. With this GH and estrogen treatment regimen, most girls with TS can grow and develop much more in conformity with their healthy peers.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this study we reviewed our anesthesia experience with ESC. The hypothesis was that infants with low body weight and syndromes would have a higher risk of perioperative blood transfusion and that those with respiratory complications are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patient charts and anesthesia records of the first 100 consecutive infants who underwent ESC between May 2004 and December 2008 and follow-up evaluations until December 2009. Outcomes included (a) perioperative blood transfusion, (b) venous air embolism (VAE), (c) ICU admission, and (d) reoperation with craniofacial reconstruction procedures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine significant factors of patient outcomes. RESULTS: Infants ranging from 4 to 34 weeks of age (weight: 3.2 to 10.1 kg), presented for 87 single and 13 multiple ESC. Four infants had a craniofacial syndrome. The mean surgical time was 48 minutes (range: 26 to 86 minutes). Ninety-two infants had a median estimated blood loss of 23 mL (interquartile ranges [IQR]: 15 to 30 mL). Eight infants who required blood transfusion received a median amount of 17.2 mL/kg (IQR: 10.1 to 21.2 mL/kg). Body weight ≤5 kg (P = 0.04), sagittal ESC (P < 0.01), syndromic craniosynostosis (P < 0.01), and earlier date of surgery in the series (P < 0.01) were factors associated with blood transfusion. VAE was detected in 2 infants with no changes in clinical outcome. Eight infants were admitted to the ICU. Factors associated with ICU admission were blood transfusion (P < 0.001) and respiratory complications (P < 0.001). Eighty-two infants were discharged on postoperative day 1 (range: 1 to 3 days). Six infants underwent subsequent fronto-orbital advancement and 1 cranial vault reconstruction. Multiple-suture craniosynostosis (P < 0.01), associated syndromes (P = 0.03), and ICU admission after ESC (P = 0.04) were predictive of reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty percent of infants undergoing ESC had 1 or more of the following: need for blood transfusion, VAE, respiratory complications, and ICU admission. Multivariable analysis confirmed that patients with lower body weight, those with earlier date of surgery in the series, those undergoing sagittal ESC, and those with syndromic craniosynostosis had a higher rate of blood transfusion.

Eligible patients were ≥18 years of age and experiencing pain that was being managed with an around-the-clock opioid yet were experiencing ≤4 BTCP episodes daily and were opioid-tolerant (i.e., receiving ≥60 mg/day oral morphine or an equivalent dose of another opioid for ≥1 week). De novo patients initially entered a 21-day titration period to identify an effective dose of fentanyl sublingual spray (100-1600 μg), then entered a 90-day maintenance period. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), results of laboratory tests, vital sign assessments, and treatment satisfaction were assessed. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Of the 269 patients (de novo, 179; rollover, 90) who entered the maintenance period, 163 (60.6 %) completed the study; the primary reason for discontinuation was an AE (22.3 %). Eighty percent of patients identified an effective dose of fentanyl sublingual spray (median dose, 600 μg). The most common AEs differed from the titration period (nausea (13 %), vomiting (12 %), and somnolence (10 %)) to the maintenance period (malignant neoplasm progression (24 %), vomiting (16 %), and peripheral edema (12 %)). Few changes in laboratory parameters and vital sign assessments were observed.

Mean preinduction cervical length was 26.8±9.9 mm in the vaginal delivery group and 34.2±8.1 mm in the cesarean section group (P < .05). Mean maternal age, parity, and Bishop score were significantly higher and mean weight of the newborn was significantly lower in the vaginal delivery group.

The way devices communicate is increasingly changing in complexity and while threats have evolved, techniques and technologies to counteract them have stagnated in comparison. One of the most persistent threats to signal transmission is signal jamming. The rapid development of technologies such as wireless communication which includes mobile phone signal transmission, Wi-Fi, critical infrastructure communications as well as IoT have attracted increased levels of signal jamming to disrupt, interfere and in some instances, block the transmission entirely. Signal jammers have come a long way in terms of both complexity as well as affordability. These jammer devices work by overwhelming the transmitting signal as way of ""shouting louder"" than legitimate signal and as a result, disrupt and block it. The importance of understanding this threat is more precarious when critical telecommunication infrastructure is considered: - GSM Communications (Disruption of phone communications) - Defense Ministry Communications (Disruption of sensitive communications) - Emergency Services Communications (Disruption of potentially mission-critical, health or security communications) Available research and literature tackled this problem with varying degrees of success. This project will look to highlight the existential threat to local infrastructure and develop an effective method to supressing and thereby, minimising the threat.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Private Sector Data"",""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

One of the most persistent threats to signal transmission is signal jamming. The rapid development of technologies such as wireless communication which includes mobile phone signal transmission, Wi-Fi, critical infrastructure communications as well as IoT have attracted increased levels of signal jamming to disrupt, interfere and in some instances, block the transmission entirely. Signal jammers have come a long way in terms of both complexity as well as affordability. These jammer devices work by overwhelming the transmitting signal as way of ""shouting louder"" than legitimate signal and as a result, disrupt and block it. The importance of understanding this threat is more precarious when critical telecommunication infrastructure is considered: - GSM Communications (Disruption of phone communications) - Defense Ministry Communications (Disruption of sensitive communications) - Emergency Services Communications (Disruption of potentially mission-critical, health or security communications) Available research and literature tackled this problem with varying degrees of success. This project will look to highlight the existential threat to local infrastructure and develop an effective method to supressing and thereby, minimising the threat.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, for biotechnological applications, plasmid-based expression systems are not suitable because of genetic instability, and the requirement for constant selective pressure to ensure plasmid maintenance. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To overcome these drawbacks, we constructed an Escherichia coli lycopene production strain that does not carry a plasmid or an antibiotic marker. This was achieved using triclosan-induced chromosomal evolution, a high gene copy expression system. The engineered strain demonstrated high genetic stability in the absence of the selective agent during fermentation. The replacement of native appY promoter with a T5 promoter, and the deletion of the iclR gene in E. coli CBW 12241 further improved lycopene production. The resulting strain, E. coli CBW 12241(ΔiclR, PT5-appY), produced lycopene at 33.43 mg per gram of dry cell weight. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: A lycopene hyper-producer E. coli strain that does not carry a plasmid or antibiotic marker was constructed using triclosan-induced chromosomal evolution.

However, for biotechnological applications, plasmid-based expression systems are not suitable because of genetic instability, and the requirement for constant selective pressure to ensure plasmid maintenance. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To overcome these drawbacks, we constructed an Escherichia coli lycopene production strain that does not carry a plasmid or an antibiotic marker. This was achieved using triclosan-induced chromosomal evolution, a high gene copy expression system. The engineered strain demonstrated high genetic stability in the absence of the selective agent during fermentation. The replacement of native appY promoter with a T5 promoter, and the deletion of the iclR gene in E. coli CBW 12241 further improved lycopene production. The resulting strain, E. coli CBW 12241(ΔiclR, PT5-appY), produced lycopene at 33.43 mg per gram of dry cell weight. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: A lycopene hyper-producer E. coli strain that does not carry a plasmid or antibiotic marker was constructed using triclosan-induced chromosomal evolution. The methods detailed in this study can be used to engineer E. coli to produce other metabolites.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We collected 553 earthworms mostly from two dominant families, the Megascolecidae and the Lumbricidae, from 12 sites. We constructed a molecular taxonomic unit tree based on the analysis of three genes to examine the effects of a biogeographic factor (dispersal ability) and an evolutionary factor (habitat adaptation) on the earthworm community assembly process. The phylogenetic distance of the earthworm communities among sites was positively correlated with geographic distance when intraspecific variation was included, indicating that the divergence within species was affected by biogeographic factors.

This project laid the groundwork for educational change by catalysing a national discussion of learning outcomes for Australian science graduates. The Science Threshold Learning Outcomes (TLOs) for graduates of bachelor-level degrees in science are endorsed by the Australian Council of Deans of Science and are publicaly available in the Science Standards Statement (Jones, Yates & Kelder, 2011). ::: ::: The next step is implementation of the Science TLOs through building a common understanding of how student achievement of the TLOs can be evidenced through learning activities and associated assessment tasks. This is timely as the sector positions itself to respond to the Learning Standards developed by the Higher Education Standards Panel (HESP). ::: ::: The Science Good Practice Guides (GPGs) are designed to provide practical advice and exemplars to assist with embedding the Science TLOs within programs. Each GPG includes: a short review of national and international research and practice, an annotated bibliography of resources, and a brief selection of good practice examples of teaching and assessment.

This project laid the groundwork for educational change by catalysing a national discussion of learning outcomes for Australian science graduates. The Science Threshold Learning Outcomes (TLOs) for graduates of bachelor-level degrees in science are endorsed by the Australian Council of Deans of Science and are publicaly available in the Science Standards Statement (Jones, Yates & Kelder, 2011). ::: ::: The next step is implementation of the Science TLOs through building a common understanding of how student achievement of the TLOs can be evidenced through learning activities and associated assessment tasks. This is timely as the sector positions itself to respond to the Learning Standards developed by the Higher Education Standards Panel (HESP). ::: ::: The Science Good Practice Guides (GPGs) are designed to provide practical advice and exemplars to assist with embedding the Science TLOs within programs. Each GPG includes: a short review of national and international research and practice, an annotated bibliography of resources, and a brief selection of good practice examples of teaching and assessment. They are authored by disciplinary experts recruited via a national call for expressions of interest. ::: ::: The Good Practice Guide for TLO 1 ('demonstrate a coherent understanding of science') has already been published (Yucel, 2012).

In this phase I trial, the safety of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib was studied. ::: ::: ::: PATIENTS AND METHODS ::: High-dose sorafenib was administered once weekly in exposure escalation cohorts according to a 3 + 3 design. Drug monitoring was performed in weeks 1-3 and doses were adjusted to achieve a predefined target plasma area under the curve (AUC)(0-12 h). The effect of low gastric pH on improving sorafenib exposure was investigated by intake of the acidic beverage cola. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Seventeen patients with advanced malignancies without standard treatment options were included. Once weekly, high-dose sorafenib exposure was escalated up to a target AUC(0-12 h) of 125-150 mg/L/h, achieving a twofold higher Cmax compared to standard continuous dosing. Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in three patients: grade 3 duodenal perforation (2800 mg sorafenib), grade 5 multiorgan failure (2800 mg sorafenib) and grade 5 biliary tract perforation (3600 mg sorafenib). The mean difference between observed and target AUC(0-12 h) was 45% (SD ± 56%) in week 1 using a fixed starting dose of sorafenib compared to 2% (SD ± 32%) in week 3 as a result of drug monitoring (P = 0.06). Dissolving sorafenib in cola, instead of water, did not improve sorafenib exposure. Clinical benefit with stable disease as the best response was observed in two patients. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Treatment with high-dose, once weekly sorafenib administration resulted in dose-limiting toxicity precluding dose escalation above the exposure cohort of 125-150 mg/L/h. Drug monitoring was a successful strategy to pursue a target exposure.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"
