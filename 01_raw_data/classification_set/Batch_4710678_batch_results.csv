Due to the non-linear hysteretic behavior, SMA wires require advanced control techniques for precision control when used as actuators. In this article, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed to compensate for the hysteretic non-linearity in a thin SMA wire. An experimental setup is designed to test the SMA wire, which can achieve an operating bandwidth of 1 Hz without an external cooling system. By using the data obtained from the experimental system, an ANFIS model is developed to model the major and minor hysteresis loops (voltage vs. displacement characteristics) and the hysteresis non-linearity at various driving frequencies. Results of numerical simulations based on the ANFIS model closely match the experimental data. Having demonstrated the ability of the ANFIS to account for the hysteretic behavior, an inverse...","https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109520608","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"
