The vidence from this sample of Chilean firms indicates that dollar-denominated debt is more used by larger firms and those more exposed to foreign competition. We find evidence that dollar denominated debt combines with exchange rate movements to produce a negative balance-sheet effect that reduces firm's investment in periods of strong exchange rate depreciation. This negative balance-sheet effect is associated with long term debt and appears to be non-linear in the amount of real exchange rate depreciation.","[{""country"":[""Chile""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The sample consisted of 108 children aged from 8 months (the initial stage of maturation of inhibitory control in reaching) to 11 months (the definitive stage). The main results showed the following: (1) at the population level, the preference of the right hand in the performance of tests that require a definite level of development of FMC appears only at the age of 11 months, i.e., synchronously with development of frontal inhibitory control of reaching; (2) the preference of the right hand is substantially stronger in 11-month-old children with a higher level of development of inhibitory motor control as compared to other children of the same age; (3) the preference of the right hand is most evident for those movements that require inhibitory control (i.e., controlled reaching). On the whole, the data obtained show that the appearance of a preference for the right hand in the second half-year of the life of an infant is caused by the development of cortical inhibitory control over motor acts (FMC), associated with the maturation of the frontal neocortex.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We propose a two-stage estimator. Given consistent parameter estimates from the selection equation obtained in the first stage, we estimate the semiparametric outcome equation using data for the observed individuals whose likelihood of being selected into the sample stays approximately the same over time. The selection bias term is then ""asymptotically"" removed from the equation along with fixed effects using kernel-based weights. The proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal.

In a comprehensive sample of I/B/E/S individual analysts' forecasts of annual earnings from 1983-1998, we find strong support for the claim in the post-1992 period. We examine whether the 'walk down' to beatable targets is associated with managers' incentives to sell stock after earnings announcements on the firm's behalf (via new equity issuance) or from their personal accounts (insider trades). Consistent with these hypotheses, we find that the 'walk down' to beatable targets is most pronounced in firms that are either net issuers of equity or in firms where managers are net sellers of stock after an earnings announcement. These findings provide new insights on how capital market incentives affect communications between managers and analysts.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

All tourism oriented companies, such as tour operators, travel agencies, rental agencies, cruisers and hotels experience the growing impact of what is commonly known as information and communication technology (ICT). Tourism sector represents the information-intensive industry characterized by a significantly long value chain influenced, to a great extent, by information. Its creation, collection, storage, retrieval and transfer remain within the core activities of all tourism enterprises. Every single innovation in IT sector can potentially change the strategy followed by tourism companies in running a business. Such transformations are also imposed by tourists’ behaviors which keep altering under the influence of information technology. The process of tourist services purchase is based on information collected through many different channels, e.g. travel agencies, brochures, the word-of-mouth, or web sides offered by tourist service suppliers, which are currently gaining much importance. Consumer decision making process in tourism sector is transformed into an online one, since direct service booking has become possible. ::: Proper understanding of behaviors presented by those searching for travel information online, as well as using innovative information and communication technologies by tourists, remain essential for designing an effective ICT-based business model. Currently it seems to be the crucial challenge for the entire tourism sector. ICT is focused on designing the new scientific paradigm (by innovation, co-opetition, collaboration with customers) of tourism development based on modern e-technologies. ::: The paper discusses the level of information and communication technologies application in the tourism sector. The study covers small and medium-size hotels (SMEs) and travel agencies which dominate the tourism industry worldwide. The article draws experience from the tourism industry in one of the most popular tourist destinations in Poland - Lower Silesia.","[{""country"":[""Poland""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The research was based on Ghanaian folklore for children, which is popularly known as ‘By the Fireside Stories’, encapsulated traditionally as Anansesem or Spider stories among the Akan of Ghana. Data were collected through storytelling to a group of children and inviting them to recall their concurrent thinking during and after the storytelling. The children’s cognitive recall processes were stimulated by questions and story character dramatisation recorded on a digital video recorder and played back to the children. Findings showed major contributions to children’s learning and development related to imagination, concept formation and thinking, and beyond the self in social relationship. This paper draws attention to how traditional oral storytelling can be an important part of early childhood education to develop children’s reflective thinking about social life.","[{""country"":[""Africa"",""Ghana""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The package of a product has a high propensity of attracting a first time buyer of a beauty product who has no prior contact of the product. In the same way, it can also turn away the first buyer too. Packaging actually serves many purposes, ranging from product protection to attracting consumer attention. It is the selling tool that should promote and sell the product by catching consumers attention, defining the product’s identity, providing information, ensuring safe use and protecting the product. This study therefore seek to find out how much the package of a beauty product goes into the decision making process of the consumer. A non probability sampling method was used to select the sample size. A sample size of 50 consisting of 40 users of beauty product and 10 sellers of beauty product in the New Juaben Municipality was used. The findings made in the research were that, females have the highest percentage when it comes to beauty product usage, whiles users of beauty product mostly prefer a rubber containers, consumers consider the package of a beauty product before they make a purchase, and the level of influence packaging have on the consumers’ buying decision was high. However, majority said that packaging does not guarantee quality, but rather packaging does help in the following ways; catching consumers attention, defining the product identity, and protecting the product. It is therefore recommended at the end of the research that manufacturers and retailers must not under play the role that packaging plays in bringing consumers to a particular product.","[{""country"":[""Ghana""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Second, the study examines the gains from separating the labour force into ordinary and knowledge labour – as a means to avoid double counting of R&D investments. Third, the paper examines the difference between recognising a firm as a member of an unspecified company group versus a multinational group. Fourth, the paper explores how well sales per employee serves as a proxy for labour productivity proper.

Specifically, it was focused on researching strategies of refusal used by the participant, emerging frequency of each strategies, as well as appropriateness and accuracy of each strategy used. Sixty students majoring in Tourism were involved in the project. Discourse completion task (DCT) containing an invitation using three sociocultural aspects of low power (-P), low distance (-D), and low rank of imposition (-R) was used to elicit participants’ refusal strategies. Taxonomy of refusal proposed by Beebe, Takahashi, and Uliss-Weltz (1990) was applied to recognize refusal strategies used by participants. Result of the study revealed that there were three strategies of ‘direct, indirect, and adjunct to refusal’ used by participants in responding the invitation. However, two new sub-strategies found to enrich indirect strategies, they are ‘alternative (change subject)’ and ‘telling wish’. Dealing with participants’ appropriateness and accuracy, it could be concluded that their appropriateness in producing semantic formulas were higher than their accuracy (96,55% and 40,83%) respectively. In addition, there were two contradictive propositions finally underscored upon analysis of appropriateness and accuracy. In term of appropriateness, it is implied that L2 proficiency does not guarantee learners’ high appropriateness, which is in contrast with the Cordina-Espurz’s (2013) finding. However, in term of accuracy, it implied that the lower learners’ L2 proficiency is the lower accuracy level they are in, which is in line with Cordina-Espurz’s (2013) finding.","[{""country"":[""Indonesia""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The community choice of the households is investigated within the framework of the random utility maximization model (RUM). A theoretical model with progressive income taxation is developed to identify the household preferences applied in the RUM. Different econometric specifications of the error term structure, such as conditional logit, nested logit and multinomial probit are compared.

This parallel system for approaching minor crime has oourished, even as the mainstream criminal system faces a crisis of legitimacy. This Article examines whether we can apply aspects of the community justice movement to improve the processing of serious crime in the mainstream criminal system. It assesses current community justice practices—community prosecution, community courts, sentencing circles, and citizen reparative boards—and ands that they have structural and procedural defects that should bar their use for serious crime. However, the chief innovation of the community justice movement—localized, popular decision-making—would alleviate many of the problems facing the criminal justice system. The Article argues that it may be possible to implement the goals of community justice while avoiding the defects of the current reform initiatives by restructuring the grand jury procedure and permitting local communities to sentence offenders.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Design/methodology/approach - The data is generated by a large-scale postal questionnaire which was informed by preliminary interviews. Further interviews were carried out to aid interpretation of the responses. Descriptive statistics on the importance and frequency of use of individual practices provide the basis for discussion.Findings - Direct costing is widely practiced and important, by contrast with activity-based costing and full absorption costing. Despite the limitations of conventional budgets, they remain a central management accounting 'pillar' and are frequently used in 'what if?' analyzes. The balanced scorecard and other non-financial performance measures are perceived to be important but never or rarely used by 40% of companies. Product profitability analyzes are frequently applied, and, surprisingly, the profitability of supplying individual customers is frequently calculated by over 50% of the population. Respondents were skeptical about sophisticated DCF investment appraisals.Practical implications - Traditional management accounting is 'alive and well' but there are indications of likely increased use of: information concerning the cost of quality; non-financial measures relating to employees and analyzes of competitors' strengths and weaknesses.

The essay concludes that flat bans on metadata mining are misguided and that the issue should be treated in the same manner as inadvertent disclosures more generally. Under this approach, if a state permits lawyers to review inadvertently disclosed privileged documents, the jurisdiction should also permit lawyers to review the metadata contained in electronic documents. In contrast, if a jurisdiction prohibits the review of misdirected privileged documents, the state should ban metadata mining, but only when recipients have reason to believe that the metadata contains protected information.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

First ( M age = 6.42, SD = 0.60) and fifth ( M age = 10.71, SD = 0.43) graders were asked to choose between sheets of paper with red or green borders to carry out two kinds of activities (i.e., evaluative vs. recreational). Analysis of the results showed that the older children tended to avoid the red-bordered paper for the evaluative tasks, whereas the younger children chose red for both kinds of activities. These findings suggest that context-driven red‐meaning associations develop across grades.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The airport’s effect on LUCC is evaluated by comparing the actual pattern from 1996 to 2001 with a counterfactual simulated land use pattern that would have occurred without the intervention of airport construction. This research is based on land use maps from Landsat images that were analyzed by supervised classification and visual interpretation. To simulate the land use pattern occurring without airport construction, the counterfactual, we applied a cellular automata (CA)–Markov model. Through before and after comparison, we found that cultivated land has decreased and that constructed land has increased because of airport construction. However, according to the counterfactual scenario, airport construction to some extent prevented a decrease in cultivated land and decelerated the expansion of constructed land at a small scale and in the short term. We discuss several reasons for this result, including governmental regulations, such as the setting of the airport clearance area for the safety of plane take-off and landing, the adverse effects of aviation noise or pollution, which may limit the construction activities in the surrounding areas of the airport, and, importantly, the unique land use and land management system in China, mainly the cultivated land requisition-compensation balance policy. We conclude that (1) the counterfactual CA–Markov model simulation is a suitable and unbiased way of evaluating the effect of infrastructure on LUCC that can solve the deficiency in the previous literature relying on before and after comparisons and (2) regulatory, economic, and institutional factors should be considered when explaining and assessing the LUCC due to large infrastructure projects, such as airports, in China and in other countries.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Results from 463 participants showed the majority (78%) reported studying in a group at least once per semester, with younger students engaging in more frequent group sessions. Reasons for choosing group study included both learning and social factors. The majority experienced higher motivation and learning from group study, but the majority also generally prefer individual over group study. Regarding self-regulated learning choices in a group setting, these did vary by discipline, but the most commonly used strategies overall were active, empirically supported ones such as practice problems, discussion, quizzing/testing, questioning, and making flashcards. In addition, several group study strategies were correlated with GPA, including making mnemonics, making flashcards, and distributed (spaced) study sessions. More advanced students tended to use discussion-based strategies during group study, and lower-level students were more likely to report content-driven strategies such as quizzing/testing and flashcards. Also, frequency of group study was correlated with using more evidence-supported strategies, more efficient use of time, perceived improvements in learning, and preference for group study. Given that group study appears to be a common part of the undergraduate educational experience, we conclude with implications and future directions for learning scientists and educators.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Long-term linear trends have been found in the difference between the core CPI and the headline CPI in the USA. Duration of these periods is different for positive (18 years) and negative (8 years) trends, and the trends change to opposite during some shorter time intervals of 2 to 4 years. The difference between the core CPI and the index for energy is similar to that between the core CPI and headline CPI. The index for energy will reach the core CPI in 2008, however. Then, one should not expect further increase in energy price beyond that dictated by the CPI. It is likely that oil price will be falling in absolute terms. The difference between the core CPI and the index for food also has two linear branches after 1980, but the slope of the current trend is weak and the difference will intercept zero line only in 2014. The difference between the core CPI and the housing index is characterized by an almost constant duration of negative and positive branches i?½ approximately 11 years. The current period of negative slope in the difference will approach its turning point in 2008 or 2009 and is characterized by very high volatility. The next trend has to be positive, i.e. the housing index will be growing at a lower rate than the headlining CPI. The difference for the transportation index had a longer period of positive slope i?½ between 1980 and 2004. During this period the difference reached the level of 30 units of index. Currently, a turning period is observed and a negative slope is developing.

For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situa...","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Pre-term children born low birth weight are at risk for behavioral and emotional difficulties, however, little is known about how these difficulties manifest and interact with biological risk and environmental factors. This study examined the extent to which children’s language and dyadic relationship factors facilitate affect regulation and behavior problems in low birth weight children (LBW). Sixty-eight preschool-age children and their mothers participated in the study. Children were administered an assessment of cognitive functioning in which verbal ability was examined, and engaged in a laboratory frustration task designed to elicit negative affect to assess emotion regulation. Results revealed correlations among verbal ability, behavior problems, behavioral synchrony, and emotion regulation. Group Differences were found in verbal ability and positive affect in which LBW children demonstrated lower verbal ability scores and less positive affect than full-term children. For the full sample, behavior synchrony moderated the relationship between verbal ability and negative emotion regulation. The results provide evidence of the importance of the functional role of language and dyadic relations in the development of affect regulation and behavior problems. The results also elucidate the importance of integrating social emotional information in developing interventions for pre-term children.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Further on, it is not obvious whether these policy instruments rather repress innovation and economic growth than induce a shift toward a greener technology. To address these questions we investigate an endogenous growth model in an environmental context, introduced by M. Rauscher (Green R&D versus end-of-pipe emission abatement: a model of directed technical change (Thuenen-Series of Applied Economic Theory, Working Paper 106), 2009). Rauscher investigates the impact of environmental standards on capital accumulation and R&D investments in an economy where both, brown (dirty) as well as green (clean) capital can be used in production. While Rauscher keeps the problem formulation rather general without assuming specific model functions, our focus is to apply optimal control theory to a specific scenario of this model.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

A geometrically focused piston transducer is used as the acoustic source. Signals are cross-correlated to find the true sound speed during the measurement to make the simulated and measured pulses in phase for comparisons. The calculated sound speed in the measurement is varied between 1487.45 m/s and 1487.75 m/s by using different initial values in the ASA simulation. Results from the pulsed ASA simulations using both Field II simulated and hydrophone measured acoustic sources are compared to the Field II simulated and hydrophone measured pulses, respectively. The total relative root mean square (RMS) errors of the pulsed ASA are investigated by using different time-point, zero-padding factors, spatial sampling interval and temporal sampling frequency in the simulation. Optimal parameters for the ASA are found in the simulation. The RMS error of the ASA simulation is reduced from 10.9% to 2.4% for the optimal parameters when comparing to Field II simulations. The comparison between the ASA calculated and measured pulses are illustrated and the corresponding RMS error is 25.4%.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The experiment tests the effect of virtual currency endowments on player retention and virtual currency demand. An increase in endowments of a virtual currency should lower the demand for the currency in the short run. However, in the long run, we would expect money demand to rise in response to inflation in the virtual world. We test for this behavior in a virtual field experiment in the football management game Top11. 575,000 players were selected at random and allocated to different ""shards"" or versions of the world. The shards differed only in terms of the initial money endowment offered to new players. Money demand was observed for 28 days as players used real money to purchase additional virtual currency. The results indicate that player money purchases were significantly higher in the shards where higher endowments were given. This suggests that a positive change in the money supply in a virtual context leads to inflation and increased money demand, and does so much more quickly than in real-world economies. Differences between virtual and real currency behavior will become more interesting as virtual currency becomes a bigger part of the real economy.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, most previous studies consider only one of these types of risk, or focus on audit risk rather than business risk to estimate auditor efforts. This study investigates the simultaneous effects of audit risk and business risk on auditor efforts. The data of Korean listed firm is used and business risk is measured by the degree of market competition. This study verifies that when audit risk and business risk are considered simultaneously, the effect of audit risk on audit fees and hours diminishes with lower business risk. Auditors are less concerned about audit risk in less competitive markets than in highly competitive markets because auditor is less exposed to litigation risk due to the nature of less competition. In addition, this study investigates the unilateral effect of fluctuations in business risk on auditor efforts. As a result, the study provides evidence that market competition is significantly associated with auditor efforts in terms of audit fees and hours.","[{""country"":[""Korea, Dem.

The early local champions of the socio-political developments were those who had acquired western education. The role of these emergent elite in forming associations to champion the cause of their people tends to earn them a voice in their grassroots politics. The Kabba Divisional Union (KDU) formed in 1964, which attempted to severe the political allegiance of the area from the Northern Peoples Congress (NPC), and change the political history of the Division was one of such associations. The focus of this work is on the remarkable role of the western educated elite in the socio-political developments of Kabba Division. It highlights the dynamics of socio-political change in Kabba Division. Attempt is made through this discourse to provide a better appreciation of developments at grassroots and regional levels. The paper contends that the failure of the NPC – controlled regional government to seriously enhance the socio-political and economic status of Kabba people in the region, caused a major shift in the political leaning of the people of Kabba Division. The paper concludes that general competing interests not withstanding, the western educated elite in Kabba helped to overcome the traditional isolation of the area by providing the organizational vehicle through which the Division participated meaningfully in the wider Nigerian political system.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Three hundred samples of N1 acrylic resin were used: 100 samples for color stability and microhardness tests (each test was performed on the opposite side of each sample), and 200 samples for flexural strength testing (100 samples before and after 1,008 hours of accelerated aging). Samples for each test were separated into ten groups (n=10), ie, without nanoparticles (control group) or with nanoparticles of zinc oxide, titanium dioxide (TiO2), and barium sulfate at weight concentrations of 1%, 2%, and 2.5% (nanoparticle groups). Data were subjected to statistical analysis with nested analysis of variance and Tukey’s test (P<0.05 significance level). Among the nanoparticle groups, the TiO2 groups showed better color stability at all concentrations. Microhardness values increased after artificial aging, except for the control and zinc oxide groups. After aging, the 1%–2% TiO2 groups had significantly higher microhardness values compared with the other nanoparticle groups. Before aging, there was a significant difference in flexural strength between the control and nanoparticle groups. After aging, the control and TiO2 groups, regardless of concentration, showed the lowest flexural strength values. Incorporation of nanoparticles directly influenced the acrylic resin properties, with TiO2 being the most influential nanoparticle in terms of the evaluated properties.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Over the past years, a number of technical and theories for analysis has evolved; these combined with modern technology guides, which serve the purpose of an investor. The giant players in the market, like Foreign Insti- tutional Investors, Mutual Funds, etc. have the expertise skill and access for various analytical tools and make use of them. Most of the small investors are not in position to benefit out from market the way Mutual Funds do. Generally small inves- tor's investments are based on the market sentiments, inside information, through grapevine, tips and institution. The small investors heavily depend upon brokers and broking house for their investments. They can invest through the Mutual Fund who is more experienced and expert in this field than a small investor himself. In recent years a large number of players have entered into this market. The paper has been carried out to study an over- view of Mutual Fund Industry and to understand investor's perception about Mutual Funds in the context of their trading performance, explore investors risk perception and find out their preference over top Mutual Funds. This study is to understand how to evaluate of mutual funds. The objective is to evaluate the investment performance of Indian equity mutual fund with risk adjustment by using the theoretical parameters as suggested by William, Sharpes, Treynor, and Jensen model.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The results reveal a positive relation between the payoffs earned by the subjects and their history-inspection effort. Subjects act as if responding to the average bidding-ratios of the winners in the samples that they have retrieved. They apply intuitive signal-dependent stopping rules like “sample until observing a winner-value close to my won” or “find a close winner-value and try one more history” when sampling the databases. History-inspection directs bidders with relatively high private-valuations to moderate bidding which increases their realized payoffs.

Main barriers were identified and differences between programs were analyzed. Associations between barriers and client background characteristics were investigated. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The most common barriers were failure to engage and disengagement from services, followed by substance abuse. Staff from the two employment programs reported similar barriers. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Engagement problems were the single most important barrier to employment across programs. Surprisingly, criminal history was rarely mentioned. This may be explained by barriers arising earlier in the process, before achieving employer contact. The results call for recognition and awareness of the importance of motivational issues as well as factors that may inhibit engagement in services, highlighting possible augmentations to evidence-based employment services that may be necessary in the rehabilitation of this patient group.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The NGO sector is funded primarily by international non-governmental organizations and bilateral donors. We find large differences in size and funding across NGOs, with only a few NGOs attracting most of the funding. Most NGOs are small and underfunded and focus on raising awareness and advocacy. Few NGOs are faith based. Most screening and monitoring is done by grant agencies. Some monitoring is also done internally by members and trustees. Little monitoring is done by government. NGOs do not file income tax returns, and few respondents are able to provide coherent financial accounts.","[{""country"":[""Uganda""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Specifically, the authors examine whether banks seek out those markets where institutional familiarity provides them with a competitive advantage over other foreign competitor banks. Using bilateral data on banking sector foreign direct investment in all developing countries and controlling for other factors, they find that competitive advantage is an important factor in driving foreign banks'location decisions.

Methods : A retrospective study compared the data of surgical procedures, pathological features and prognosis of 61 cases of young females (≤ 40 years) and 507 cases of elderly females (> 40 years), treated in our department from August 2011 to July 2018. This data was analyzed using SPSS 23.0 program. Results : 10.74% of total cases, in this period of time, involve young females. In terms of surgical procedures, 24.59% of young patients underwent breast conserving surgery (8.48% elderly, respectively), and 13.11% underwent reconstruction surgery (1.18% elderly, respectively), with statistically significant differences existing between the two groups ( P < 0.05). Progesterone receptor (PR) expression in young women was significantly higher than in elderly females ( P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), expression of estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and Ki-67, but the lymphatic metastasis stage showed an increasing rate with younger age. No significant difference was found in 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Conclusion : The selection rate of breast conserving and reconstructive surgery in young women with breast cancer is significantly higher than that in elderly women. The younger the patient, the more frequently the PR positive expression, and the more likely ALNM to occur. The 3-year prognosis of the young and elderly patients is similar.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The women job-seekers find jobs in banks more attractive and more suitable to their nature. Banks also were not only not averse to taking them but even welcomed their entry because women have certain innate traits which fit in with the job requirements. Thus the humongous increase in job opportunities in banks and the abundant availability of qualified women who get selected in job tests paved the way for the large number of women occupying positions in all cadres today in not only public sector and private sector banks but even in new generation banks. Indian women is distinct from their western counter parts in that they do not shed their conventional roles as mothers and house wives inspire of their professional responsibilities. They are skilled at blending professional excellence and traditional love for home harmoniously. In the process of balancing work and home life, they encounter a plethora of problems. The study is purely exploratory in nature and seeks to identify the factors preventing women employees from aspiring for higher post and problems hindering the work performance of women executives in private sector banks in Puducherry state.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the approach and status of sustainable, low-carbon transport policy in ASEAN countries and identifies differences and similarities. The methodology is based on a taxonomy of policy components as developed by Howlett and Cashore. The data come from comprehensive country studies for Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam and interviews with policymakers. We find that each country has a specific set of goals, objectives and targets that support sustainable transport, and, directly or indirectly, climate change mitigation. In terms of specific mechanisms and calibrations, which we analyse based on the Avoid−Shift−Improve approach, there are notable differences between the countries, for example in terms of fuel economy policy. Even though an initial response to climate change mitigation challenges is visible in these countries’ transport policies, much more effort is required to enable a transition to a transport system compatible with long-term climate change and sustainable development targets.","[{""country"":[""Indonesia"",""Philippines"",""Thailand"",""Vietnam""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Developing a Severity-scoring Model of Complex Emergency Affected Countries in Order to Ensure Needs Based Funding.","Background: Disasters affect close to 400 million people each year. Complex Emergencies (CE) are a category of disaster that affects nearly half of the 400 million and often last for several years. To support the people affected by CE, humanitarian assistance is provided with the aim of saving lives and alleviating suffering. It is widely agreed that funding for this assistance should be needs-based. However, to date, there is no model or set of indicators that quantify and compare needs from one CE to another. In an effort to support needs-based and transparent funding of humanitarian assistance, the aim of this study is to develop a model that distinguishes between levels of severity among countries affected by CE.Methods: In this study, severity serves as a predictor for level of need. The study focuses on two components of severity: vulnerability and exposure. In a literature and Internet search we identified indicators that characterize vulnerability and exposure to CE. Among the more than 100 indicators identified, a core set of six was selected in an expert ratings exercise. Selection was made based on indicator availability and their ability to characterize preexisting or underlying vulnerabilities (four indicators) or to quantify exposure to a CE (two indicators). CE from 50 countries were then scored using a 3-tiered score (Low-Moderate, High, Critical). Results: The developed model builds on the logic of the Utstein template. It scores severity based on the readily available value of four vulnerability and four exposure indicators. These are 1) GNI per capita, PPP, 2) Under-five mortality rate, per 1 000 live births, 3) Adult literacy rate, % of people ages 15 and above, 4) Underweight, % of population under 5 years, and 5) number of persons and proportion of population affected, and 6) number of uprooted persons and proportion of population uprooted.Conclusion: The model can be used to derive support for transparent, needs-based funding of humanitarian assistance. Further research is needed to determine its validity, the robustness of indicators and to what extent levels of scoring relate to CE outcome.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study examines policy legacies associated with the introduction of psychiatric hospitals in the 1850s and the introduction of public health insurance (medicare) in the 1960s in Ontario; and their effect on subsequent mental health reform initiatives using a qualitative case study approach. Following Pierson (1993) we capture the resource/incentive and interpretive effects of prior policies on three groups of actors: government elites, interests and mass publics. Data is drawn from academic and policy literature, and key informant interviews. The findings suggest that psychiatric hospital policy resulted in important policy legacies which were reinforced by medicare. These legacies explain the traditional difficulty in achieving mental health reform, but are less helpful in explaining recent promising developments that support community-based care. Current reform of the Ontario health system features the introduction of regionalized service delivery and new models of interdisciplinary team-based primary care delivery and presents an opportunity to overcome several of these legacies. The analysis suggests a pressing need to link these two initiatives to overcome system fragmentation.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The locus of morphological representation in the lexicon","It is demonstrated that the meaning given to an ambiguous word (e.g., stick) can be biased by the masked presentation of a polymorphemic word derived from that meaning (e.g., sticky). No bias in interpretation is observed when the masked prime is a word that is semantically related to the target with no morphological relationship (e.g., glue), though such a semantically based bias is revealed when the prime is unmasked. Because the masked priming results cannot be explained in terms of facilitation of processing at either the form level or the semantic level, it is concluded that an intermediate level provides the locus of the effect, referred to here as the ‘lemma’ level. Thus, any model of lexical processing needs to incorporate such an intermediate level to capture the relationship between stem morphemes and their derived forms.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Korpi and Palme have influentially claimed that ""the more we target benefits at the poor, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality"". The basic empirical underpinning of this claim is a strong inverse relationship at the country level between social transfer targeting and redistributive impact. We show that this no longer holds as a robust empirical generalisation. The relationship between the extent of targeting and redistributive impact over a broad set of empirical specifications, country selections and data sources has in fact become a very weak one. For what it matters, targeting tends to be associated with higher levels of redistribution, especially when overall effort in terms of spending is high. We try to make substantive sense of this breakdown of the originally established relationship by focusing on two questions: first, what has changed in the countries originally included in the study and, second, what is different about the countries now additionally included in the analysis?","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For faster new product development decisions, we implement a flexible prioritization methodology for product features and concepts, one that scales up in the number of testable alternatives, limited only by the number of participants. Preferences are measured by trading stocks whose prices are based upon share of choice of new products and features. We develop a conceptual model of scalable preference markets, and test it experimentally.

Consistent with our findings from previous work, party leaders appeared to construct more moderate and less divisive agendas in lame-duck sessions, which reflected leaders’ reduced ability to influence the behavior of departing members. The ability of party leaders to exert pressure in lame-duck sessions did not disappear, however, but rather took a different form: that of getting returning members to participate actively on roll-call votes. Our analyses of members’ roll-call participation across congressional sessions reveals that departing members significantly increased their abstention levels in lame-duck sessions, while returning members significantly decreased their abstention levels.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Focusing on our colleagues’ work, we will highlight the contribution of the PQS to research in psychotherapy, not only in process-outcome studies, but also into the therapeutic action debates, the specific vs common factors discussion, and the insight vs relation dialect. According to our studies, PQS has played the most relevant and innovative role in psychoanalysis. Ablon et al. showed how Jones left the clinical inheritance of his empirical method. One of PQS’s strengths deals with the Q-sort methodology (Block, 1961; Stephenson, 1953) that enables both an empirical study of human subjectivity (McKnown & Thomas, 1988) and the application of rigorous data analysis for single-case designs, such as the P-technique and time series analysis. PQS, as colleagues have shown, is useful in single-case designs that, despite their limitations in the generalization of the findings (Kazdin, 2002), capture the richness and complexity of the clinical dialogue and describe the uniqueness of the patient and therapist dyad and interaction structures.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Clinically, radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RIN) is defined as a sudden decline in renal function after radiocontrast administration. Typically, the serum creatinine level begins to increase at 24 to 72 hours after the administration of contrast, peaks at 3 to 5 days, and requires another 3 to 5 days to return to baseline. RIN increases the incidence of life-threatening complications such as sepsis, bleeding, and respiratory failure and increases the cost of medical care by extending the hospital stay. The increased mortality associated with acute renal failure encountered in this scenario calls for a heightened awareness of the diagnosis and prevention of RIN. Whereas individuals with healthy renal function are not generally considered to be at particular risk for RIN, patients with preexisting renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus are much more likely to experience acute renal failure after contrast administration. In the past, a variety of therapeutic interventions have been used to prevent or attenuate RIN, including saline hydration, diuretics, mannitol, calcium channel antagonists, theophylline, endothelin receptor antagonists, hemodialysis, and dopamine. More recently, studies demonstrate a positive impact of fenoldopam (dopamine-1 receptor, dopamine-1 agonist) and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine in ameliorating RIN. This article discusses the pathophysiology, risk factors, and prevention of RIN.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

For long-term success, the campaign must also address the root causes of the insecurity that spawned conflict in the first place. In this monograph, British academic and practitioner Dr. Shima Keene describes a number of ways in which financial intelligence can be leveraged not only to disrupt adversary activities, but also to provide indicators and warnings of future actions and, ultimately, to address underlying insecurities. Dr. Keene was previously both a banker and a British Army reservist. In this monograph, she uses her expertise as a threat finance specialist to outline specific areas where financial intelligence analysis techniques, which are common in the private sector, can be applied to combating insurgency, terrorism, and other hard security threats. Dr. Keene argues that financial disruption techniques used in counterinsurgency have been poorly coordinated and at times counterproductive, and cites the targeting of the Hawala money transfer system as a specific example.

The Strategic Studies Institute recommends this monograph not only to counterinsurgency and counterterrorism practitioners and policymakers, but also to the Intelligence community more widely; all of these will find its conclusions on the handling of financial data and the value of threat finance analysis valuable.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It is important to know the impact of local development process on income inequality. Not only the impacts of local development, but also other factors determining the trend of income inquality (i.e.fuel price raises, price and income adjustment policies) give impact on present income inequality. Nowaydays, the local development policies and the other factors are predicted that they give impact on the raise of recent income inquality in Banyumas. Based on Gini coefficient measurement method, we obtain startling result. The result presented in this paper is based on a sample of 180 households including urban area, sub urban area and rural area. The Gini coefficient result is 0,603. This result shows the sharp raise of income inequality from past time to recent in Banyumas. The imbalance of development between modern sectors (i.e services, contruction, finance, trade and manufacture) and traditional sectors (i.e agriculture and informal sector) causes the raise of income inequality. Based on this trend of the raise of income inequality, local government must practice pro poor development policies without ignoring sustainable economic growth and especially focusing on agriculture, rural economy, informal sector, small and medium industries.

Resection of mesial structures of the temporal lobes, however, entails a significant risk of decreased memory function. Recent advances in the assessment of memory changes following temporal lobectomy surgery emphasize the complexity of subjective ratings of memory functioning in this population. Neuroimaging tools useful in the diagnostic evaluation of epilepsy surgical candidates have now been shown to be useful in predicting memory change in the post-surgical period. Functional magnetic resonance imaging appears to provide significant information regarding hemispheric representation of language in the temporal lobe epilepsy patient, and the use of this technique to predict memory status following surgery appears promising. Clinical studies involving patients who had temporal lobectomy surgeries have also revealed changes in emotional learning related to the degree of amygdala involvement. Moreover, there is increasing evidence to suggest that differential changes in emotional learning occur among patients with right versus left temporal lobe resections.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings were subjected to defoliation treatments by removing 50, 75 % or all of the leaves. Root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) was sharply reduced in plants defoliated for 1 day and 1 week. The decrease in L pr could not be prevented by stem girdling and it was accompanied in one-day-defoliated plants by a large decrease in the root expression of PIP1,2 aquaporin and an over twofold decrease in hydraulic conductivity of root cortical cells (L pc). Contrary to L pr and L pc, 50 and 75 % defoliation treatments profoundly increased leaf lamina conductance (K lam) after 1 day and this increase was similar in magnitude for both defoliation treatments. Transpiration rates (E) rapidly declined after the removal of 75 % of leaves. However, E increased by over twofold in defoliated plants after 1 day and the increases in E and K lam were accompanied by five- and tenfold increases in the leaf expression of PIP2;4 in 50 and 75 % defoliation treatments, respectively. Defoliation treatments also stimulated net photosynthesis after 1 day and 3 weeks, although the increase was not as high as E. Leaf water potentials remained relatively stable following defoliation with the exception of a small decrease 1 day after defoliation which suggests that root water transport did not initially keep pace with the increased transpirational water loss. The results demonstrate the importance of root and leaf hydraulic properties in plant responses to defoliation and point to the involvement of PIP aquaporins in the early events following the loss of leaves.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The design was quasi-experimental. The Population comprised 3,366 SSII chemistry students. A sample of 602 students from 6 schools (339 males and 263 females) was drawn from the population using balloting technique. The experimental groups were taught with IIS and CLIS while the control groups were taught with Lecture method, in each of the sampled schools. Both the experimental and control groups were taught organic chemistry by their regular chemistry teachers. The instruments used for the study were Chemistry Achievement Test on Organic Chemistry (CATOC), Cooperative Learning Instructional Manual and Learning Activity Package Manual which were validated by three experts. The reliability of the CATOC was determined using K-R 20 with index of .82. The research questions were answered using mean with standard deviation while the null hypotheses were tested using Analysis of Covariance. The findings revealed that both IIS and CLIS significantly enhanced students’ achievement in Organic Chemistry better than the Lecture method, but the CLIS was more effective than the IIS. The researcher recommended among others, that chemistry students should be exposed to student-centred and activity-based teaching strategies such as the Individualised Instructional Strategy and Cooperative Learning Instructional Strategy, for enhanced students’ academic achievement.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Factors related to workplace hypertension were assessed with multiple regression analysis. Workplace hypertension, defined as a BP no less than 140/90 mmHg, was observed in 23% of subjects (n=61). Compared with subjects without workplace hypertension (n=204), subjects with workplace hypertension were older (48.5+/-10.0 vs. 39.3+/-10.0 years), more likely to be men (69% vs. 46%), and had a higher body mass index (BMI) (23.4+/-2.7 vs. 21.6+/-3.2 kg/m(2)), higher cholesterol levels (214+/-33 vs. 194+/-36 mg/dl), and a higher Brinkman index (134+/-228 vs. 59+/-148). Subjects with workplace hypertension had higher BPs at checkup than did those without it (125+/-11/79+/-9 vs. 110+/-11/68+/-9 mmHg). The increases in BPs at the workplace were independently and significantly correlated with BMI, and a family history of hypertension. BP no less than 130/ 85 mmHg at health checkup was a good detector of workplace hypertension (sensitivity, 49%; specificity, 91%), suggesting that subjects with high-normal BPs at health checkup might have workplace hypertension. In conclusion, workplace hypertension was found to be associated with age, BMI, a family history of hypertension, and high-normal BPs at health checkup.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In recent years, many papers related to Internet addiction pop up like mushroom and bamboo shoots after rain.

Hence, to visit scenic spots and to understand the truth, researchers devote ambition to construct the motive theory and to explain network behavior intended to unearth its implication on the general technology education. Study group discovered that the motive theory concerning network behavior was based on inquiring and searching of related data. After clarification, the questionnaire for empirical study was composed. There were 574 students selected as the testing samples from four universities. The results showed that the MSMT had a great mysterious extent from beginning to end, and also obtained the interaction with one another among flow experience, peak phenomenon, and Internet addiction. We established MSMT for the instruction of general technology education. If teachers could handle the information of network learning and explore the truth to solve the problem, then students would enhance their on-line learning and pursue for truth. Finally, several suggestions were proposed: to compile a more rigid questionnaire; to spread the MSMT; to occupy the status of general technology education; to keep track of more understanding on similar study.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Police officers are instructed to ask these questions in order to allow participants in the criminal procedure to assess the reliability of the testimony. In everyday interaction, asking “how someone knows” implies that what was said earlier is not taken for granted. Therefore, questions about sources of knowledge in police interviews are potentially delicate. This paper aims to show that (a) questions about sources of knowledge are related to a specialized institutional inference system and (b) children sometimes treat those questions as causing a dilemma between the need to provide an answer and the unusual character of the question. Drawing on insights from conversation analysis, the analysis focuses on occasions when children present their answer about the source of their knowledge as self-evident. These responses suggest that the question is not genuine and legitimate. At the same time, children still try to provide a relevant answer. The self-evident answers thus deal with the explicit request for a source of knowledge and, from their perspective, the unnecessary character of the question. Police officers generally ignore the self-evident aspect of the answers in their uptakes. Yet, when they do orient to it, they justify their questions as genuine information seeking questions. Police officers thus treat sources of knowledge as something they did not know, whereas sources of knowledge often can be inferred in everyday language use. We suggest that taking this unknowing stance conveys to the child and to the tape that the police officers are not presuming specific sources of knowledge.","[{""country"":[""Netherlands""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of Korean sport literature with regard to CSR practices (ES-linked) of different stakeholder groups and examine through a meta-analytic methodology their impact on the “images” of these groups. The CMA program was utilized as the main analysis tool to calculate the effect sizes from the selected empirical studies. The results indicated that CSR performance of governmental organizations had the highest effect size level on their own image (brand identity) as perceived by visitors and participants. Among the stakeholder groups, effect size levels of their CSR performances were followed by those of corporate sponsors and professional teams. It was found that stakeholder groups are pressured to maintain a balance between financial performance, consumer well-being, and brand identity to bring in external investment.","[{""country"":[""Korea, Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

One successful model of private investment in the large scale provision of rental housing has been that of Defence Housing Australia (DHA). In 2009, DHA had a portfolio of over 17,000 dwellings valued at over $7 billion that were owned by a mix of public, private individual and institutional investors. Essentially the DHA has a number of functions, it: constructs housing buys housing sells housing (to dispose of it) sells housing to investors (called non-DHA housing in this report) and leases it back on long-term leases manages tenancies maintains houses (including essential maintenance for its leaseback properties) refurbishes housing relocates tenants. The non-DHA properties are managed by the DHA for fixed periods typically up to 12 years and are on-leased to service personnel. The financial and operational parameters of this model has many features in common with intended directions for affordable housing signalled under recent national and state policies—especially plans to promote private ownership of affordable housing and to encourage larger scale housing managers, with a focus on the potential of the not-for-profit housing sector. The aim of the project is very straightforward: ‘to determine the potential lessons of the DHA model for affordable housing provision’. To address this aim, the study will consider the following specific research questions: What are the characteristics of the rental housing investment and business models operated by the DHA and how have these developed and performed across market cycles? What benchmarks can be established for key performance areas including returns to investors and asset and tenancy management? What implications can be drawn from the DHA model for the emerging affordable rental housing sector?","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Given these facets, and the recognized status of bats as reservoirs for rabies viruses (RABVs) in the Americas, individual bats may experience repeated exposure to RABV during their lifetime. Nevertheless, little information exists with regard to within-host infection dynamics and the role of immunological memory that may result from abortive RABV infection in bats. In this study, a cohort of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) was infected intramuscularly in the left and right masseter muscles with varying doses [10−0.1–104.9 median mouse intracerebral lethal doses (MICLD50)] of an E. fuscus RABV variant isolated from a naturally infected big brown bat. Surviving bats were infected a second time at 175 days post-(primary) infection with a dose (103.9–104.9 MICLD50) of the same RABV variant. Surviving bats were infected a third time at either 175 or 305 days post-(secondary) infection with a dose (104.9 MICLD50) of the same RABV variant. When correcting for dose, similar mortality was observed following primary and secondary infection, but reduced mortality was observed following the third and last RABV challenge, despite infection with a high viral dose. Inducible RABV-neutralizing antibody titres post-infection were ephemeral among infected individuals, and dropped below levels of detection in several bats between subsequent infections. These results suggest that long-term repeated infection of bats may confer significant immunological memory and reduced susceptibility to RABV infection.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As a transition economy, Poland provides an interesting case for study, as its sudden opening to foreign investment after a long period of isolation allows the process of integratio into global networks to be studies more clearly. Using Poland as a case study, the authors study multinational corporatios'role in integrating a host country into the increasingly international division of labor. They provide evidence that inflows of foreign direct investment are increasing Poland's participation in global production and distribution networks.

The main focus of these studies have been on comparing the effectiveness of concept mapping to traditional teaching practices such as the lecture method. This research, however, compares concept mapping to tutorial sheets strategy in teaching circular and rotational motion. A sample of 70 students participated in the experiment. An equivalent number of 35 students were assigned to the control and experimental group. The control group used tutorial sheets while the experimental group used concept mapping. A pre-test and post-test was administered to the two groups. A t-test was used to compare the means of the group’s test scores. The mean score for the experimental group’s post test was higher than the mean score of the control group. This showed that concept mapping was more effective than the tutorial sheet strategy.

In the Americas, ~300,000 bites occur annually, leaving 84,110–140,981 envenomings and 652–3466 deaths. Here, we modeled current and future snakebite risk using ecological niche models (ENMs) of 90 venomous snake taxa. Current snakebite risk predictions were corroborated by incidence data from eight regions/periods with different characteristics. Detailed projections of potential future range shifts on distributions of the medically most relevant species indicated that North American species’ ranges are likely to increase in the future, but mixed results were obtained for Latin American snakes. A likely expansion of overall risk area and an increase of rural population at risk were observed from a consensus model among future scenarios. Our study highlights the capacity of ENMs to provide detailed information on current and future potential distributions of venomous snakes, as well as useful perspectives on snakebite risk, at least broad scales.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

These practices can be shared and learned to increase the probability of brand integration success in future M&As. The paper adopts the case-study method by interviewing several top-level executives, M&A managers, functional managers and members of M&A projects which have been involved in M&As. Twenty practices are outlined and defined after analysing ten M&A events within six case companies (which are multinational corporations – MNCs). The paper provides managers with insights into good (or winning) practices that MNCs have adopted in integrating brands in their M&As by addressing a number of specific issues and corresponding solutions. The twenty practices for the integration of brands in M&As are classified into eight major clusters according to the dimensions of brand and brand management these practices are related to – brand strategic positioning, brand people, brand knowledge transfer, brand integration planning, brand integration implementation, brand disposal expertise, brand disposal negotiation, and brand due diligence. These clusters allow M&A and integration managers to accumulate their own brand integration practices from time to time systematically. These also help facilitate the adoption of a learning approach by firms to their later M&As.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Different cell types have been employed as a supportive cell layer, including human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and human mammary fibroblasts. However, these sources of human tissue-derived cells are limited, and more readily accessible human or animal tissue-derived cell sources would simplify the endothelial cell co-culture assay. In the present study, we investigated the potential use of alternative, accessible supportive cells for endothelial cell co-culture assay, including human umbilical cord and ovine carotid artery. ::: ::: ::: METHODS AND RESULTS ::: Human umbilical artery SMCs (HUASMCs) and ovine carotid artery-derived cells were seeded into 96-well plates, followed by addition of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Nine days after co-culture, cells were fixed, immunostained and analysed using an in vitro angiogenesis quantification tool. Capillary-like structures were detected on ovine carotid artery-derived supportive cell layers. The initial cell number, as well as pro- and anti-angiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF-BB and Bevacizumab), had a positive or negative influence on the number of capillary-like structures. Furthermore, HUVECs from different donors showed distinct levels of VEGF receptor-2, which correlated with the amount of capillary-like structures. In the case of HUASMC supportive cell layers, HUVECs detached almost completely from the surface. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Cells of different origin have a varying applicability regarding the endothelial cell co-culture assay: under the conditions described here, ovine carotid artery-derived cells seem to be more suitable than HUASMCs for an endothelial co-culture assay. Furthermore, the ovine carotid artery-derived cells are easier to obtain and are in more abundant supply than the currently used dermal or breast tissue cells. The use of ovine carotid artery-derived cells simplifies the endothelial co-culture assay with respect to testing large amounts of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Recently, the law was subject to Supreme Court review in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. A heart-wrenching case, but ICWA is far more regularly applied in abuse and neglect cases. Any involuntary removal of an American Indian child, as defined by the Act, requires the application of ICWA. While cases of voluntary adoptions designed to thwart the requirements of ICWA require constant vigilance from states and tribes, the law provides broader protections for those families in the state child welfare system. This article posits one way to both collect data about abuse and neglect compliance within the framework of ICWA, and increase that compliance through collaborative change to the systems. QUICWA, a project by the Minneapolis American Indian Center, consists of a group of interested stakeholders who have created a checklist to measure what happens in each individual hearing where the court must apply ICWA. While other groups, such as the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, use a different checklist format, the goal of the projects are similar — to find ways to increase compliance with ICWA. Funded in collaboration with Casey Family Programs, law schools and social work programs in key states have started observing ICWA hearings using the QUICWA checklist. In Michigan, the Michigan State University College of Law has observed ICWA hearings in three counties, using law students as observers. Though family law is driven by narrative, collecting data is vital to identify patterns surrounding fairness and due process in the individual stories","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In two experiments, we demonstrated that a Black male drive-by shooter’s level of phenotypic stereotypicality is accurately identified by eyewitnesses only when the victims are Black males. Specifically, when eyewitnesses believe the victims are White or female, the drive-by shooter’s level of Black phenotypic stereotypicality is falsely elevated.

We find that housing wealth, income, and mortgage rates have long-run influences on housing sales. Looking at the short run, we find that housing sales only respond to housing wealth and mortgage rates. When we distinguish the effects of financial wealth on housing sales in up-down housing markets, we note a positive influence of financial wealth on housing sales in down markets, but not in up markets.

We use logistic regression models by state to estimate the association between insurance status, race, and the likelihood of a readmission within 30 days of an index hospital admission for any cause. Overall in 5 states, non-Hispanic blacks had a slightly higher risk of 30-day readmissions relative to non-Hispanic whites, although this pattern varied by state and insurance coverage. We found higher readmission risk for non-Hispanic blacks, compared with non-Hispanic whites, among those covered by Medicare and private insurance, but lower risk among uninsured and similar risk among Medicaid. Hispanics had lower risk of readmissions relative to non-Hispanic whites, and this pattern was common across subgroups with private, Medicaid, and no insurance coverage. Uninsurance was associated with lower risk of readmissions among minorities but higher risk of readmissions among non-Hispanic whites relative to private insurance. The study found that risk of readmissions by racial ethnic groups varies by insurance status, with lower readmission rates among minorities who were uninsured compared with those with private insurance or Medicare, suggesting that lower readmission rates may not always be construed as a good outcome, because it could result from a lack of insurance coverage and poor access to care, particularly among the minorities.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Hence, the aim of RM is to periodically update the prices in response to market demands, by charging different fares to different customers for a same resource. We evaluate the effectiveness of RM and show that by segmenting customers, charging them with different pricing schemes and protecting resources for them who are willing to pay more, will result in an increase of total revenue for that resource.

We developed the MusicGlove, an instrumented glove that requires the user to practice gripping-like movements and thumb-finger opposition to play a highly engaging, music-based, video game. The purpose of this study was to 1) compare the effect of training with MusicGlove to conventional hand therapy 2) determine if MusicGlove training was more effective than a matched form of isometric hand movement training; and 3) determine if MusicGlove game scores predict clinical outcomes.Methods12 chronic stroke survivors with moderate hemiparesis were randomly assigned to receive MusicGlove, isometric, and conventional hand therapy in a within-subjects design. Each subject participated in six one-hour treatment sessions three times per week for two weeks, for each training type, for a total of 18 treatment sessions. A blinded rater assessed hand impairment before and after each training type and at one-month follow-up including the Box and Blocks (B & B) test as the primary outcome measure. Subjects also completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI).ResultsSubjects improved hand function related to grasping small objects more after MusicGlove compared to conventional training, as measured by the B & B score (improvement of 3.21±3.82 vs. -0.29±2.27 blocks; P=0.010) and the 9 Hole Peg test (improvement of 2.14±2.98 vs. -0.85±1.29 pegs/minute; P=0.005). There was no significant difference between training types in the broader assessment batteries of hand function. Subjects benefited less from isometric therapy than MusicGlove training, but the difference was not significant (P>0.09). Subjects sustained improvements in hand function at a one month follow-up, and found the MusicGlove more motivating than the other two therapies, as measured by the IMI. MusicGlove games scores correlated strongly with the B & B score.ConclusionsThese results support the hypothesis that hand therapy that is engaging, incorporates high numbers of repetitions of gripping and thumb-finger opposition movements, and promotes afferent input is a promising approach to improving an individual’s ability to manipulate small objects. The MusicGlove provides a simple way to access such therapy.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However an understanding of the use and barriers to nutrition and psychological injury prevention strategies is not currently known. This information may prove useful in the multidisciplinary environment of elite sport. Objective The objective of this study was to understand the use of exercise, nutrition and psychology injury prevention strategies, identify barriers/facilitators to implementation and preferred methods of knowledge dissemination to athletes. Design An online survey was developed based upon theories of behaviour change and injury surveillance in multi-sport event guidelines. Setting Elite (International/National standard) athletes from a variety of sports. Participants Athletes were randomly recruited from (n=50). Assessment of Risk Factors Athletes completed a questionnaire assessing risk perceptions, prevention beliefs, injury prevention strategy use, injury location/type target, outcome expectancies, barriers/facilitators to injury strategy use and current/preferred channels of information dissemination. Main Outcome Measurements Exercise, nutrition and psychology injury prevention strategy use and barriers/facilitators to strategy use. Results Preliminary findings indicate athletes did not engage with any evidence-based multi-component injury prevention programmes but the majority of athletes reported using at least one exercise-based strategy (97% of athletes) and nutrition-based strategy (97%), but fewer athletes used at least one psychology-based strategy (75%). The most common barriers reported by athletes were a lack of relative advantage for exercise-based strategies and poor how-to-knowledge, principles-knowledge and trialability particularly for nutrition and psychology-based strategies. The most common facilitators were similar across all three injury prevention strategies. These were a performance benefit, injury prevention benefit, relevance, awareness-knowledge, and usefulness. Conclusions No athletes engaged with an evidence-based injury prevention program but many used at least one exercise, nutrition or psychology injury prevention strategy. Athletes reported experiencing few barriers to exercise-based strategies but poor how-to-knowledge, principles knowledge and trialability for non-exercise based strategies.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Adequate informational privacy requires a sufficiently broad ability to give or withhold free and informed consent to proposed uses.Notice and Choice (sometimes also called “notice and consent”) is the current paradigm for consent online. The Notice is a presentation of terms, typically in a privacy policy or terms of use agreement. The Choice is an action signifying acceptance of the terms, typically clicking on an “I agree” button, or simply using the website. Recent reports by the Federal Trade Commission explicitly endorse the Notice and Choice approach (and provide guidelines for its implementation). When the Notice contains information about data collection and use, the argument for Notice and Choice rests on two claims. First: a fully adequate implementation of the paradigm would ensure that website visitors can give free and informed consent to data collection and use practices. Second: the combined effect of all the individual decisions is an acceptable overall tradeoff between privacy and the benefits of collecting and using consumers’ data. There are (we contend) decisive critiques of both claims. So why do policy makers and privacy advocates continue to endorse Notice and Choice?Most likely, they see no need to seek an alternative. We find the critique of Notice and Choice conclusive, but our assessment is far from widely shared — and understandably so. Criticisms of Notice and Choice are scattered over several articles and books. No one has unified them and answered the obvious counterarguments. We do so. Making the critique plain, however, is not enough to ensure that policy makers turn to a viable alternative. The critiques are entirely negative; they do not offer any alternative to Notice and Choice. We offer an alternative: informational norms. When appropriate informational norms govern online data collection and use, they both ensure that visitors give free and informed consent to those practices, and yield an acceptable overall tradeoff between protecting privacy and the benefits of processing information. A fundamental difficulty is the lack of norms. Rapid advances in information processing technology have fueled new business models, and the rapid development has outpaced the slow evolution of norms. Notice and Choice cannot be pressed into service to remedy this lack. It is necessary to develop new norms.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Traditionally, the benefits of an urban rail line are calculated on the basis of user benefits such as savings in travel time, vehicle operating costs, accident costs and environmental costs, and more recently wider economic benefits. An alternative approach that is sometimes used is to consider the appreciation of property prices along a rail corridor, and the intensification of land development surrounding a rail station. Using the development of new rail lines in Singapore as a case study, this paper will first apply the hedonic regression method to obtain estimates of elasticity between property price and transport accessibility. Secondly, using historical land use masterplans, the paper will discuss how the density of land use adjacent to rail stations has intensified over the past 15 years, through a comparative analysis of the land use density with respect to the distance to a rail station. Finally, with the North East Line as an example, the alternative approach comprising the land value enhancement of existing properties and the land intensification due to proximity to the line will be compared against the conventional user benefits.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To this end, this study designed and implemented a three-stage argumentation programme giving pre-service teachers (PSTs) the opportunity to consider, discuss and construct shared decisions about GMOs. The study involved 101 third-year PSTs from two different classes, randomly divided into control and experimental groups. The study utilised both quantitative and qualitative methods. During the quantitative phase, researchers administered a pre- and post-intervention scale to measure both groups’ risk perception of GMOs.

In this paper we summarise our previous work on the multi-agent-based simulation of alternative logistic concepts for city courier services. We discuss models of different organisation forms as well as the tools applied to their analysis. Since the logistic strategies analysed so far could not display the expected economic and ecologic benefits, a new concept named Fixed Exchange Points is presented that is closely related to actual work-sharing mechanisms of city couriers. We present a simulation model of this strategy and discuss first preliminary results.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We address here two main questions: (1) How do we solve the issue of the subjectivity in the evaluation of data and results, which may be particularly critical for read-across, but may have a role also for the QSAR assessment? (2) How do we take advantage of the results of both approaches to support each other? The QSAR model starts from the training set. The presence of similar chemicals with property values close to that predicted can support the result. The approach in read-across is the opposite. The assessment is focused on the few substances similar to the target. The data quality of the similar chemicals is fundamental. A risk is poor standardization in the definition of 'similarity', because different approaches may be applied. Inspired by the principles of high transparency and reproducibility, a new program for read-across, called ToxRead, has been developed and made freely available ( www.toxgate.eu ). The output of ToxRead can be compared and integrated with the output of QSAR, within a weight-of-evidence strategy. We discuss the evaluation and integration of ToxRead and QSAR with examples of the assessment of bioconcentration factors of chemicals.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Both the United States (US) and China form an intrinsic part of South Asia’s geopolitical security architecture through their embeddedness with both Pakistan and India. Historically, Pakistan relied on both American and Chinese security assistance in balancing against India while India relied more on the former Soviet Union and the US in its balancing game against Pakistan. As current geopolitical dynamics unfold with the US pivot to Asia, the rivalry and competition between the US and China is intensifying, bringing with it a similar dynamic in South Asia as Pakistan moves closer to China and India consolidates its alliance with the US. The paper concludes that, keeping current global security dynamics into perspective, the relational dynamics between Pakistan and India stands to unfold in a competitive and adversarial balance of power scenario.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It is argued that GOCs represent a distinct form of organisation and that ERP implementation strategies may need to modify some of their basic assumptions in order to be successful. The research approach used was a case study as this was seen as the most appropriate to uncovering the deeper issues which may be unique to GOCs. The study consisted of two major steps. The first step identified 31 key personal in the supply chain and these people were interviewed to determine the level of need for decision support tools prior to the implementation of a new ERP. The second step of the research involved conducting interviews with16 of the original 31 staff and this was done after the ERP had been implemented for over a year. The feasibility of improving forecasting through the use of decision support system (DSS) and the degree to which the technology can assist forecasting in the supply chain was then explored. It was discovered that data accuracy was a problem. This was not associated with the ERP implementation, but rather with social factors such as different preferences among groups of staff on how to configure procurement and payment of invoices resulting in a lack of a consistent approach across the entire GOC. A lack of trust in the ERP and ineffective training methods were also identified. This research suggests that ERP implementations within GOC's, in particular those with an extensive distributed network such as transport and electricity, are special cases and should be treated differently to implementations in other industries. Further research studies are needed to determine if ERP implementation in GOCs represent a distinct population with special requirements.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Evidence also suggests that metabolism of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor for biological methylation, is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. We investigated the effect of SAM on mtDNA density and insulin sensitivity using the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. To determine the short-term effect on mtDNA density, SAM (15 mg kg -1 d -1 ) was administered intraperitoneally for 7 d to 6 male, 57-wk-old OLETF rats and 6 Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats of the same age as a nondiabetic control. To determine the long-term effect, the same dose of SAM was administered daily to 5 male, 6-wk-old OLETF rats until the age of 25 wk; 7 control OLETF rats received vehicle and 7 LETO rats were untreated. Skeletal muscle mtDNA density was measured by either competitive or multiplex PCR and insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. SAM treatment for 1 wk increased skeletal muscle mtDNA density of both OLETF and LETO rats. The long-term SAM treatment significantly reduced body weight gain as well as increased skeletal muscle mtDNA density and whole body insulin sensitivity in OLETF rats compared with their vehicle-treated controls. Furthermore, in all 3 groups, skeletal muscle mtDNA density correlated with insulin sensitivity (r= 0.752, P < 0.001). In conclusion, SAM treatment increased mtDNA density in the skeletal muscle, improved whole body insulin sensitivity, and prevented body weight gain in OLETF rats.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Using ANCOVA, measures assessed dietary and PA self-efficacy and behaviors. Ethnically diverse participants (n=107) were included in the analyses (46% male). All students set two goals: one dietary and one PA regardless of dose. Treatment#1 resulted in similar outcomes compared to treatment#2 with no significant differences between groups.

A recent development in the field of herbal Medicine and food Additives is to counterfeit these products by adding prescription-only (Rx) active or other chemical defined ingredients which are not labeled on the packaging. As a result, customers who consume these products, thinking that they contain herbal ingredients only, are taking Rx substances without awareness about the risk of side effects.

Numerous studies have focused mainly on men, who are easier to characterize socioeconomically than women. Indeed, it has proven difficult to determine the socioeconomic position of women, and the indicators used are often inadequate �10-11�. An examination of the social health inequalities between the sexes shows that the mortality is sensitive to the inequality measure �12�, the causes of mortality differ for men and women �13-14�, these inequalities are generally less pronounced among women �11, 14-16�, and the social condition of women contributes to health discrepancies between the sexes �17-19�.

Motivation can be reinforced through public relations work. In addition to the underlying technical considerations, this paper describes the difference between communication in general and public relations and specifically examines public involvement in recycling. Through the use of examples, we look at the targeted users and typical media employed. Furthermore, we analyzes the development of public involvement. The examples show that public relations for recycling strategies relies to a great extent on attitudes, habits, and access to the target group. Thus, standardized procedures cannot be developed. For these reasons, public relation activities must be planned carefully and professionally and include an analysis of the target group, choice of media, and verification of success.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This emerging research community has yet to adequately address the new threats to the confidentiality of respondent data in spatially explicit social survey or census data files, however. This paper presents four sometimes conflicting principles for the conduct of ethical and high-quality science using such data: protection of confidentiality, the social–spatial linkage, data sharing, and data preservation. The conflict among these four principles is particularly evident in the display of spatially explicit data through maps combined with the sharing of tabular data files. This paper reviews these two research activities and shows how current practices favor one of the principles over the others and do not satisfactorily resolve the conflict among them. Maps are indispensable for the display of results but also reveal information on the location of respondents and sampling clusters that can then be used in combination with shared data files to identify respondents. The current practice of sharing modified or incomplete data sets or using data enclaves is not ideal for either the advancement of science or the protection of confidentiality. Further basic research and open debate are needed to advance both understanding of and solutions to this dilemma.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data"",""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This case study draws on interviews, historical documents, and bibliometric and patent analysis to describe the efforts of one of the longest standing US transnational campuses—Georgia Tech Lorraine—to integrate into the Lorraine region of France by adding research and economic development missions. In describing the campus’s evolution, this article highlights key markers indicating the transition to novel competencies. The results indicate that the adoption of new missions is characterized by plans, mixed success, and re-orientation rather than by a directed or designed process. Additionally, the study suggests that efforts to transplant successful programs from the home university to the Lorraine campus were less successful than those involving host region-led partnerships.","[{""country"":[""France"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The changes are to: (1) remove the Transportation Safety Administration's (TSA’s) conflict of interest by making it the policy-maker and regulator, but not the provider, of airport screening; (2) desolve screening responsibility to the airport level, under the supervision of the TSA’s Federal Security Director in each case; and (3) shift the paradigm from an equal-risk model to a genuinely risk-based model of airport security. These changes would improve airport security in many ways. They would target more of the available resources (both people and equipment) toward those passengers who pose relatively greater risk of harm, thereby getting more bang for the buck. By making all on-airport security functions the responsibility of the airport, this approach would lead to a more integrated approach, with the Federal Security Director (FSD) supervising everything.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Here, a critical overview of soft robotic grippers is presented, covering different material sets, physical principles, and device architectures. Soft gripping can be categorized into three technologies, enabling grasping by: a) actuation, b) controlled stiffness, and c) controlled adhesion. A comprehensive review of each type is presented. Compared to rigid grippers, end-effectors fabricated from flexible and soft components can often grasp or manipulate a larger variety of objects. Such grippers are an example of morphological computation, where control complexity is greatly reduced by material softness and mechanical compliance. Advanced materials and soft components, in particular silicone elastomers, shape memory materials, and active polymers and gels, are increasingly investigated for the design of lighter, simpler, and more universal grippers, using the inherent functionality of the materials. Embedding stretchable distributed sensors in or on soft grippers greatly enhances the ways in which the grippers interact with objects. Challenges for soft grippers include miniaturization, robustness, speed, integration of sensing, and control.

The influence of context on partners' contributions to the household income","Background: Female-breadwinner families represent a relatively new phenomenon in Europe. Little is known about the determinants of this couple type, which sensibly diverts from the traditional economic superiority of men within the household. Objective: This paper studies the contextual correlates of partners’ contribution to the household income, distinguishing between female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples. In particular, it focuses on the role of male unemployment rate and the prevalence of gender-egalitarian attitudes as possible explanations for the emergence of female-breadwinner and equal-income couples across European regions and countries. Methods: Using data from the fifth round (2010/2011) of the European Social Survey, integrated with data from the Eurostat database, we model the categorical variable identifying the couple type (male-breadwinner, female-breadwinner, or equal-income couple) by using a multilevel multinomial logistic regression model where individuals are nested within regions and countries. Results: The prevalence of female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples varies considerably across European countries as well as within countries. The prevalence of female-breadwinner couples is positively associated with male unemployment, while it is not influenced by the diffusion of gender-egalitarian attitudes. However, the diffusion of gender-egalitarian attitudes matters for explaining the variation in the prevalence of equal-income couples across Europe. Contribution: We add to the literature on partners’ contributions to household income by analysing the spatial distribution and the contextual correlates of female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples across European countries and regions.","[{""country"":[""Euro area"",""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The new structure is a network, facilitated by information technology, the new personnel are amateurs, who often come together in ad hoc or transitory groupings, and the new attitude an increased willingness to cause mass casualties, perhaps by using chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological (CBNR) weapons. Taken together, network organization and amateur participation suggest that the ‘new terrorists’ no longer need state sponsorship as much as their predecessors did. The impression left by accounts of the new terrorism is that it is more dangerous or at least more difficult to counter than its predecessor. Now that this view has been well developed and ably presented, it is time to assess it. Ultimately, we must ask whether what we see in terrorism today is really new and in what ways and if it poses more of a threat than the old terrorism. On balance, we will conclude that there is little that is new in the new terrorism and what is new is not necessarily more dangerous or difficult to counter than the old. The New Terrorism A good place to begin an analysis of the new terrorism is its networked structure. Terrorists are now able and willing to develop network forms of organization for the same reason that businesses are. The information revolution, by lowering the cost of communication, allows organizations to push functions outside a controlling hierarchical structure. Organizations can thus flatten out their pyramids of authority and control and approach a network form, a group of more or less autonomous, dispersed entities, linked by advanced communications and perhaps nothing more than a common purpose. Motivating or compelling the move from hierarchy to network are the advantages that an organization acquires as it transforms itself. It becomes more flexible, adaptive and resilient because each of its units senses and reacts on its own in loose coordination with the others. This multiplies the opportunities for the organization to learn, making it more flexible and adaptive. The organization becomes more resilient because if one or even several of its constituent entities are destroyed, the others carry on. A network, unlike a hierarchy, cannot be destroyed by decapitation. In the case of terrorists, the loosely linked autonomous entities that make up a network might be individuals, such as Ramzi Yousef, who organized the World Trade Center bombing, or cells such as those involved in the leaderless resistance of the","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Three types of public support encountered in various means-tested LTC schemes are examined. First, the level to be considered for means-testing only takes into account the level of wealth of the recipient without considering the cost of LTC or the possible insurance benefits. Second, the public support also considers the LTC needs of the recipient. Third, the means-test structure takes into consideration insurance benefits as well. Our results show that the optimal levels of insurance and informal care as well as their relationship are strongly influenced by the ways means-tested public support for LTC is structured, which have important implications in terms of public policy for the financing of LTC needs.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To identify monetary policy effects on wage inequality between and within firms, we exploit the interaction of nominal interest rate movements around the zero lower bound with variation in pre-determined balance sheet exposure of banks and their lending relations with firms. We find significant increases in credit supply of affected banks, leading to increased within-firm inequality. The results are driven by executives and highest- paid employees reaping relatively greater benefits from positive firm-level credit supply shocks. At the same time, low-paying firms increase their average pay in response to easier credit access.","[{""country"":[""Euro area"",""Europe & Central Asia"",""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Jane Jacobs’ thought has been of paramount importance in influencing planning and urban discourses worldwide, but she has not been isolated: in the same years, other critical voices have been shaping a critical thought and fostering debate, on both sides of the Atlantic. Among them, Paul Davidoff, appealing for advocacy planning in NYC, Giancarlo De Carlo, proposing a sharp critique of architectural and planning education in Italy and Reyner Banham and his group, advocating the (paradoxical) possibility of non-planning in the UK. This article proposes to identify a relevant common feature across their positions in the connection between epistemological and political critique; as Jane Jacobs, many critics of traditional technocratic planning underline the inappropriate and ineffective mechanisms of knowledge production and use in urban planning: if cities are characterised by organised complexity (‘intricate social and economic order under the seeming disorder of cities’, as Jacobs puts it), then it is not possible to reduce them to ‘simple problems’. These authors develop their interpretative discourses in different ways, and advance different proposals to bridge this gap, combining in original ways the epistemological dimension with a political and a cultural one.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Meanwhile, we constructed artificial islet tissue by compound culturing the pancreatic stem cells and the fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane and explored the function of artificial islets in diabetic nude mice. Methods Pancreatic stem cells were cultured on the fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane in dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing activin-A, β-catenin, and exendin-4. The differentiated pancreatic stem cells combined with modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane were implanted subcutaneously in diabetic nude mice. The function of artificial islet tissue was explored by detecting blood levels of glucose and insulin in diabetic nude mice. Moreover, the proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic stem cells on modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane as well as the changes on the tissue structure of artificial islets were investigated by immunofluorescence and haematoxylin and eosin staining. Results The pancreatic stem cells differentiated into islet-like cells and secreted insulin when cultured on fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane. Furthermore, when the artificial islet tissues were implanted into diabetic nude mice, the pancreatic stem cells combined with polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane modified by fibroblasts proliferated, differentiated, and secreted insulin to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic nude mice. Conclusion Pancreatic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into islet-like cells in vitro. In vivo, the artificial islet tissue can effectively regulate the blood glucose level in nude mice within a short period. However, as time increased, the structure of the artificial islets was destroyed due to the erosion of blood cells that resulted in the gradual loss of artificial islet function.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

One such challenge is the definition and communication of business value in large settings, where multiple development teams interact with multiple business stakeholders. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that the term business value in agile contexts is not clearly defined, even though the creation of business value is one of the central themes in agile and lean development. In this paper, we propose a model for business value that is intended to make explicit different factors that constitute the concept of business value in agile and lean software development. This model has been jointly developed with industrial partners in the Cloud Software Finland research project. We aim to further evaluate and develop the model in the future within this research project.","[{""country"":[""Finland""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Initial infection develops through ocular surface entry from droplet spread [2]. Once HSV-1 has breached the epithelial barrier of the ocular surface, it is recognized by Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), which then activate the appropriate innate immune response. Despite the high prevalence of HSV-1, only a small minority of patients develop ocular manifestations. Therefore, we hypothesized that TLR expression and activity may be deregulated in patients with HSK, which would reflect in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses observed in these patients. We investigated the effects of the TLR ligands 3, 4, 7 and 9 (as they are involved in anti-viral immune defence [3]) on cytokine induction from a patient with active HSK and compared responses of this patient to TLR ligands on a subsequent follow up visit where disease was diagnosed to be inactive.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This paper presents a new approach to quantify residential demand responsiveness to (time-of-use) TOU rates, which does not entail an econometric estimation of TOU demand equations. Based on one of the four smart grid pilots in China, our approach uses the survey data collected in 2011 from 236 residents in Yinchuan to implement a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the minimum, expected and maximum demand responsiveness to four TOU rate designs. We find that residents do not respond to TOU pricing when the TOU rate design only causes a 10% increase in their existing electricity bills under non-TOU rates. However, their estimated peak demand responsiveness is 8.41% (21.26%) when the peak-time price increases by 20% (40%). Based on these findings, we conclude that suitably designed TOU rates are useful to the efficient operation of a smart grid.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this report I focus on the GATT/WTO as the centerpiece of the post-war international trade regime, and I explore a number of themes. First, what purpose is served by the WTO and the international trade agreements that it administers? Second, in what sense is the WTO a global public good? Third, I discuss two interpretations of the developing country experience in the GATT/WTO. Fourth, I identify two potential threats to the WTO and the international trade regime that is built upon it. And finally, I consider and evaluate a number of possible reforms of the WTO. I suggest both general and specific conclusions. At a general level, I indicate the importance for the work of the Task Force with regard to the international trade regime of identifying the central inefficiencies that the WTO is being asked to address: I observe that there are two distinct inefficiencies that might reasonably be addressed through international trade agreements; and I suggest that providing its member governments with an avenue of escape from the inefficiencies that arise with a terms-of-trade driven Prisoners’ Dilemma is the central task that the WTO is well-designed to handle. Also at a general level, I argue that the global public good features of the WTO are associated primarily with its design features – that is, with the creation of the WTO and with its maintenance as a negotiating forum – rather than with the end uses to which the WTO is put by its member governments. At a more specific level, I use these general conclusions to offer two interpretations of the disappointing developing-country experience within the GATT/WTO, and to suggest that the international trade regime may be threatened by the increasing numbers of preferential trade agreements and the widening scope of non-trade issues covered by the WTO. And finally, using these general and specific conclusions, I examine a number of possible WTO reform proposals. In particular, I suggest that some of the reforms proposed for initial consideration by the Task Force are quite promising, and I attempt to point out directions in which these promising reform proposals might be further developed. *This report was written for the International Task Force on Global Public Goods to serve as background notes on the international trade regime for their second meeting to be held in Istanbul in March 2004. I thank Katell Le Goulven, members of the Task Force and Kyle Bagwell for helpful suggestions on an earlier draft.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Additionally, Law 4481/2017 introduces a notice-and-takedown procedure as a sanction to the intermediaries (access providers or hosting service providers) and website owners for online violation of intellectual property and related rights. Although it is an attempt to swiftly resolve cases of violation through the internet, the unclear relation of this sanction system to the system laid down by the Law 2121/1993 on copyright and related rights creates several inconsistencies and legal issues. At the same time, the Committee on Internet Violations of Intellectual Property (CIVIP) established to implement the notice-and-takedown procedure lacks institutional integration in the public administration structure, a situation that undermines the effectiveness of its decisions and may annul the expected benefits of the new procedure in practice.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Secondly, what would be the appropriate policy interventions to flatten Chinese emissions trajectories and reduce the risk of local, regional, and even global adversity? This research is original in its direct use of the new industrial sector-level emissions and energy using data from China to estimate the energy-specific emission effluent rate and its detailed treatment of policies taking account of the three main determinants of pollution intensity: growth, output composition, and technological change. Our results indicate that, without further effective emission control measures, China’s economic growth over the next two decades will contribute significantly to SO2 emission problems, in which the emission increase from the rapid expansion of the transportation service sectors will be the most remarkable. However, detailed examination of the structural and technological components of pollution shows that efficient pollution mitigation can be realized by focused abatement activities, cleaner production, and advances in cleaner fuel products and their use technologies.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A significant number of youth will receive a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating condition that without treatment will contribute to contemporaneous and long-term negative health consequences. Psychotherapy often has been advocated as the first line in PTSD treatments, and existing interventions have been primarily based on treating individual symptoms. Nevertheless, the deleterious effects of PTSD reverberate beyond the youth; parents, caregivers, and other social influences (e.g., romantic partners) report high levels of distress due the youth’s struggles with their symptoms or due to their own feelings of guilt, shame, or helplessness. Recognizing that social agents are a significant factor in both PTSD recovery, reduction in problematic behaviors, and caregiver stress, there is a surge of PTSD treatments that have been modified to include, either directly or indirectly, social agents. Although still in the beginning stages of development, these treatments hold much promise in treating PTSD and secondary symptoms of the child and reducing distress in others.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This work presents initial results obtained with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, which has been developed to include an accurate model of the camera response, the Poisson distribution of coincidence data and the fundamental physics of positron decay including the positron range. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Phantoms were imaged with three positron emitting isotopes of Cu ((60)Cu, (61)Cu and (64)Cu), and mice and rats were imaged with two radiopharmaceuticals labeled with these isotopes in a microPET-R4 camera. These isotopes decay by positron emission with very different end-point energies resulting in wildly different spatial resolutions. Spatial resolution improvement and image quality offered by the MAP algorithm were studied with the line source phantom and a miniature Derenzo phantom. In addition, three mice and three rats were sequentially injected over a 48-h period with Cu-pyruvaldehyde bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) (for blood flow to organs) and Cu-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-tri(methanephosphonic acid) (for bone imaging) labeled with the said three isotopes of Cu. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The line source experiment showed that comparable spatial resolution is possible with all three isotopes when using the positron range correction in MAP. The in vivo images obtained from (60)Cu and (61)Cu and reconstructed with 2D filtered back projection algorithms provided by the camera manufacturer show reduced clarity due to degraded spatial resolution arising from the extended positron ranges as compared with (64)Cu. MAP reconstructions exhibited a higher resolution with clearer organ delineation. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Inclusion of a positron range model in the MAP reconstruction algorithm may potentially result in significant resolution recovery for isotopes with larger positron ranges.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Eye-tracking is utilised at the interface between the human and the technology side of digitalisation and it is exactly at that interface, where technological innovations translate into economic values through productivity gains, increased sales, higher realised prices, improved customer satisfaction, fewer litigation cases, longer lasting customer relationships and thereby increased lifetime customer value, more profitable management decisions and improved shareholder trust. Unfortunately, numerous frictions between “machines” and humans exist at these interfaces. Over the last decades, scientists have refined methods and invented tools to detect those frictions, reflected in visual perception: eye-tracking. While the causes of these frictions are countless, eye-tracking is a single scientific method for detecting very many of them. Eye-tracking – so to speak – is “digitalisation’s best friend”. Because of the numerous applications eye-tracking provides for reducing these frictions at the human-machine interface, users pursuing a digitalisation strategy should become aware of the financial benefits by using this scientific method in their applied research and development.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To bridge the gap between detailed microscopic and simple phenomenological descriptions, a mesoscale approach, which combines an elastic network model of a machine with a particle-based mesoscale description of the solvent, is employed. The time scale of the cyclic hinge motions of the machine prototype is strongly affected by hydrodynamical coupling to the solvent.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Using original data from husbands and wives (interviewed separately) in 1,851 Tanzanian households, the analysis examines differences in the wife’s authority over 13 household and farming decisions. The study finds that the level of decision-making authority allocated to wives by their husbands, and the authority allocated by wives to themselves, both vary significantly across households. In addition to commonly considered assets such as women’s age and education, in rural agricultural households women’s health and labor activities also appear to matter for perceptions of authority. We also find husbands and wives interviewed separately frequently disagree with each other over who holds authority over key farming, family, and livelihood decisions. Further, the results of OLS and logistic regression suggest that even after controlling for various individual, household, and regional characteristics, husband and wife claims to decision-making authority continue to vary systematically by decision—suggesting that decision characteristics themselves also matter. The absence of spousal agreement over the allocation of authority (i.e., a lack of “intra-household accord”) over different farm and household decisions is problematic for interventions seeking to use survey data to develop and inform strategies for reducing gender inequalities or empowering women in rural agricultural households. Findings provide policy and program insights into when studies interviewing only a single spouse or considering only a single decision may inaccurately characterize intra-household decision-making dynamics.","[{""country"":[""Tanzania""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Up to now, the distinct structure and morphology of intact and degenerate human utricular otoconia has been only poorly investigated on vital specimen. In this study, human otoconia were obtained from the utricle in five patients undergoing translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery. Specimens were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy. Intact and degenerate otoconia as well as fracture particles of otoconia and bone were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Intact otoconia reveal a uniform size showing characteristic symmetry properties. Degenerative changes can be observed at several stages with gradual minor and major changes in their morphology including fragment formation. EDX analyses reveal the characteristic chemical composition also for otoconia remnants. XRD shows that intact and degenerate otoconia as well as remnants consist of the calcite modification. In conclusion, electron microscopy serves as a standard method for morphological investigations of otoconia. Human utricular otoconia show a uniform outer morphology corresponding to a calcite-based nanocomposite. Morphological changes provide further evidence for degeneration of utricular otoconia in humans, which might be a preconditioning factor causing BPPV. In case of uncertain origin, particles can be clearly assigned to otoconial origin using EDX and XRD analyses.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The challenge for policy makers is to provide for a level of border security that is commensurate with threats from abroad, while facilitating legitimate cross-border travel and commerce, and protecting civil liberties. To provide border security, a number of federal agencies work in tandem. The State Department and the federal inspection services, principally the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Service, have long maintained lookout books for the purpose of excluding undesirable persons, including suspected terrorists, from entry into the United States. While automated lookout books are an integral part of the border security equation, other measures can be taken to increase border security.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Geospatial Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The Psychology and Economics of Rules of Evidence - eScholarship","In civil disputes, the plaintiff must prove his case by the preponderance of the evidence. To reach this standard, the plaintiff accumulates evidence by combining facts. I compare two models of this process. Decision makers can adapt their behavior for improved results, as assumed in some psychological models. Adaptive models predict that court practice will allow the plaintiff to combine facts according to relatively simple rules. Alternatively, decision makers can optimize their behavior for best results, as assumed in most economic models. Optimization models predict that court practice will require the plaintiff to combine facts in ways that conform to the laws of probability theory. The two predictions contradict each other when simple, adaptive rules violate the laws of probability theory. I show that actual practice in a California court allows the plaintiff to combine facts according to relatively simple rules that sometimes violate the laws of probability theory. Adaptation is, consequently, a better descriptive theory than optimization. Procedures that violate the laws of probability theory, however, are vulnerable to withering criticism. Given that trials proceed with deliberate speed under expert guidance, suboptimal adaptations are irrational. Optimization, consequently, is a better normative theory than adaptation.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Rather than regarding the use of the euro by Montenegro and Kosovo as an unfortunate turn of events, the costs and benefits of unilateral adoption of the euro by not-yet member states of the region should be more openly appraised, and the option to 'euroise' recognised as a possibility. It is good that the EU has moved at the declaratory level towards visa 'liberalisation', which means scrapping visas rather than just 'facilitation' measures. However the Commission has not yet published guidelines or timelines for this. The region should be put on track for access to the Structural Funds on terms and scales progressively approaching those from which new member states such as Bulgaria and Romania already benefit. The ratio of these aid receipts between the new member states and the Western Balkans is currently 4:1; the former are receiving more than they can handle efficiently, whereas the Western Balkans have huge unsatisfied needs. Overall the case is made for significant moves towards 'functional membership' of the whole of the region with the EU, which would be a highly useful advance, irrespective of how or when the EU overcomes its Lisbon Treaty hiatus.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The latter plan would reflect both the great powers’ special responsibilities for maintaining international peace and security and the stake which lesser powers had in such a venture. In addressing these historical developments the article employs two concepts familiar to International Relations scholarship, namely concert and hierarchy. It shows how the understandings which the principal post-war planners had of these concepts – and crucially of their inter-relationship - changed over time and the consequences of these changes.

Using firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey conducted in 2013, we empirically test how innovation accentuates or mitigates the corruption obstacle. We show that innovation has a negative and statistically significant effect on the corruption obstacle. Besides, we prove that competition and the obstacle to corruption are negatively related. This result teaches that the Tunisian firms face a rent-shifting corruption.","[{""country"":[""Tunisia""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Furthermore, learners’ number of complex sentences did not have any significant relationship with L2 writing proficiency, r (40) = -.08, p > .05, but their level of mastery of complex sentences positively correlated with their writing proficiency, r (40) = .44 , p < .01 , suggesting that number of complex sentences regardless of grammaticality did not significantly correlate with L2 writing proficiency and only grammatically correct complex sentences, seen through learners’ mastery, had positive correlation with L2 writing proficiency. Furthermore, learners’ mastery of complex sentences could predict 19% of their writing proficiency, R 2 = .19 . From the results, implications and limitations of the study as well as suggestions on future studies were stated.

In Quebec, an increase in the number of severe iGASd cases has recently been observed. Because of the inter-individual variability in the severity of iGASd, a hereditary predisposition to invasive disease can be suspected. Given that iGASd occurs in MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients, although rarely, the increasing frequency of iGASd in the population of French-Canadian children may be associated with a deficiency in the host’s innate immune response. In this report, we assessed the influence of: (i) bacterial genotype and virulence factors, (ii) immune-cellular features, and (iii) Myd88/IRAK4-dependent response to GAS in vitro on the susceptibility to iGASd in a paediatric cohort of 16 children: 11 French-Canadian and 5 from diverse origin. GAS virulence factors and genotype are not implicated in the susceptibility toward iGASd, and cellular and MyD88/IRAK4 deficiencies are excluded in our patients. Although it has been shown that the MyD88/IRAK4-dependent signal is involved in the response to invasive GAS, our data indicates that a MyD88/IRAK4-mediated signalling defect is not the main factor responsible for the susceptibility to severe iGASd in a paediatric population from the province of Quebec.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Presently no official organic consumption and consumer price statistics exist at European level. However, there are manifold national approaches to get access to organic consumption data in terms of volumes and values mostly operated by private household panel approaches. The main barrier is related to a missing European approach to harmonise the different specifications and classifications which would be enable a cross country comparison of data.

With its rich heritage and attractive events, Zagreb has become a very interesting destination for tourists whose consumption habits may present the local real property owners and investors with an opportunity to invest in tourist accommodation or other tourist facilities in the city. This process will also bring inevitable societal changes to the inner city, the areas in Zagreb from which local residents depart and their homes are transformed into tourist accommodation facilities.

Psychological scientists attribute memory decline mainly to cognitive overload stemming from age-related reductions in sensory capacities, speed of cognitive processing, and the ability to filter out irrelevant information. Even in the absence of decline, however, memory is imperfect and forgetting can be especially consequential for older adults. For example, forgetting to take prescription medicines is an age-related problem largely because older adults tend to ingest many more prescription drugs. We propose that policymakers focus on increasing environmental support for memory that can reduce the burden on cognitive resources and thus improve recall.

The subjects were divided into two groups, which differed in physical training regimen and prophylaxis measures. Initial LPO steps were inhibited in both of the groups by 54–73% from day 50, while the level of SBs, which are final LPO products, decreased by 50–61% by day 230 and remained much the same up to the end of the experiment. The MDA and SB concentrations decreased by a factor of 1.6–2.3 during recovery. Total AOA decreased as an aftereffect during recovery to a level far lower than physiologically normal. Based on the significant inhibition of free-radical LPO throughout the experiment, long-term adaptation to simulated hypogravity was accompanied by a pronounced decrease in biological oxidation and caused severe stress. Substantial long-term readaptation stress developed during recovery after 370-day antiorthostatic hypokinesia, as was evident from the facts that the LPO activity was almost halved, TP concentration significantly increased, and the functional reserves of water-soluble antioxidants were exhausted. Lack of LPO activation was assumed to reflect adequate compensation in the subjects.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The author uses the leading theories and methodology of the Austrian School of Economics to review and critique the definitional construct of the term ""Economics"" as it is commonly used in the literature. The author discusses important concepts central to the nature and understanding of economics as understood by the Austrians, such as: the importance of time preference, economics as a learning system, the importance of entrepreneurialism, value determination, scarcity, the fallacy of the concept of equilibrium, human action and Praxeology, the misapplication of the scientific method and scientism to economics as a social study along with a discussion concerning the relative application of econometrics to the field of study. In doing so he touches upon the classical foundations of Austrian School, being: Methodological Individualism and Methodological Subjectivism. The author finishes his review with a look at the Theory of Subjective Value, the Theory of Diminishing Marginal Utility, The Austrian Theory of Price and lastly with a review of the Austrian Theory of the Business Trade Cycle. Through this work the author introduces the reader to the most critical thinkers behind the Austrian School of Economics: Carl Menger, Eugen Bohn-Bawerk, Ludweg von Mises and his student F. A. von Hayek (Nobel 1974). Other notable scholars being referenced include Murray Rothbard and Israel Kizner.

The Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) promotes apoptosis, and its phosphorylated form (p-FADD) mediates non-apoptotic actions. The regulation of Fas/FADD, mitochondrial apoptotic proteins and other pathways by CB receptors was investigated in the mouse brain. ::: ::: ::: EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH ::: Wild-type, CB(1) and CB(2) receptor knock-out (KO) mice were used to assess differences in receptor genotypes. CD1 mice were used to evaluate the effects of CB drugs on canonical apoptotic pathways and associated signalling systems. Target proteins were quantified by Western blot analysis. ::: ::: ::: KEY RESULTS ::: In brain regions of CB(1) receptor KO mice, Fas/FADD was reduced, but p-Ser191 FADD and the p-FADD/FADD ratio were increased. In CB(2) receptor KO mice, Fas/FADD was increased, but the p-FADD/FADD ratio was not modified. In mutant mice, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) did not indicate alterations in brain cell death. In CD1 mice, acute WIN55212-2 (CB(1) receptor agonist), but not JWH133 (CB(2) receptor agonist), inversely modulated brain FADD and p-FADD. Chronic WIN55212-2 induced FADD down-regulation and p-FADD up-regulation. Acute and chronic WIN55212-2 did not alter mitochondrial proteins or PARP cleavage. Acute, but not chronic, WIN55212-2 stimulated activation of anti-apoptotic (ERK, Akt) and pro-apoptotic (JNK, p38 kinase) pathways. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS ::: CB(1) receptors appear to exert a modest tonic activation of Fas/FADD complexes in brain. However, chronic CB(1) receptor stimulation decreased pro-apoptotic FADD and increased non-apoptotic p-FADD. The multifunctional protein FADD could participate in the mechanisms of neuroprotection induced by CBs.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Thus, it becomes important to know how much information and entertainment is required, is adequate and appropriate for a web site. The purpose of this paper is to classify 43 web sites into information and entertainment profiles. Design/methodology/approach - The sites were selected from two Indian rating web sites and engineering students. From the pool of the selected web sites, the present study classified 43 web sites on information and entertainment profiles. The web site profile comprised informativeness, organisation of information elements, entertainment properties and organisation of entertainment elements. The classification was done by three independent judges. Findings - The results revealed that out of 43 web sites, eight were high on both information and entertainment profiles, 15 were high on information and low on entertainment profiles, six were low on information and high on entertainment profiles and 14 were low on both information and entertainment profiles. Practical implications - Marketers may take cues from the classified web sites and design their web sites to ensure that the web site content meets their goals and satisfies the users while filtering out the content which is irrelevant to their business and incorporate what is essential. Originality/value - This study provides guidelines regarding the information and/or entertainment aspects which should be stronger in information and/or entertainment-oriented web sites to attract users. The present study targets the marketers who should prioritise web site features depending upon the needs of their target group.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Accordingly, the goal of this study was to measure head motion of a visually unaware ball carrier during a real game tackle to the upper trunk with no direct head contact, and compare the kinematics with previously reported concussive events. Model-Based Image-Matching was utilised to measure ball carrier head linear and angular velocities. Ball carrier componential maximum change in head angular velocities of 38.1, 20.6 and 13.5 rad/s were measured for the head local X (coronal plane), Y (sagittal plane) and Z (transverse plane) axes respectively. The combination of a high legal tackle height configuration and visually unaware ball carrier can lead to kinematics similar to average values previously reported for concussive direct head impacts.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The question addressed here is to what extent neighbourhood characteristics (percentage of rented dwellings, low-income households, and ethnic minorities in the neighbourhood) influence different categories of residents to wish to leave their neighbourhood. The answer to this question can enhance our understanding of residential mobility and of the mechanisms causing segregation by income and ethnic groups. We use data from the 2002 Netherlands Housing Demand Survey, enriched with neighbourhood characteristics. Whether or not people wish to leave their neighbourhood is estimated using a multilevel logistic regression model with cross-level interaction effects between individual and neighbourhood characteristics. The main result shows that, with an increasing percentage of people from an ethnic minority in the neighbourhood, more people have the wish to leave the neighbourhood. However, this is to a lesser extent the case for members of ethnic minorities themselves.","[{""country"":[""Netherlands""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Such trusts are legal to create but notoriously susceptible to abuse by wrongdoers seeking to hide assets from the peering eyes of tax collectors and creditors. The Panama Papers offer compelling evidence of something long suspected but difficult to prove for lack of transparency — even though asset-offshoring techniques may be used for legitimate purposes, they are, in fact, too often abused as a cover for criminal activity and tax evasion. In response to the leak, the U.S. Department of Justice and several foreign law enforcement agencies opened investigations into the financial improprieties uncovered by the Panama Papers. However, before criticizing offshore trust havens for capitalizing on fraudulent behavior at the expense of nonresident claimants, U.S. state lawmakers should first reflect upon the recent wave of domestic trust legislation authorizing similar conduct here at home. This Piece is a patriotic catharsis lamenting the recent trend of U.S. trust law to sanitize some of the most controversial and widely abused offshore trust practices and urges lawmakers to take steps toward its reversal. Three aspects of U.S. trust law, in particular, have authorized asset protection techniques similar to those permitted in offshore trust havens: (1) self-settled asset protection trusts, (2) nonresident tax shelters, and (3) trust secrecy. The Piece concludes with a discussion of existing federal law protections against domestic trust abuse and recommendations for reform.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this paper we describe our experience running an NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Computer Science and Engineering (CS&E), an area where these problems have been recently exacerbated and where under-represented minority student groups with important growth rates have had a very low participation. The most important aspects that need to be included in these programs to address these concerns and some other initiatives that can bring additional benefits at low cost are also described. For each of these aspects, successful strategies or best practices are included. Finally, the effectiveness of the program is demonstrated with the results of the program evaluation. 1. Introduction Over the last several years, the United States has witnessed alarming statistics and trends in graduate and undergraduate enrollment, graduation rates, and participation of minority groups in Science and Engineering (S&E) fields, and in Computer Science in particular. For example, according to the National Science Foundation’s Science and Engineering indicators 2006, underrepresented minorities did not enroll in or completed college at the same rate as whites. In 2003, the percentage of African Americans and Hispanics who completed ba3lor’s or higher degrees were 18% and 10%, respectively, compared with 34% of whites","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

For example, the calculation of summary measures of population health (SMPH) can be compromised if co-morbidity is not taken into account. One popular co-morbidity adjustment used in SMPH computations relies on a straightforward multiplicative combination of the severity weights for the individual conditions involved. While the convenience and simplicity of the multiplicative model are attractive, its appropriateness has yet to be formally tested. The primary objective of the current study was therefore to examine the empirical evidence in support of this approach. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The present study drew on information on the prevalence of chronic conditions and a utility-based measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), namely the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), available from Cycle 1.1 of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS; 2000-01). Average HUI3 scores were computed for both single and co-morbid conditions, and were also purified by statistically removing the loss of functional health due to health problems other than the chronic conditions reported. The co-morbidity rule was specified as a multiplicative combination of the purified average observed HUI3 utility scores for the individual conditions involved, with the addition of a synergy coefficient s for capturing any interaction between the conditions not explained by the product of their utilities. The fit of the model to the purified average observed utilities for the co-morbid conditions was optimized using ordinary least squares regression to estimate s. Replicability of the results was assessed by applying the method to triple co-morbidities from the CCHS cycle 1.1 database, as well as to double and triple co-morbidities from cycle 2.1 of the CCHS (2003-04). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Model fit was optimized at s = .99 (i.e., essentially a straightforward multiplicative model). These results were closely replicated with triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2000-01, as well as with double and triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2003-04. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The findings support the simple multiplicative model for computing utilities for co-morbid conditions from the utilities for the individual conditions involved. Future work using a wider variety of conditions and data sources could serve to further evaluate and refine the approach.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

One tactic for reducing peak loads is to increase the responsiveness of demand to changes in wholesale electricity prices. This research describes the Computer-Aided Home Energy Management (CAHEM) system, which integrates consumer preferences and real-time information about electricity prices, loads, and weather into a load-shifting algorithm that seeks an optimal tradeoff between residential electricity consumer satisfaction and peak load reduction using a rule-based fuzzy controller. We evaluate the effects of the CAHEM system on the larger power system, using PJM data from 1999, and then use the CAHEM system as the basis of a model of consumer response that we embed in a larger multi-agent simulation (MAS) of the electricity market. We focus on characteristics germane to the reliability of the transmission system, particularly price spike behavior and capacity availability and utilization. Because our fndings suggest that strategic suppliers reduce their offers in response to increased consumer price-responsiveness, we cast some doubt upon assumptions that more consumer flexibility will necessarily increase the reliability of the system as a whole.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We aimed to assess and compare geometric accuracy of preclinical scanners and examine the longitudinal stability of one scanner using a simple quality assurance (QA) protocol. Six 7 Tesla animal scanners across six different preclinical imaging centers throughout Europe were used to scan a small structural phantom and estimate linear scaling errors in all orthogonal directions and volumetric errors. Between-scanner imaging consisted of a standard sequence and each center’s preferred sequence for the assessment of infarct size in rat models of stroke. The standard sequence was also used to evaluate the drift in accuracy of the worst performing scanner over a period of six months following basic gradient calibration. Scaling and volumetric errors using the standard sequence were less variable than corresponding errors using different stroke sequences. The errors for one scanner, estimated using the standard sequence, were very high (above 4% scaling errors for each orthogonal direction, 18.73% volumetric error). Calibration of the gradient coils in this system reduced scaling errors to within ±1.0%; these remained stable during the subsequent 6-month assessment. In conclusion, despite decades of use in experimental studies, preclinical MRI still suffers from poor and variable geometric accuracy, influenced by the use of miscalibrated systems and various types of sequences for the same purpose. For effective pooling of data in multicenter studies, centers should adopt standardized procedures for system QA and in vivo imaging.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It traces the influence of particular individuals (e.g., Charles Clark in the United States, and Harry Woolf in England) in the use of empirical studies of litigation patterns and court rules to effectuate legal reforms. The essay reviews some particularly contentious issues over time, such as whether there is/was too much or too little litigation, access to courts, discovery practices, evaluations of the effects of particular rules, such as Rule 11 verification requirements, class actions, and practices such as court use of ADR, case management, and pre-trial conferences. The authors argue that empirical research on procedures and policies in courts have mostly been conducted in service of particular reform agendas, with a few exceptions of more ""pure academic"" study. The essay concludes with some suggestions for research questions that explore questions of who does the research for what purposes. Do researchers use research to develop their own ""human capital"" or legal reform influence? How do we know what optimal rates of court usage are? Can empirical studies shed light on more normative questions about what are optimal levels of process, access to courts, and when justice is delivered in formal court institutions?","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A Theory of User Entrepreneurship","A rich and distinguished body of research has documented the importance of user innovations. For the most part, this literature has found that users innovate but do not commercialize their innovations. Instead, users benefit from using their innovations and allow manufacturers to commercialize innovations with financial value. Yet scholars have recently shown that entrepreneurial activity by users is more widespread than previously believed. We present data and statistics documenting the prevalence, technological impact, and economic impact of user entrepreneurship. Then, to reconcile these divergent empirical findings, we develop a theoretical model that explains when user innovations are commercialized by users, by manufacturers, or not commercialized at all. At the core of our model is the notion that users and manufacturers differ along two critical dimensions: their estimates of the financial returns to entering the product market, and their profit thresholds. Depending upon the magnitude of these differences, we propose alternative commercialization outcomes. This model helps to explain why user entrepreneurs are likely to spawn the creation of altogether new product markets and even industries. We illustrate our model with examples from the field of consumer sporting goods. The significance of user entrepreneurship and the implications of our model for theories of innovation, entrepreneurship, and industry emergence are discussed.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Diet formulation employing a static linear programming (LP) approach, which is widely used in trading firms and feed production facilities, does not allow for intertemporal flexibility. Our approach allows the interaction between feed components over time, considering the volatile global feed prices, thereby improving sustainability in feed formulation and feed availability. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop a multi-stage LP feed model, (2) demonstrate its potential use in broiler feeding, and (3) illustrate the impact of feed input price spread (variation) on the composition of broiler diets. Modeling resulted in reciprocal relationships between conventional feeds and byproducts at different rates. Based on the price spreads expressed as a percentage of DDGS (distiller’s dried grains with solubles) price compared to corn price, three positions of dietary switch were identified; corn-DDGS price spreads of higher than 94%, between 76 and 94%, and lower than 76% corresponding to limited/no inclusion, partial inclusion, and maximum replacement of corn by DDGS, respectively. Rapeseed meal inclusion was 4, 5, and 6% in the corn-based starter, grower, and finisher diets, respectively, and its potential to replace soybean meal was limited by its higher fiber content. Based on the simulated compound feed prices, the global broiler feed industry could gain 1.7 billion USD through improved resources planning.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, there is limited data on common types of wall surfaces sprayed in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania where IRS began in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The study investigated residual efficacy of micro-encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin sprayed on common surfaces of human dwellings and domestic animal shelters in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania.MethodsAn experimental hut was constructed with different types of materials simulating common sprayable surfaces in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. Surfaces included cement plastered wall, mud-daub, white-wash, wood, palm-thatch, galvanized iron-sheets, burnt-bricks, limestone and oil-paint. The World Health Organization (WHO) procedure for IRS was used to spray lambda-cyhalothrin on surfaces at the dose of 20–25 mg/m2. Residual efficacy of insecticide was monitored through cone bioassay using laboratory-reared mosquitoes; Kisumu strain (R–70) of Anopheles gambiae ss. Cone bioassay was done every fortnight for a period of 152 days. The WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) threshold (80% mortality) was used as cut-off point for acceptable residual efficacy.ResultsA total of 5,800 mosquitoes were subjected to contact cone bioassay to test residual efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin. There was a statistically significant variation in residual efficacy between the different types of wall surfaces (r = 0.24; p < 0.001). Residual efficacy decreased with increasing pH of the substrate (r = −0.5; p < 0.001). Based on WHOPES standards, shorter residual efficacy (42-56 days) was found in wall substrates made of cement, limestone, mud-daub, oil paint and white wash. Burnt bricks retained the residual efficacy up to 134 days while galvanized iron sheets, palm thatch and wood retained the recommended residual efficacy beyond 152 days.ConclusionThe study revealed a wide variation in residual efficacy of micro encapsulated formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin across the different types of wall surfaces studied. In areas where malaria transmission is bimodal and wall surfaces with short residual efficacy comprise > 20% of sprayable structures, two rounds of IRS using lambda-cyhalothrin should be considered. Further studies are required to investigate the impact of sprayable surfaces on residual efficacy of other insecticides commonly used for IRS in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania.","[{""country"":[""Tanzania""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study surveyed school classrooms for children with special needs, and compared the performance of a sound‐field and a portable public address system in classroom environments. Unoccupied room noise levels and reverberation times were measured in eight classrooms at four Hong Kong schools for children with special needs. Speech levels in each classroom were measured under three conditions: without amplification, with public address system amplification, and with sound‐field amplification. Speech‐to‐noise ratios were calculated for each condition. Noise and unamplified speech‐to‐noise ratio values exceeded recommended acoustic standards in all classrooms. When sound‐field and public address amplification systems were installed, speech‐to‐noise ratios improved considerably. When either amplification system was used, a uniform sound‐field resulted. The applicability of both types of amplification system and their relative merits in special education classrooms are discussed.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Given the significance of identity, political elites often work to prime identities that will win over the most supporters. A large literature documents the substantial role such identity priming can play in shaping preferences, but virtually no work considers the reality that identity primes often compete with one another. That is, different groups simultaneously prime different identities that align with their interests. In this article, I explore what makes one identity prime more effective than another.

We fine-mapped the accessibility of 14 clinical scales and cognitive tests for the assessment of early childhood Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; e.g., ADOS, ADI-R, SCQ, SRS, CHAT, MESL) within 21 European countries. These tools are essential for internationally competitive early ASD detection research. We identified a considerable variation not only in the availability, but also psychometric standardization, and formal distribution of the instruments between the countries, privileging English speaking, high-income, and highly populated European countries. Absence of country-specific standardization was a problem across many countries, independent of income and size.

Although bladder-preserving surgery can be used to treat NMIBC, the rate of recurrence remains high. Intravesical chemotherapy has been shown to reduce the rate of NMIBC recurrence, and mitomycin C (MMC) has become the most commonly used intravesical cytotoxic agent. Despite the popularity of this agent in the treatment of NMIBCs, many questions regarding the optimal approach to MMC therapy remain unanswered. Strategies to enhance delivery of MMC have been well studied and multiple measures are recommended for implementation in routine clinical practice. In addition, less widely investigated techniques, such as hyperthermia and electromotive drug administration, have been shown to increase the efficacy of MMC therapy. Nevertheless, even when the current 'optimal' approaches to MMC administration are used, a large proportion of NMIBCs recur. This apparent treatment resistance might be overcome by combination of MMC with other agents that have different mechanisms of action and are unlikely to have cross-resistance. Study of the mechanisms of resistance is, therefore, important to identify key pathways underlying this phenomenon, which could be rationally targeted using specific combinations of drugs. Knowledge of these mechanisms might also reveal markers of responsiveness to therapy that could be used for patient selection.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

For storages and other technologies offering flexibilities the current regulatory framework and the market design in Germany remain a barrier for upcoming investments. In this paper regulatory barriers for an economically efficient energy storage deployment are presented and evaluated using a generic optimization model for a multifunctional operation of storage technologies on electricity markets capable to consider different market and regulatory design changes. Due to the rising significance of grid restrictions for the integration of intermittent resources and upcoming new innovative storage technologies on distribution grid level, the electricity grid was integrated into the model. Such an approach enables a quantitative analysis of interaction between market operation and grid congestion. This is shown using a 110kV high-voltage grid in the North of Germany as a representative congested grid with ongoing curtailments due to high wind energy penetration. Storage technologies — and also other measures as demand-side and generation management — will need a flexible market and a sophisticated regulatory design in order to significantly add value to the future energy system.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As more than half of the EU’s firms declare they are conducting innovation activities, RRI problems are more relevant than ever. There remain many open questions, unresolved dilemmas and empirical white spots that call for more research in this field. This paper’s focus is the problem of RRI acceptance as a global framework for responsible innovation and the scarcity of suitable instruments that may help industries understand and adopt this concept. The main contributions of this paper include critical analysis of the RRI concept and its implications for industry, proposing a concept of an RRI index for innovating enterprises.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The thrust of legislation has changed significantly on a number of occasions since 1920. The most recent legal change in the form of the Works Constitution Reform Act marks a controversial swing in favor of works council formation and authority. The present paper evaluates the new legislation from an economic perspective. We link the crucial terms of the new legislation to extant empirical evidence on the incidence of works councils, the availability of alternative employee involvement mechanisms, and the impact of the institution on performance by establishment size. Given the limitations of the evidence, which are shown to have relaxed the constraints on legislative innovation, we also offer some new empirical findings based on a matched-plants approach, using a nationally representative sample of establishments. This empirical strategy in principle offers improved estimates of the effects of works councils on establishment performance. Although the results of this exercise differ somewhat from earlier analyses, they provide little support for the recent legislative changes.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We show that the fission yeast TPP1 ortholog, Tpz1, is SUMOylated. Tpz1 SUMOylation restricts telomere elongation and promotes Stn1/Ten1 telomere association, and a SUMO-Tpz1 fusion protein has increased affinity for Stn1.

Lurking in the shadows behind any green building risk management strategy is how consequential damages should be allocated among the project stakeholders and may emanate from a party's breach of a design, construction, or consulting contract. This allocation is particularly critical on green building projects, whose unique and novel nature can create an increased potential for consequential damages. For example, green building tax credits, premium rents, and even energy savings might fall within the definition of consequential damages, creating disproportionately large liability for parties that fail to protect themselves by contract.However, guidance from the courts on exactly what might constitute green building-related consequential damages is likely years away. Only one lawsuit to date provides any relevant insight, but its applicability is broad, particularly given the pace of green building regulatory activity that continues to take place at the state and local levels. After tracing the history of consequential damages and reviewing their potential sources on green building projects, this Article reviews how major industry organizations have treated the topic in form green building contract exhibits, and suggests general risk management strategies for different green building project stakeholders who allocate the risk of consequential damages in their contracts.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Thus, to keep a healthy mitochondrial population, a balanced mitochondrial turnover must be achieved. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in various neurodegenerative disease models; however, the mechanisms involved are still incompletely characterized. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of TUDCA against mitochondrial damage triggered by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophelyhydrazone (CCCP). Herein, we show that TUDCA significantly prevents CCCP-induced cell death, ROS generation, and mitochondrial damage. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective role of TUDCA in this cell model is mediated by parkin and depends on mitophagy. The demonstration that pharmacological up-regulation of mitophagy by TUDCA prevents neurodegeneration provides new insights for the use of TUDCA as a modulator of mitochondrial activity and turnover, with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Moreover, we account for variable capital utilization i.e. the depreciation rate is endogenously determined by the degree of capital ex- ploitation. We show that under mild conditions, multiple equilibria occur. Indeed, following Grandmont, Pintus and de Vilder (JET, 1998), we can identify the necessary conditions for which the economic dynamics does change stability. In our framework, the capital utilization improves the imperfection in production sectors, resulted from the specific and aggre- gate externalities. We show that endogenous fluctuations are more likely to appear as long as the sensitivity of the capital utilization is su¢ ciently high with respect to the capital. Further, this is true for low value of elasticity of factor substitution.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The availability heuristic and the affect heuristic are key accounts of how laypeople judge risks. Yet, these two accounts have never been systematically tested against each other, nor have their predictive powers been examined across different measures of the public’s risk perception. In two studies, we gauged risk perception in student samples by employing three measures (frequency, value of a statistical life, and perceived risk) and by using a homogeneous (cancer) and a classic set of heterogeneous causes of death. Based on these judgments of risk, we tested precise models of the availability heuristic and the affect heuristic and different definitions of availability and affect. Overall, availability-by-recall, a heuristic that exploits people’s direct experience of occurrences of risks in their social network, conformed to people’s responses best. We also found direct experience to carry a high degree of ecological validity (and one that clearly surpasses that of affective information). However, the relative impact of affective information (as compared to availability) proved more pronounced in value-of-a-statistical-life and perceived-risk judgments than in riskfrequency judgments. Encounters with risks in the media, in contrast, played a negligible role in people’s judgments. Going beyond the assumption of exclusive reliance on either availability or affect, we also found evidence for mechanisms that combine both, either sequentially or in a composite fashion. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications of our results, including how to foster people’s risk calibration and the success of education campaigns.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We complement our data with an assessment of cognitive and executive function skills. First, we find that adolescent girls display significantly greater risk aversion than adolescent boys. This pattern is not observed among young children, suggesting that the gender gap in risk preferences emerges in early adolescence. Second, we find that at all ages in our study, cognitive skills (specifically math ability) are positively associated with risk taking. Executive functions among children, and soft skills among adolescents, are negatively associated with risk taking. Third, we find that greater risk-tolerance is associated with higher likelihood of disciplinary referrals, which provides evidence that our task is equipped to measure a relevant behavioral outcome. For academics, our research provides a deeper understanding of the developmental origins of risk preferences and highlights the important role of cognitive and executive function skills to better understand the association between risk preferences and cognitive abilities over the studied age range.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Controlling for other determinants of immigration both in receiving and sending countries, the analysis suggests that that the number of refugees admitted to Norway has been significantly lower during Conservative rule.Among parties with government experience, the Conservative Party also has adopted the most restrictive stand in its manifestoes.

Building on upper echelons, power, and paradox theories, we hypothesize that when a more humble CEO leads a firm, its top management team (TMT) is more likely to collaborate, share information, jointly make decisions, and possess a shared vision. The firm will also tend to have lower pay disparity between the CEO and the TMT. The humble CEO and TMT, in turn, will be more likely to adopt an ambidextrous strategic orientation, which will be associated with stronger firm performance. We tested the model by using both survey and archival data that were collected at multiple time points from 105 small-to-medium-sized firms in the computer software and hardware industry in the United States. Findings largely support our theoretical assertions, suggesting that CEO humility has important implications for firm processes and outcomes.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The addition of a second risk model can lead to just as conservative portfolios and better overall performance than one risk model alone provided that the strategy is calibrated so that both risk models affect the optimal portfolio solution. We report results using Axioma’s Japanese risk models and two risk constraints in the portfolio construction strategy. In all cases, Axioma’s daily fundamental factor Japanese risk model is the primary risk model which is used to define the tracking error of the portfolio, the primary risk constraint in the strategy. Three different second risk model constraints are considered: a) Constrain active risk using Axioma’s statistical factor risk model. b) Constrain total risk using Axioma’s statistical factor risk model. c) Constrain specific risk using Axioma’s fundamental factor risk model. Calibration of the portfolio construction parameters is essential since the region over which both risk models affect the solution is difficult to predict a priori and can be relatively narrow. In many cases, calibration results give a clear, optimum set of portfolio construction parameters in which the second risk model synergistically improves portfolio performance.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

I built a general, integrative approach to focus on both land use and livelihood functions of crop landraces in the context of nontraditional, migration-related livelihoods amid global change. The research involved a multimethod, case-study design focused on a cultural landscape of maize, i.e., corn, growing in the Andes of central Bolivia, which is a global hot spot for this crop’s agrobiodiversity. Central questions included the following: (1) What are major agroecological functions and food-related services of the agrobiodiversity of Andean maize landraces, and how are they related to cultural landscapes and associated knowledge systems? (2) What are new migration-related livelihood groups, and how are their dynamic livelihoods propelled through global change, in particular international and national migration, linked to the use and cultural landscapes of agrobiodiversity? (3) What are management and policy options derived from the previous questions? Combined social-ecological services as both cultivation and food resources are found to function in relation to the cultural landscape. Results demonstrated major variations of maturation-based, phenologic traits and food-use properties that are cornerstones of the landrace-level agrobiodiversity of Andean maize. Knowledge of these parameters is widespread. Linkage of these production and consumption functions yields a major insight into dynamics of Andean maize agrobiodiversity. Concurrently, this smallholder cultural landscape has become increasingly dependent on new rural conditions, especially increased livelihood diversification and migration amid growing peri-urban influences. Viability of landrace-level maize agrobiodiversity between 2006 and 2012 is shown to have occurred amid a transition toward the integral roles of multiple migrationrelated groups, namely women farmers, consumers, and local business owners; migrants; field caretakers; and local in-migrant laborers. The nontraditional social networks among these livelihood groups must be incorporated into analysis and planning of the design, participation, and monitoring of management and policy options for cultural landscapes ensuring the use, in situ conservation, and sustainability, including ecosystem services, of food plant landraces in global agrobiodiversity hot spots.","[{""country"":[""Bolivia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Methods: A retrospective interventional study was conducted reviewing our database for patients with a diagnosis of endophthalmitis in the course of anti-VEGF injections. Endophthalmitis diagnosis was made on clinical examination of pain, rapid decrease in visual acuity (VA), conjunctival hyperemia, hypopyon, and vitritis. In all eyes, core vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics was performed. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was performed monthly before and after surgery during follow-up. Anti-VEGF injections were continued after surgery in all cases. Results: Eight eyes with postinjection endophthalmitis were included. Mean VA immediately before endophthalmitis was 20/50 Snellen with a mean of 19 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (P = .45). At time of endophthalmitis diagnosis, mean VA was 20/1000 (range, 20/2000-20/200). Mean time from injection to when the patient noted first symptoms was 4.3 days (range, 1-8 days). Mean time from first symptoms to surgery was 12 hours (range, 2.5-26 hours). Final mean VA at the end of follow-up (range, 12-84 months) did not statistically differ from VA at the visit immediately before endophthalmitis diagnosis (P = .69). Mean frequency of injections after vitrectomy did not significantly differ from the presurgical course of treatment (P =.97). Conclusions: Anti-VEGF treatment might be continued after vitrectomy for endophthalmitis and results in satisfactory anatomical and visual outcome. Surgery did not influence the frequency of anti-VEGF injections for neovascular AMD.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To improve the specificity of PSA, a new parameter, based on the combination of free/total PSA (F/T) with PSA density, is proposed. Materials and Methods: From April 1999 to June 2003, a series of 647 men with high serum PSA levels were submitted to ultrasound-guided multiple prostate biopsies. Total PSA and free PSA were measured by immunoassay (DASIT, Italy). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of PSA density, F/T and (F/T)/PSA density (F/T divided by PSA/prostate volume) were constructed, and relative specificity and sensitivity were calculated. Results: Prostate cancer was present in 284 cases (137 of them with PSA values between 4 and 10 ng/ml), 31 patientshad intraepithelial neoplasia and the remaining cases showed benign prostatic hyperplasia. Analysis of ROC curves in all examined patients showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for (F/T)/PSA density (0.849) was significantly higher than the AUC for F/T (0.681) (p = 0.012). Similar results were observed in the cases with PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml, where the AUC for (F/T)/PSA density (0.768) was significantly higher than the AUC for F/T (0.610) (p = 0.041). In our study, the prostate cancer risk became very high when (F/T)/PSA density values decreased to <1.5. Conclusion: The use of the (F/T)/PSA density ratio may be useful in the detection of prostate cancer, reducing unnecessary prostate biopsies. A cutoff of 1.5 for the (F/T)/PSA density value is recommended for patients with PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To gain deeper insight into the applicability of the exclusion of evidence obtained through illegal means and to evaluate regulations that have been implemented, fourteen experts from different legal professions (lawyers, judges, prosecutors) and countries (Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan (ROC)) were interviewed about their experiences. All legal systems are faced with the use of illegally obtained evidence. Based on qualitatively analyzed data the frequency of the applicability of exclusionary rules, the types of cases in which they are seen, and experts’ attitudes towards the function of exclusionary rules are described. Violations of rules around the gathering of evidence is a highly sensitive topic, particularly as the state (represented by police officers and prosecutors) plays a central and powerful role. To find out if exclusionary rules do indeed result in a more impartial trial or if further protective measures are required, factors influencing the procurement of evidence and the decision-making process around the legality of such procurement were evaluated. Subsequently, difficulties that law enforcement agencies and criminal courts are faced with were outlined, with an emphasis on the application of the law and the limitations in safeguarding criminal investigations and proceedings. Concluding remarks highlight best practices in securing a fair trial as well as ancillary measures (including unwritten techniques) that may be utilized to optimize the utility of exclusionary rules.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Real Exchange Rate Dynamics in Sticky-Price Models with Capital ∗","The standard argument for abstracting from capital accumulation in sticky-price macro models is based on their short-run focus: over this horizon, capital does not move much. This argument is more problematic in the context of real exchange rate (RER) dynamics, which are very persistent. In this paper we study RER dynamics in sticky-price models with capital accumulation. We analyze both a model with an economy-wide rental market for homogeneous capital, and an economy in which capital is sector specific. We find that, in response to monetary shocks, capital increases the persistence and reduces the volatility of RERs. Nevertheless, versions of the multisector sticky-price model of Carvalho and Nechio (2011) augmented with capital accumulation can match the persistence and volatility of RERs seen in the data, irrespective of the type of capital. When comparing the implications of capital specificity, we find that, perhaps surprisingly, switching from economy-wide capital markets to sector-specific capital tends to decrease the persistence of RERs in response to monetary shocks. Finally, we study how RER dynamics are affected by monetary policy and find that the source of interest rate persistence -- policy inertia or persistent policy shocks -- is key.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, the idea remains controversial: some rail against the stereotype of the mad scientist or the crazy artist (e.g., Schlesinger, 2009, 2012), while others note higher incidences of mental illness amongst creative geniuses, including prize-winning authors, visual artists, and poets (e.g., Andreasen, 1987; Kaufman, 2000-2001; Nettle, 2006). Consistent with early ideas of a shared genetic basis (e.g., Lombroso, 1891; Galton, 1892), a growing body of research highlights a positive correlation between mental illness and heightened creativity (e.g., Rothenberg, 2001). The relationship between creativity and schizotypy warrants close examination, as greater creativity is associated with higher levels of schizotypal traits (e.g., Folley and Park, 2005). Atypical brain lateralization may play the causal role, being evident in people who are highly creative and in people who have high levels of schizotypal traits (e.g., Weinstein and Graves, 2002). This paper argues in favor of the opinion that atypical lateralization prompts a cognitive processing style that enhances both creativity and schizotypy, suggesting a potential biological foundation for the link between genius and madness.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Can the metaphorical use of verbs, as in ""he hopped on his bike and flew home"" be recognized in the same way? We investigated whether the level of abstraction of a verb's referent provides a cue that the verb is used metaphorically rather than literally. We varied level of abstraction of verb use, and obtained judgments of metaphoricity as a function of abstraction level. As with nouns, verbs that are understood at a higher level of abstraction are rated as more metaphorical than when the same verbs could be interpreted at the basic (literal) level.

Specifically, this essay argues that the proponents of traditional marriage were correct in asserting that the institution of marriage has benefits — intangible and tangible — that no other relationship currently provides to its members. Put another way, although those who defended traditional marriage were wrong with respect to their agenda, what if they in fact were absolutely right in that the marital relationship can provide something quite distinct and of great societal value? After analyzing this proposition, this essay proposes a rethinking of the privacy doctrine. What if the right to be let alone — the prior means by which the citizen is best protected by the State — is in fact more harmful than helpful?

Hybrid securities are securities that have a combination of debt and equity characteristics. The original hybrid security was preferred stock, representing ownership in a company (like equity) but having fixed payments (like bonds). Since then, companies have structured securities in many different ways. Many are structured in ways similar to debt, allowing the owner to receive a cash flow (floating or fixed) with a periodic rate of return, but also have options for conversion to equity.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We concluded that: “Recent market history also suggests the ethanol/CBOB price ratio is not likely to move above 1.0 for any length of time and that market adjustments to maintain the competitive position of ethanol are likely to be rapid. Higher ethanol production and lower ethanol prices have proven quite effective in the past at maintaining ethanol's place in gasoline blends and are likely to continue to do so in the future.” Here, we take up the topic again because crude oil and wholesale gasoline prices continued to decline through November, with crude oil prices (WTI) reaching the lowest levels in over 5 years, while ethanol prices continued to move higher. The increasing ratio of ethanol and CBOB prices has added to the uncertainty about the future of ethanol demand and perhaps contributed to the recent weakness in corn prices.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The designed questionnaire was concerned with two main points. A motivation section that tapped the students responses to two orientations related to motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic also known as integrative and instrumental. The first one is characterised by the learner's positive attitudes towards the target language group and the desire to integrate into the target language community. The second one underlies the goal to gain some social, academic or economic reward through L2 achievement which suggests a functional purpose of the target language learning. The second questionnaire section targeted the willingness and actual participation of students inside the classroom. Two variables were taken into account, the gender and the proficiency level of the subjects. Results show that almost all the respondents have an intrinsic/integrative motivation orientation, a fact that has a noticeable positive effect on their classroom participation. Other results show that while gender proved to be an influencing factor on classroom participation, the degree of students’ proficiency appeared not to have any significant effect on any of the research variables.

In order to achieve such a goal, there is a need of teachers who are devoted to school, well-trained, enhanced with creativity, and always concerned of their own educational practices. The reflection on the didactic activity becomes a necessity, an intrinsic component, in order to promote a quality education. The teacher’s reflective practice represents a conscious, assumed, responsible analysis of the didactic demarche, during and at its end, completed by informed decisions in terms of control and regulation, towards the achievement of the proposed educational objectives. At the level of the educational process, the benefits of the teacher’s reflective practice are multiple: optimization of didactic design, didactic strategy and evaluation methodology, a better acquaintance of students, improvement of the pedagogical relationship with the class, identification of appropriate ways to develop students’ competences, differentiation and individualization of training, facilitating a better understanding of the content transferred to students etc. This work aims to analyze the teachers’ opinions on the reflective practice in strong relation to their didactic activities. The method used in the investigative approach was a questionnaire-based survey - its items were focused mainly on the necessity and benefits of the reflective practice, on the frequency recorded by the teachers engaged in the reflective practice, on the supported tools, but also on the relevant stages of the reflective practice.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It argues that the dialogue fails to address the disproportionate exclusion of diverse students from the profession and the resultant lack of justice in underserved communities. The justice gap between impoverished and affluent communities in this country leaves the poor with inadequate legal representation. This gap is tied to the lack of diversity in the profession. Attorneys of color are more likely to serve clients of color and engage in public interest and public service practice. As the primary gatekeepers to the practice of law, law schools should address the disproportionate whiteness of the legal profession. If we reform legal education without reconsidering who law schools educate and who our graduates serve, we will have missed an opportunity to transform the academy and to make legal education and the legal profession more relevant and its practices more just.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

To cope with the rising public importance of sustainability is a big challenge for all animal farmers and more industrialized operations especially. Confined animal farming operations (CAFO) are seen very critical by many consumers with regard to their sustainability performance, however, the need to improve the sustainability performance especially in the ecological and social dimension exists at both ends of the intensity, i.e., also for the small holder and family owned animal farming models. As in livestock operations, feed and manure contribute the majority to the three most critical environmental impact categories global warming potential (GWP), acidification (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP) any effort for improvement should start there. Intelligent combination of nutrient-, emission- and waste management in an integrated low emission farm (LEF) concept not only significantly reduces the environmental footprint in the ecological dimension of sustainability, but by producing renewable energy (heat, electricity, biomethane) with animal manure as major feedstock in an anaerobic digester also the economic dimension can be improved. Model calculations using new software show the ecological improvement potential of low protein diets using more supplemented amino acids for the Chinese pig production. The ecological impact of producing biogas or upgraded biomethane, of further treatment of the digestate and producing defined fertilizers is discussed. Finally, the LEF concept allows the integration of an insect protein plant module which offers additional ecological and economical sustainability improvement potential in the future. Active stakeholder communication about implementation steps of LEF examples improves also the social aspect of sustainability.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

After sample fusion with Na2O2 and interference separation with ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate chelate, REE analytes were coprecipitated with Mg(OH)2 at pH 8.5, and then prepared into a water medium for CE determination. Using the standard addition method, this protocol was validated by analyses with better than 5% precision. This method was applied to geological materials; the REE results are in consistence with their certified values. With electrokinetic injection, internal standard (IS) selected among lanthanides is a prerequisite of high-quality REE data.

The panel regression technique is used to analyze the data. The analysis shows a positive relationship of dividend payout ratio with safety and profitability in banking sector of Pakistan. The study identifies a negative association of dividend payout measure with financial efficiency and risk. The results show the statistically significant association of safety, risk and profitability with dividend payout ratio. Based on these findings it is concluded that safety, risk and profitability measures are relatively strong measures for defining dividend policy. The results are strongly indicating that safer the banks, the greater payout ratio the bank has. Moreover; banks with higher profitability and lower non-performing loans (NPLs) are believed to pay more dividends.","[{""country"":[""Pakistan""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Their role is rather neglected in the Croatian academic debates on improving the quality of school system. This research intends to enhance the scientific level of their position as irreplaceable factors in a school system. The research aims to identify and illustrate the dominant model of Croatian school principals’ leadership and management carried out in 3 Slavonian counties. Furthermore, the aim is to identify which predictor variables anticipate these functions, i.e. what are the reasons for principals choosing the specific module. The sample consists of 94 school principals from both rural and urban schools. For the purpose of this research, a questionnaire composed in 3 parts with 60 statements was constructed. It includes two scales; one studying the prevalence of the traditional management models and the other studying the prevalence of the modern management models. Their reliability is satisfactory being <*=0,784 lor the traditional and a=0,833 for the modem scale. Descriptive analysis was used to identify the main characteristics of principals’ leadership and management while factor analysis was used to extract 4 components of the traditional and 4 components of the contemporary management: bureaucratization, one-sided relations with employees, meeting the external demands, objectifying employees, distributive and transformational leadership, adaptability and work autonomy. In the final phase, the robust regression was used to study the predictive value of independent variables on the resulting components of the traditional and modem management. The obtained results point out that the traditional model of management is less dominant. The impact of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sports has statistically significant predictive value (p<0,001) on two traditional management aspects. Engaging school employees in deciding about school aims has statistical significance (p<0,001) being a predictor of transformational and distributive leadership. The principals’ work experience is a predictor of work autonomy (p<0,001), while a school size predicts bureaucratization (p<0,05). The type of communication has negative predictive ability in terms of several traditional management aspects (p<0,05 and p<0,01) and positive predictive ability regarding two modem management aspects (both at p<0,001). Due to the substantial impact the aforementioned Ministry has on schools working principles, the authors suggest the decentralization measures aimed at dispersing the mentioned impact which will result in more autonomy for principals and eventually enable the development and realization of more effective educational management. In addition, it is crucial to engage employees in decision making regarding school working and development policies, modify the patterns of communication and implement specialized assistance for principals in large schools.","[{""country"":[""Croatia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Using this paradigm, in the next Part, I reframe workplaces constructed for male workers as instruments of sex discrimination. I then explain how built environments intended for the male body constitute disparate impact under Title VII.

We describe a practical qualitative method, the narrative report, and its role in evaluating implementation research. METHODS We used narrative reports as a means to evaluate an intervention to integrate pharmacists into group family practices. The pharmacists submitted 63 written narrative reports during a 1-year period. Our interdisciplinary research team analyzed these reports to monitor the progress of the implementation, to identify pharmacists' needs, and to capture elements of the integration process. RESULTS The monthly narrative reports allowed the research team to document early learning and calibrate the program in terms of clinical support, adapting roles, and realigning expectations. The reports helped the research team stay in tune with practice-related implementation challenges, and the preliminary sum- mary of narrative fi ndings provided a forum for sharing innovations among the integrating pharmacists. CONCLUSION The narrative report can be a successful qualitative tool to track and evaluate the early stages of an intervention in the context of evolving pri- mary health care teams.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

According to the theory, individuals differ in the extent to which they control their self-presentation in social interactions. Some people can observe and control their self-presentation and expressive behaviors. Besides, they are sensitive to cues indicating what expression or behavior is appropriate in any case. This sensitivity has been called „Self-Monitoring‟ skill (Snyder, 1974). In this study the effect of setting „Self-Monitoring‟ strategies during and after the Social Studies course on self-monitoring, self-regulation and academic achievement levels of the students has been investigated. In the present study, a mixed methods approach was taken, and an experimental design with pre-test and post-test and control group was used in the study. The study was carried out with three groups (two experimental groups and one control group). In the qualitative dimension of the study, the opinions of 10 classroom teachers and 20 students were gathered using Fixed Format Questionnaire. Quantitative data were analyzed using the SPSS 15 program and qualitative data were analyzed through descriptive analysis. As a result of the study, it has been observed that self-monitoring strategies used in Social Studies course had an effect on the students‟ self-monitoring and development of academic performance levels, but they had no effect on their self-regulation skills. Conducting the courses or themes such as „Me and others‟ taught in some countries in our country will help us to raise a happy, well-adjusted and productive individual. Thus, more and specific time can be devoted to raising individuals who can monitor themselves in a balanced way.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The optical load cell applied in ice monitoring systems is immune to electromagnetic interference and has no need of a power supply on site. Therefore, it has become a hot research topic in China and other countries. In this paper, to solve the problem of eccentric load in measurement, we adopt the shearing structure with additional grooves to improve the strain distribution and acquire good repeatability. Then, the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with a permanent weldable package are mounted onto the front/rear groove of the elastic element by spot welding, the direction deviation of FBGs is 90° from each other to achieve temperature compensation without an extra FBG. After that, protection parts are designed to guarantee high sensitivity for a light load condition and industrial safety under a heavy load up to 65 kN. The results of tension experiments indicate that the sensitivity and resolution of the load cell is 0.1285 pm/N and 7.782 N in the conventional measuring range (0–10 kN). Heavy load tension experiments prove that the protection structure works and the sensitivity and resolution are not changed after several high load (65 kN) cycles. In addition, the experiment shows that the resolution of the sensor is 87.79 N in the large load range, allowing the parameter to be used in heavy icing monitoring.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As a result, this study investigates the moderating effect of nominee director on the relationship between venture capitalists and their investee firms in venture cooperation.Due to this, a cross-sectional study of questionnaire survey research design was conducted.The questionnaires were distributed through mailing procedure and data was generated from 35 Malaysian venture capital companies. Overall, the findings indicate that the nominee director insignificantly influence the relationship between venture capitalists and their investees in venture cooperation. Further results show that controlling mechanism through the placement of a nominee director failed to moderate the influence of Deal Origination and Screening (DOS), Evaluating Venture Proposal (EVP), Contracting and Deal Structuring (CDS), Monitoring and Post Investment Activities (MPI) and Risk Management (RM) on the management conflict. Based on the findings, it is inferred that venture relationship between venture capitalists and their investee firms are not influenced by the nominee director placed in the investee firms' board. Thus, the study recommends that Malaysian venture capitalists, which include policy makers, to give more consideration to the controlling factor in order to reduce the possibility of conflict to occur in venture cooperation.","[{""country"":[""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Due to the size and cost limitations of banknote-counting machines and ATMs, the banknote image is usually captured by a one-dimensional (line) sensor instead of a conventional two-dimensional (area) sensor. Because the banknote image is captured by the line sensor while it is moved at fast speed through the rollers inside the banknote-counting machine or ATM, misalignment, geometric distortion, and non-uniform illumination of the captured images frequently occur, which degrades the banknote recognition accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a new method for recognizing banknotes. The experimental results using two-fold cross-validation for 61,240 United States dollar (USD) images show that the pre-classification error rate is 0%, and the average error rate for the final recognition of the USD banknotes is 0.114%.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Why do we reach such strong conclusions?The Act will relax constraints on the flow of information about “activities that undermine the security of Canada”. This is a new and astonishingly broad concept that is much more sweeping than any definition of security in Canadian national security law. In comes very close to a carte blanche, authorizing a “total information awareness” approach and a unitary view of governmental information holding and sharing. In that respect, we consider it a radical departure from conventional understandings of privacy.The proposed legislation is unbalanced because it authorizes information sharing without meaningful enhanced review. While the bill pays lip-service to accountability, it does not incorporate an accountability regime matching its scope. Even as it erodes privacy, it fails to learn from the lessons of the Arar and Iaccobucci commissions of inquiry about the injustice that may stem from poorly governed information sharing.The claims in the government’s backgrounder that the existing accountability institutions, including the Privacy Commissioner, are up to the task is not convincing to anyone familiar with the Arar report.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The method involves a pI-based fractionation using chromatofocusing in the first dimension followed by nonporous reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of each pI fraction in the second dimension. This allows fractionation of cellular proteins in the liquid phase that could then be arrayed on nitrocellulose slides and used to study humoral response in cancer. Protein microarrays have been used to identify potential serum biomarkers for prostate cancer. It is shown that specific fractions are immunoreactive against prostate cancer serum but not against serum from healthy individuals. These proteins could serve as sero-diagnostic markers for prostate cancer. Importantly, this method allows for use of post-translationally modified proteins as baits for detection of humoral response. Proteins eliciting an immune response are identified using the molecular mass and peptide sequence data obtained using mass spectrometric analysis of the liquid fractions. The fractionation of proteins in the liquid phase make this method amenable to automation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Exploring the Effects of Marijuana Dispensary Laws on Crime in California Counties","Regulated marijuana markets are more common today than outright prohibitions across the U.S. states. Advocates for policies that would legalize marijuana recreational markets frequently argue that such laws will eliminate crime associated with the black markets, which many argue is the only link between marijuana use and crime. Law enforcement, however, has consistently argued that marijuana medical dispensaries (regulated retail sale and a common method of medical marijuana distribution), create crime in neighborhoods with these store-fronts. This study offers new insight into the question by exploiting newly collected longitudinal data on local marijuana ordinances within California and thoroughly examining the extent to which counties that permit dispensaries experience changes in violent, property and marijuana use crimes using difference-in-difference methods. The results suggest no relationship between county laws that legally permit dispensaries and reported violent crime. We find a negative and significant relationship between dispensary allowances and property crime rates, although event studies indicate these effects may be a result of pre-existing trends. These results are consistent with some recent studies suggesting that dispensaries help reduce crime by reducing vacant buildings and putting more security in these areas. We also find a positive association between dispensary allowances and DUI arrests, suggesting marijuana use increases in conjunction with impaired driving in counties that adopt these ordinances, but these results are also not corroborated by an event study analysis.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Focusing on the central research question – whether US students learn effectively when left to their own devices while abroad, or whether students perform better when educators proactively intervene in their learning – the paper identifies a series of program design elements and learner characteristics that are significantly associated with gains in intercultural learning abroad. The Georgetown Consortium study provides significant evidence that most students benefit through enrolling in programs abroad that are intentionally designed to promote their intercultural learning (that is, programs that feature key design features that are strongly associated with student learning). In documenting important gender‐based learning differences (as measured by the pre‐ and post‐test Intercultural Development Inventory, the study’s male students made no more progress in their intercultural learning than did control students at campuses back in the US, while female students did show significant gains), the study also argues that focusing intentionally on learning abroad is especially important for male students.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We present a case of relapsing tumefactive demyelination in a young female patient, that posed a real diagnostic challenge, with a heterogeneous clinical picture, atypical for multiple sclerosis (MS) presentation, and neuroradiological manifestations with a high suspicion of neoplastic diseases. Case Report . An 18-year old female patient presented to our Neurosurgical Out-patients’ Clinic with symptoms atypical for multiple sclerosis, unremarkable neurological deficit, one tumefactive lesion on MRI, followed by relapse and another two lesions within a period of six months. We decided to perform biopsy of the tumefactive lesion with compressive effect. Serological and clinical data were negative for MS, and the patient did not respond well to corticosteroid therapy. Fresh frozen tumor tissue aroused a strong suspicion of gemistocytic astrocytoma, so total resection was done, but the definitive pathohistological examination confirmed tumefactive demyelination. Conclusion . For clinicians, it is important to consider demyelinating disease in the differential diagnosis of a tumorlike lesion of the central nervous system, in order to avoid invasive and potentially harmful diagnostic procedures, especially in younger patients.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The scale of the evaluation, the specific area investigated and the size of the farms are some of the potential parameters that could lead to bias and distortion during impact analysis. In addition, the current literature reveals the lack of an examination of the main qualitatively and quantitatively influenced variables. As a consequence, the depiction of policy plans and mitigation strategies able to overcome or alleviate the effects of the crisis is a difficult task. Thus, this work aimed to characterise the main effects of the economic crisis on the wine sector in a case study area (region of Tuscany— central Italy). The research focused on top and medium-small brand name capital wine farms. Potential policy actions and managerial activities to improve the local sector were depicted. Due to the multifaceted characteristics of the examined topic, the selected methodology for evaluation is a nonlinear analysis instrument. Specifically, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, network indexes and scenario analysis were adopted. Among the results, the need for association and cooperation, long-term scheduling and planning, and the capability to obtain critical funding were highlighted.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Her subclavian lymph node biopsy examination result was consistent with KD, and results of a renal biopsy indicated secondary membranous nephropathy. After renal histological examination confirmed nephropathy, treatment with prednisolone and cyclosporine was initiated, which was maintained for over 1 year. However, this therapy only provided a transient improvement in proteinuria. One year after commencing the treatment, both proteinuria and azotemia aggravated as the left axillary mass doubled in size. Finally, the mass was surgically excised, following which the azotemia rapidly normalized and proteinuria resolved within 1 month. This case shows that tumor resection in a patient with KD with secondary nephropathy may resolve secondary renal manifestations.

Deliberation occurs in groups, yet many studies of deliberation do not take the group as a unit of analysis. We argue that group composition and the attendant social dynamics to which they give rise are an important aspect of deliberation. We offer several examples of ways to study these effects, including the interaction of gender composition and the group's decision rule in the context of an experimental study of decisions about justice, the effect of racial composition in simulated juries, and the effect of ideological composition in local meetings. We examine the consequences of these factors on a variety of outcomes, including individuals' private opinion, individuals' behaviour, and group decisions. In conclusion we discuss the implications that group effects have for empirical and normative theories of deliberation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Considering that substance dependence is one of the most stigmatizing health conditions, this study aims to assess self-stigma among crack, alcohol, and both substances (crack and alcohol) dependents. The instruments used were: 1) sociodemographic questionnaire to describe participants’ characteristics; the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale adapted for substance users to assess self-stigma; 3) MINI to confirm the substance dependence diagnosis. The sample was composed by 461 patients divided into three groups: 165 alcohol dependents, 141 crack dependents, and 155 crack and alcohol dependents. Most participants were male (91.4%), unemployed (68.6%), and single (70.5%), with incomplete elementary school education (53.3%), with a mean age of 35.38 years. Regarding to involvement in illicit activities, 56.8% stated they were not involved with this type of activity. Comparing self-stigma among the groups investigated, it was found a significant difference between the groups regarding the ISMI overall scores. Similarly, ISMI subscales Alienation, Discrimination Experience, Social Withdrawal and Stigma Resistance also showed a significant difference between groups. On the other hand, the degree of agreement with stereotypes measured by the Stereotype Endorsement subscale did not differ between the groups investigated. The negatives stereotypes associated with substance dependence are equally endorsed and internalized by all groups, however this study showed evidence that crack dependents internalize more negative evaluations related to their condition, and therefore are less likely to seek treatment and adhere to it. The results pointed out the need to consider the impact of stigma on prevention and treatment strategies, in order to encourage patients to seek help and ensure the benefits of interventions.

Recent evidence indicates that innate immunity, beyond antimicrobial effectors, also relies on host-defensive mechanisms. The Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor SKN-1 regulates xenobiotic and oxidative stress responses and contributes to longevity, however, its role in immune defense is unknown. Here we show that SKN-1 is required for C. elegans pathogen resistance against both Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. Exposure to P. aeruginosa leads to SKN-1 accumulation in intestinal nuclei and transcriptional activation of two SKN-1 target genes, gcs-1 and gst-4. Both the Toll/IL-1 Receptor domain protein TIR-1 and the p38 MAPK PMK-1 are required for SKN-1 activation by PA14 exposure. We demonstrate an early onset of immunosenescence with a concomitant age-dependent decline in SKN-1-dependent target gene activation, and a requirement of SKN-1 to enhance pathogen resistance in response to longevity-promoting interventions, such as reduced insulin/IGF-like signaling and preconditioning H2O2 treatment. Finally, we find that wdr-23(RNAi)-mediated constitutive SKN-1 activation results in excessive transcription of target genes, confers oxidative stress tolerance, but impairs pathogen resistance. Our findings identify SKN-1 as a novel regulator of innate immunity, suggests its involvement in immunosenescence and provide an important crosstalk between pathogenic stress signaling and the xenobiotic/oxidative stress response.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Controlling for a variety of individual and macro-level factors, we find that individuals’ SWB varies systematically and significantly with differences in the electricity mix across countries and across time.

Meeting the needs of all stakeholders implies a trade-off of benefits and costs between supply and demand and creates transport diversity issues. However, the literature has largely ignored these issues. Transport diversity can assess the level to which important needs are satisfied equitably, and monitor whether transportation systems are moving towards sustainability by confirming the targets and basic level of quality of life. Based on the concept of transport diversity, this study utilizes fuzzy multi-objective programming to solve non-linear multi-objective problems involving urban public transit systems to determine the impact of resource allocation on needs satisfaction in relation to stakeholder behaviors. The proposed approach avoids problems of inefficient and inequitable resource allocation. A real-life case is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed methodology. Furthermore, empirical outcomes show that recent investments allocated to public transit systems considered equitable stakeholder satisfaction for both mass rapid transit (MRT) and bus, and also promoted transport diversity in the Taipei metropolitan area.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We used CGH+SNP microarray and HPV-FISH techniques for detailed screening of copy number alterations (CNAs) in a cohort of 26 patients with cervical carcinoma (CC). This approach identified CNAs in 96.2% (25/26) of tumors. Array-CGH discovered CNAs in 73.1% (19/26) of samples, HPV-FISH experiments revealed CNAs in additional 23.1% (6/26) of samples. Common gains of genetic sequences were observed in 3q (50.0%), 1q (42.4%), 19q (23.1%), while losses were frequently found in 11q (30.8%), 4q (23.1%) and 13q (19.2%). Chromosomal regions involved in loss of heterozygosity were observed in 15.4% of samples in 8q21, 11q23, 14q21 and 18q12.2. Incidence of gain 3q was associated with HPV 16 and HPV 18 positive samples and simultaneous presence of gain 1q (P = 0.033). We did not found a correlation between incidence of CNAs identified by array-CGH and HPV strain infection and incidence of lymph node metastases. Subsequently, HPV-FISH was used for validation of array-CGH results in 23 patients for incidence of hTERC (3q26) and MYC (8q24) amplification. Using HPV-FISH, we found chromosomal lesions of hTERC in 87.0% and MYC in 65.2% of specimens. Our findings confirmed the important role of HPV infection and specific genomic alterations in the development of invasive cervical cancer. This study also indicates that CGH+SNP microarrays allow detecting genome-wide CNAs and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity more precisely, however, it may be less sensitive than FISH in samples with low level clonal CNAs.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Recent advances in C–H functionalization technology have begun to transform this logic, while emphasizing the importance of and challenges associated with selective alkylation at a sp3 carbon1,2. Here we describe iron-based catalysts for the enantio-, regio- and chemoselective intermolecular alkylation of sp3 C–H bonds through carbene C–H insertion. The catalysts, derived from a cytochrome P450 enzyme in which the native cysteine axial ligand has been substituted for serine (cytochrome P411), are fully genetically encoded and produced in bacteria, where they can be tuned by directed evolution for activity and selectivity. That these proteins activate iron, the most abundant transition metal, to perform this chemistry provides a desirable alternative to noble-metal catalysts, which have dominated the field of C–H functionalization1,2. The laboratory-evolved enzymes functionalize diverse substrates containing benzylic, allylic or α-amino C–H bonds with high turnover and excellent selectivity. Furthermore, they have enabled the development of concise routes to several natural products. The use of the native iron-haem cofactor of these enzymes to mediate sp3 C–H alkylation suggests that diverse haem proteins could serve as potential catalysts for this abiological transformation, and will facilitate the development of new enzymatic C–H functionalization reactions for applications in chemistry and synthetic biology.Evolved iron-containing enzymes based on cytochrome P450 achieve selective intermolecular alkylation of sp3 C–H bonds through a carbene C–H insertion strategy.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is theorized and shown that circular- versus angular-logo shapes activate softness and hardness associations, respectively, and these concepts subsequently influence product/company attribute judgments through a resource-demanding imagery-generation process that utilizes the visuospatial sketchpad component of working memory. There are no logo shape effects on attribute judgments when the visuospatial sketchpad component of working memory is constrained by irrelevant visual imagery, when people have a lower disposition to generate imagery when processing product information, and when the headline of the ad highlights a product attribute that differs from the inference drawn from the logo shape. Further, there are shape effects even when the shape is incidentally exposed beforehand using a priming technique rather than being a part of the logo itself, demonstrating the generalizability of our findings. When taken together, the results have implications for working memory, consumer imagery, and visual marketing.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It is argued in this paper that fostering innovation in regional development is much more than a process of community consultation. Rather, what needs to be factored in is SPCC – social, political and cultural capital.

In addition, fasting insulin and glucose values were used to estimate insulinogenic indices (beta cell function) and QUICKI (insulin sensitivity). ::: ::: ::: PATIENTS ::: Six patients with known previous transient neonatal diabetes currently in remission with no exogenous insulin requirement were tested. Control data from 15 children of a similar age were available for derived fasting indices of beta cell functional capacity and insulin sensitivity. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: One child had a subnormal insulin secretory response to intravenous glucose that remained abnormal two and four years later. The other children had relatively normal or entirely normal responses over two years. Measures of beta cell function and insulin sensitivity in the fasting state showed comparable results to those obtained from normal controls. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Most children with transient neonatal diabetes in remission have no evidence of beta cell dysfunction or insulin resistance in the fasting state, although they might have been expected to show subtle defects given the tendency to relapse in adolescence. Measures of insulin response to intravenous glucose loading are often normal but suggest future recurrence if profoundly abnormal.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Most studies treat household liabilities as negative assets and relate households? decisions to their net wealth. However, the components of net wealth, i.e. financial liabilities, financial assets and real assets are very heterogeneous across households. The assumption of similar consumption behaviour among households with the same net wealth but different wealth components is implausible. This paper raises another question, namely whether households consider their indebtedness when they make decisions about their financial assets. The implication of household indebtedness for household behaviour is an important topic as household debt volumes have increased markedly in developed countries over the last three decades. There is a long list of research about household borrowing and the financial vulnerability of indebted households, but there has been less discussion about whether and how indebtedness affects households? behaviour beyond their borrowing decisions. The indebtedness has implications for households? consumption behaviour as well as for their choices regarding financial assets. There is a lack of empirical evidence on the effect of indebtedness on households? financial asset holdings in the middle of a recession. This paper sheds more light on the relationship between liabilities and financial asset holdings. The paper uses data from the recently introduced Household Finance and Consumption Sur-vey. The paper uses the first wave of the HFCS, which was implemented in 2009-2010 in 13 euro area countries. A system of equations for financial liabilities and financial assets is esti-mated while allowing for endogeneity of the two wealth components. Furthermore, selection bias issues are addressed by estimating the control equation for the selection model of debt ownership. The results suggest that households? liabilities impact households? financial assets negatively while no significant effect was found from financial assets to liabilities. The nega-tive impact of liabilities on financial assets remains after controls for the debt service burden and for saving to pay back debt are included. The results are confirmed by a large number of robustness tests. The findings provide empirical evidence for the theoretical assumption that credit markets reduce the holdings of financial assets of households. The results posit that increasing volumes of household debt are followed by lower incentives to keep financial assets. It is particularly important to understand how households? liabilities affect their other financial decisions as the penetration of debt and the volumes of debt have increased.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Learning and teaching through social media has been described as a form of participatory culture, and I expand this further by drawing upon complexity thinking to better understand the reciprocal dynamics of learning and teaching. Learning art through social media can be characterized as encounters with difference, both in ideas and contexts. Subsequently, the dynamics of attention shifts and distributes across collectives. From this, I infer a conceptualization of the art teacher as an identity that is not fixed but one that shifts throughout social media.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This paper examines whether managers strategically use financial policy when facing the risk of one such liability – litigation claims. I find that greater litigation exposure leads firms to choose higher leverage. I show that this leverage increase is brought on by an active decision to repurchase shares. These repurchases appear to be financed with a combination of excess cash and short term debt as they coincide with a significant decrease in cash holdings and an increase in short term liabilities. These firms also increase their use of operating leases, which, due to their priority in bankruptcy, have similar characteristics to secured debt. Finally, the effects seem to be stronger for firms with a higher probability of bankruptcy. These results run counter to anecdotal suggestions that firms may adjust financial policy to build a war chest in anticipation of litigation and they suggest that firms use capital structure strategically to increase shareholder value.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Sequencing and characterisation of fliC was performed in the development of a molecular serotyping technique.ResultsFliC sequencing of 106 strains revealed two groups; the g-complex included those exhibiting ""g"" or ""m,t"" antigenic factors, and the non-g strains which formed a second more diverse group. Variation in fliC was characterised and sero-specific motifs identified. Furthermore, it was possible to identify differences in certain H antigens that are not detected by traditional serotyping. A rapid short sequencing assay was developed to target serotype-specific sequence motifs in fliC. The assay was evaluated for identification of H1 antigens with a panel of 55 strains.ConclusionFliC sequences were obtained for more than 100 strains comprising 29 different H1 alleles. Unique pyrosequencing profiles corresponding to the H1 component of the serotype were generated reproducibly for the 23 alleles represented in the evaluation panel. Short read sequence assays can now be used to identify fliC alleles in approximately 97% of the 50 medically most important Salmonella in England and Wales. Capability for high throughput testing and automation give these assays considerable advantages over traditional methods.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

But many of the commonly-cited data understate retirement plan availability and participation as well as the income that retirees derive from IRA and 401(k) plans. Moreover, many observers contrast these unduly pessimistic data with a prior ""Golden Age"" of traditional pensions, when data show that most U.S. workers never participated in such plans and onerous vesting requirements prevented many from receiving substantial benefits. A perception that most Americans are falling far short of their retirement saving goals may cause policymakers to overlook targeted polices to assist the smaller number of households who truly are at risk of an inadequate income in retirement.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For a growing body of researchers, self is probably a key-concept for this enigma. The role of the cognitive self in early declarative memory as a function of perceptual manipulation between study- and test-phase was investigated. Two recall conditions were compared: either the same color props as in the modeling phase or different color props. Twenty-four 20-month-old children were observed in a 10-min deferred imitation task with two enabling sequences. An additional control group (N = 16) ensured that imitation scores did not rely on spontaneous production of the target behaviors at this age. Children in the experimental groups were classified as early or late recognizer depending on their success or failure to the mirror test. A significant interaction was observed between color props conditions and recognizer types: only late recognizers’ memory performance was affected by the perceptual manipulation. Results suggest that cognitive self could be one of the factors contributing to the differentiation between episodic and semantic subsystems in early declarative memory by the end of the second year.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Recently, however, a new debate over the attorney-client privilege has arisen in the corporate context—whether to recognize a selective waiver of the attorney-client privilege where communications have been disclosed already to one government agency but not to civil litigants or other government agencies. This debate has engendered conflicting responses from federal circuit courts, the U.S. Department of justice, the Advisory Committee on Federal Evidence Rules, and Congress. This Note argues that by adhering to the principles laid out in Upjohn, courts, lawmakers, and rulemakers should resolve the conflict in favor of recognizing a selective waiver of the attorney-client privilege.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Despite advances made in our knowledge of employment interviews, numerous ideas for future research are advanced. Three key areas that deserve immediate research attention are: (1) establishing a common model and measurement of interview structure, (2) focusing on what constructs could be or are best measured, and (3) formulating consistent definitions, labeling and measurement of applicant factors.

The purpose of this paper is to present an approach of natural language pre-processing, text mining, and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze Twitter data related to Afghanistan through a case study. Our article analyzes the Twitter English data about Afghanistan. The value of the proposed approach was to understand the most discomforts and happiness of people, their opinions, and the country situation in the different time through a case study. We found that from 29 March 2018 to 12 Jun 2018 almost always negative comments are higher than positives while from 13 Jun 2018 to 21 Jun 2018 it is just opposite, the positive comments are higher than negative comments on Twitter. The reason for this was the interim peace for a few days that had taken place between Afghan government and the Taliban terrorist group. The outcomes of this research can help the palpitations, companies, and stockholders to use social media network as a great information source for their better political strategies and better business decision-making for their current and future intentions. It provides a feasible approach and a case study as an example to assist the researchers to apply the sentiment techniques more effectively.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data"",""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Results suggest that Tier II heifers receive a premium compared with traditional Show-Me-Select heifers.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This framing exists within a literature that seeks to increase participation in environmental policymaking and democratise scientific knowledge. The constructivist approach adopted in this study analyses the discourses which permeate participatory framings and its impact on institutional design. FPI Consent is considered within a discourse of Green Radicalism against FPI Consultation within a discourse of Democratic Pragmatism. Case studies from Canada and the Philippines examine the operationalisation of the right to FPI Consent and the impacts of national norms and values. The study concludes that discourses are permeated by power inequalities and dominated by an industrial and liberal capitalist discourse, which impacts upon participatory framings and restricts the ability of more radical approaches to secure equality within deliberative forums.","[{""country"":[""Canada"",""Philippines""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The textile industry stagnated until the 1850s, grew significantly until World War I and experienced fluctuating fortunes in the 1920s and 1930s. Most activity was in the finishing of imported unbleached and bleached cotton cloth. Spinning and weaving were of marginal significance. The high labour intensity of small-scale production, the near-absence of local raw cotton production, and competitive international markets for yarn and cloth precluded domestic production. Boom-bust cycles in international markets and unfavourable real exchange rates discouraged investment in modern spinning and weaving. In the 1930s, production increased rapidly due to trade protection and technological change in small-scale weaving.","[{""country"":[""Indonesia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The study also aimed to use these SNPs to develop prediction models for individual training responses. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: 79 Healthy volunteers participated in the HIT program. A genome-wide association study, based on 2,391,739 SNPs, was performed to identify SNPs that were significantly associated with gains in V'O2max and knee peak torque, following 9 weeks of the HIT program. To predict two training responses, two independent SNPs sets were determined using linear regression and iterative binary logistic regression analysis. False discovery rate analysis and permutation tests were performed to avoid false-positive findings. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To predict gains in V'O2max, 7 SNPs were identified. These SNPs accounted for 26.0 % of the variance in the increment of V'O2max, and discriminated the subjects into three subgroups, non-responders, medium responders, and high responders, with prediction accuracy of 86.1 %. For the knee peak torque, 6 SNPs were identified, and accounted for 27.5 % of the variance in the increment of knee peak torque. The prediction accuracy discriminating the subjects into the three subgroups was estimated as 77.2 %. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Novel SNPs found in this study could explain, and predict inter-individual variability in gains of V'O2max, and knee peak torque. Furthermore, with these genetic markers, a methodology suggested in this study provides a sound approach for the personalized training program.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study focussed attention on ‘team culture’ as a moderating factor between knowledge sharing (KS) and service innovation performance (SIP). Good news for the South Africa’s hospitality sector is that respondents agree mostly positively to KS, team culture and SIP explanatory items; however, team culture (being a moderator for KS and SIP) is not very strong as depicted by the lower mean scores of team culture explanatory items compared to the mean scores of KS and SIP explanatory items. Organisational culture affects employees’ knowledge sharing attitudes and behaviours, impacting on SIP. This study therefore posits that to enhance SIP in the South Africa’s hospitality sector, strong team culture has to be supported to encourage KS among team members and between superiors and subordinates.","[{""country"":[""South Africa""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We tested the effect of soil temperature manipulation and nitrogen fertilization on EM communities in a high-altitude Pinus cembra afforestation. The trees had been inoculated in the 1960s in a nursery with a mixture of Suillus placidus, S. plorans and S. sibircus. Sampling was performed during the third year of temperature manipulation in June and October 2013. Root tips were counted, sorted into morphotypes, and sequenced. Fungal biomass was measured as ergosterol and hyphal length. The EM potential of the soil was assessed with internal transcribed spacers (ITS) clone libraries from in-growth mesh bags (MB). Temperature manipulation of ± 1 °C had no effect on the EM community. A total of 33 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, 20 from the roots, 13 from MB. The inoculated Suillus spp. colonized 82% of the root tips, thus demonstrating that the inoculation was sustainable. Nitrogen fertilization had no impact on the EM community, but promoted depletion in soil organic matter, and caused a reduction in soil fungal biomass.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Studying the role of rural institutions in determining households’ ACC is vital to developing countries like Ethiopia, where role of rural institutions are seldom recognized in official adaptation strategies. In this study, household data were collected from Kilte-Awlaelo district in order to identify and analyze the relationship among choice of adaptation strategies, household features and rural institutions. Principal component analysis and Multinomial Logit models were used for analysis. Multinomial Logit result showed that education, land size, access to irrigation, farm income, livestock ownership, access to credit were factors that significantly affected farmers’ choice of major adaptation strategy at P<0.10. Principal component index of role of rural institutions positively affected the choice of crop diversification and food storage at P<0.10 and P<0.05 respectively; while negatively affected the choice of shifting planting date as major adaptation at P<0.10. Rural institutions were found to be crucial in shaping households’ adaptation efforts. Therefore, enhancing the financial and technical capacity of rural institutions could amplify their role in facilitating ACC at household level.","[{""country"":[""Ethiopia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this essay, I analyze what determines the outsourcing activity by looking at U. S. manufacturing industries between 1972 and 2002. I concentrate on correlation between the measure of outsourcing and wages, bargaining coverage contracts, transportation costs, and private gross fixed investment in information technology. My analysis finds differences in the effects of wages on outsourcing activity depending on the type of industry (i.e., whether the industry produces durable or non-durable goods). The main regression model finds that wages and union coverage cannot fully explain the colossal increase in outsourcing activity in the last three decades. Rather, the primary factors influencing the increase in outsourcing are likely to be the growth in foreign productivity and technological changes that allow more international specialization in the intermediate production stages of the final good.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Data on HPV infection among the women with no known previous cytological abnormalities are inexistent in Austria. This study presents data on the prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes among women with no known cytological abnormalities in west Austria. Women between 18 and 65 years of age attending annual cervical cancer screening examinations were included in the study. Data on socio-demographic and reproductive factors were collected using structured questionnaires. Corresponding cervical swab samples were tested for the presence of HPV DNA and were genotyped. Questionnaire data and HPV status were linked with the corresponding cytological findings. A total of 542 women were included in the study. The mean age of the study participants was 35.9 (SD = 11.5). The prevalence of HPV infection was 20.5 %. HPV 16 (6.5 %), HPV 33 (3.3 %) and HPV 31 (3.0 %) were the dominant genotypes detected. Multivariate analysis showed that women younger than 30 years of age, smokers, women with a higher number of lifetime sexual partners and those living in the eastern districts of the study region were at significantly higher risk of HPV infection. With this study we present the first data on the prevalence of cervical HPV genotypes among a screening population in Austria. The results not only fill the missing information on HPV infection in this group of women in the country, they also provide baseline data for a future evaluation of the impact of the Austrian gender-neutral HPV immunization program. Moreover, our finding of higher HPV prevalence in the eastern compared to the western district of the study region may – at least partly – explain the east–west gradient in the standardized incidence rate of cervical cancer in the region.","[{""country"":[""Austria""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In recent years, however, while energy demand in Japan and Korea has been slowing down, it has begun to increase rapidly in ASEAN at a time when some of its own oil and gas fields are beginning to decline. The sharp rise in ASEAN's demand for energy is partly the result of massive FDI from Northeast Asia in manufacturing enterprises. This investment is enabling ASEAN to become less dependent on the export of fossil fuels for foreign exchange. Indonesia has already announced it is reducing its energy exports to Japan because it wants to use the fuel domestically. Without doubt, the other ASEAN energy exporting countries will also soon be reconsidering their energy export contracts with Northeast Asia.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Education systems, tax codes, labor laws, public polices, and cultural beliefs about motherhood and marriage all make a difference. Any accounting of ""who does what"" needs to consider the complicity of trade unions, state arrangements for children's schooling, and new cultural prescriptions for a happy marriage.

In recent years, researchers considering job stress in the workplace have made great strides in understanding several aspects of the stress phenomenon in the field of organizational behavior. Thus, it becomes more important that the coping methods of these job stresses are well explored and directly linked to individuals experiencing this situation, in order to ensure the right methods can be used for the best benefits in coping with job stresses. This research presents an integration of past research and theory that models the relationship of antecedents of job stress and coping methods among managers. The scope of this case study is limited to managerial positions in electronics firms in Malaysia. A set of demographic factors like gender, marital status and educational background, are also studied as influencing factors to job stress. The final framework in this study includes the coping variables, in which will determine the best and most suitable coping methods for managers under job stress. A proportional sampling plan will be done to cover the surveys to be covering all major locations of electronics firms in Malaysia. Theoretical and managerial implications of the study will be discussed in details. The implication of the study would be extremely beneficial for electronics organizations in not only identifying the organizational sources of job stress, but also to understand the personality behaviors of their management staffs. More importantly, this study will recommend the best coping methods for managers that would enable the leadership team in the electronics organizations to be able to handle job stress more efficiently.","[{""country"":[""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Data from 185 restaurants were collected via Internet, phone interviews, site inspections, and ZAGAT Survey, and analyzed using OLS regression. The log-linear model was found to be most suitable for the data, and the proposed hedonic model accounted for as much as 73.7% of the variation in meal prices. The results indicate that food quality and decor were important determinants of restaurants’ average meal prices while service was not. Furthermore, the study found that a restaurant's location within the building (1st floor), the types of cuisine served (Japanese and Italian), parking facilities, private dining settings, franchising, and the number of blogger reviews (e-WOM) have significant effects on restaurants’ average meal prices. The model will provide useful information for restaurateurs in deciding effective menu pricing strategies.","[{""country"":[""Korea, Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

My basic research on crystalline (proteins conferring the optical properties of the eye lens) led me down paths I never would have considered if I were conducting translational research. My investigations ranged from jellyfish to mice and resulted in the gene-sharing concept, which showed that the same protein can have distinct molecular functions depending upon its expression pattern and, conversely, that different proteins can serve similar functional roles. This essay portrays basic science as a creative narrative, comparable to literary and artistic endeavors. Preserving the autonomy of open-ended basic research and recognizing its artistic, narrative qualities will accelerate the development of innovative concepts, create a rich resource of information feeding translational research, and have a positive impact by attracting creative individuals to science.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, many antibody drugs demonstrate attributes that complicate drug development, including very poor oral bioavailability, incomplete absorption following intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, nonlinear distribution, and nonlinear elimination. In addition, antibody administration often leads to an endogenous antibody response, which may alter the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the therapeutic antibody.

Together with the GERT method, Mason's rule is applied to calculate the equivalence transfer function of the system, therefore predicting the desired outcomes. A generic eight-step process on how to implement this method in any structure of return products and remanufacturing network is provided. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the result of using GERT on forecasting printer remanufacturing outcomes.

We argue that once we examine the most compelling arguments for IT (i.e., that it encourages discovery-based, constructive learning styles), it emerges as more Socratic than it would first appear.

This is set against a consideration of the development since the 1970s of a conservative politics championing de-regulation, unfettered markets, welfare cuts and harsh law and order policies. On the one hand, this led to massively increased inequality and concentrations of wealth and political power in the hands of the super-rich, effectively placing them above the law, as the GFC revealed. On the other, a greatly enlarged, more punitive criminal justice system was directed at poor and minority communities. Explanations in terms of the rise of penal populism are helpful in explaining these developments, but it is argued they adopt a limited and reductionist view of populism, failing to see the prospects for a progressive populist politics to re-direct political attention to issues of inequality and corporate and white collar criminality.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In the blank control group, dentine surfaces were immersed in deionized water for 20 min. In the negative control group, dental surfaces were immersed in 5.25% NaOCl for 20 min. In the other nine experimental groups, after immersion for 20 min in 5.25% NaOCl, followed by PA (5%, 10%, or 15%) treatment for 1, 5 min or 10 min. The NaOCl solution was renewed every 5 min. Then dentine surfaces were bonded using SE bond. Bonded samples were sectioned into dentine-resin sticks (n = 45) for microtensile bond strength testing (MPa). Failure modes were observed and classified into three types with a stereomicroscope. Microtensile bond strength data were analysed using one-way anova. The confidence interval test was performed to analyse the recovery effect of PA on bond strength to NaOCl-treated dentine. The chi-squared test was used to analyse failure mode distribution. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: After use of 5.25% NaOCl for 20 min, microtensile bond strength in the negative control group decreased significantly compared with that of the untreated group (P < 0.05). After a recovery treatment of 10% PA for 10 min or 15% PA for more than 5 min, the bond strength was restored to at least 90% of baseline (P < 0.05). No recovery effect on bond strength was detected after the application of 5% PA for 1 min (P > 0.05). Adhesive fracture was found to be the most common failure mode in the NaOCl-treated group. After the recovery application of PA, the proportion of mixed failures increased significantly (P < 0.05). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Microtensile bond strength to NaOCl-treated dentine recovered after the application of either 5% PA for more than 5 min or 10% or 15% PA for more than 1 min. The application of PA before an adhesive procedure may immediately restore the compromised bond strength of NaOCl-treated dentine.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Data were collected through 58 interviews with stakeholders in charge of the policy; Ministers of Education and members of the Directorate of Education and Training in Norway, and the main actors such as municipality leaders, teachers, school leaders and students. Successful implementation of AfL processes was found in municipalities where there were dialogue and trust between the municipality level, school leaders, teachers and students and where the programme was adapted to the local context. Implementation was challenged when the policy was interpreted as a way of controlling the schools. Despite the successful implementation in some municipalities, the programme did not have any effect upon students’ learning outcome, as measured on national tests in reading and mathematics. The results are discussed in relation to how local assessment cultures with particular characteristics influence governing, accountability and trust.","[{""country"":[""Norway""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Supervisor ratings are subjective and data containing supervisor ratings typically stem from individual firm level data sets. For both these reasons, doubts persist on how useful such data are for evaluating theories in personnel economics and whether findings from such data generalize to the labor force at large. In this paper, we examine personnel data from six large companies and establish how subjective ratings, interpreted as ordinal rankings of employees within narrowly defined peer-groups, correlate with objective career outcomes. We find many similarities across firms in how subjective ratings correlate with earnings, base pay, bonuses, promotions, demotions, separations, quits and dismissals and cautiously propose these as empirical regularities.","[{""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Since social networks have important roles in the dissemination of information and innovation, the analysis of such networks, attracted much attention in the research area. One of the important features of social networks is community structure. So far, several methods have been proposed to detect communities, which represent the high importance of discovering communities for understanding social networks and detecting the useful and hidden patterns in the aforementioned network. However, due to extended issue of social networks and also existing the large numbers of approaches, accurate assessment of such methods are being difficult. Therefore, for survey each proposed approach in this paper, besides introducing various types of social network, suggests a classification for community detection methods based on type and nature of social networks. Using the classification presented in this paper can play an effective role in the analysis and evaluation of community detection approaches in different application domains.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","Maximum Oxygen Consumption (VO 2 max) is considered to be one of the most relevant indicators of the level of functional ability of the cardiorespiratory system in individuals and athletes. It is an indicator of the functional state and knowledge of the value of VO 2 max is of great importance in order to improve the functional form for athletes and recreational people, as well as in proper planning, programming and dosing activities. The aim of this study was to review the literature in order to determine whether physical exercise can improve VO 2 max in people with spinal cord injuries. The following electronic databases were used to collect the papers: KoBSON, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PEDro, DOAJ and Open J Gate. The key words that were used to find the papers are: physical exercise, VO 2 max, spinal cord injury, adaptation, training, effects, patients, intensity, aerobic, anaerobic, heart rate. Based on inclusive and exclusive criteria, eight papers were selected that met the set criteria. Analyzing the papers, only four papers examined the differences in terms of the intensity of the exercise with the goal of finding out which intensity is suitable for improving the VO 2 max value. They have found that the VO 2 max value can be enhanced by physical exercise of increased intensity (HIIT) relative to physical exercise of moderate intensity (LI). Considering the high level of heterogeneity of scientific papers, the sample of respondents, measuring instruments, experimental research, conclusions should be taken with caution.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Others insist that free movement of labour and services makes employment more precarious and causes wage dumping. Less attention has been given to the origins, destinations and nature of flows of posted workers, partly because data on posting are scarce. We aim to fill this gap by exploring unique posting data for Belgium. We argue that while the free movement of labour and a single European labour market have been policy goals for decades, it is the free movement of services that is shaping a hybrid single European labour market, since high levels of short-term service mobility are more significant than long-term labour migration. This is as much a phenomenon of intra-EU15 mobility as of post-accession mobility, and is set to remain more prevalent than classic free movement of labour.","[{""country"":[""Belgium""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)-IMRT versus the sequential boost (SEQ)-IMRT in HNC. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: A meta-analysis of 7 studies involving a total of 1049 patients was carried out to compare the treatment outcomes together with severe acute adverse effects of the SIB-IMRT versus the SEQ-IMRT in HNC patients. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Comparison of the SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT showed no significant difference in the measurement of overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94; 95% confidence inerval [CI], 0.70-1.27; P = .71), progression free survival (PFS) (HR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82-1.30; P = .79), locoregional recurrence free survival (LRFS) (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65-1.47; P = .91), and distance metastasis free survival (DMFS) (HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.50-1.53; P = .63). Moreover, there were no significant differences in adverse effect occurrence between the SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT groups. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT can provide comparable outcomes in the treatment of patients afflicted by HNC. Both IMRT techniques were found to carry a similar risk of severe acute adverse effect. SIB-IMRT may have advantages due to its convenience and short-course of treatment; however, the optimum fractionation and prescribed dose remained unclear. Furthermore, both IMRT techniques can be advocated as the technique of choice for HNC. Treatment plan should be individualized for patients.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Examining How Market Ownership Influences Conduct and Performance","Over the last two decades, farmers markets have been widely recognized for their contributions to local economies, support of small-scale farmers, and ability to reconnect consumers and producers of food. Farmers markets vary substantially in both the goals they set and the outcomes they achieve. By conducting a comparative analysis, this study examines whether and how market ownership influences outcomes. Additionally, our study focuses not on determining which ownership type is ""best,"" but on highlighting how markets differ, and more importantly, the limitations that need to be overcome for each type. The research uses Henry Hansmann's (1996) ownership of enterprise framework and Muhammad Yunus's (2010) social business framework to analyze whether differences in ownership lead to variations in market governance, conduct, and performance. Interviews were conducted with managers of Oregon farmers markets representing various ownership structures. Data were analyzed using the inductive thematic analysis approach to understand how ownership influences market goals and mission, general operations, and performance outcomes. The three major market ownership types, vendor-led, community-led, and subentities, have distinct benefits and challenges associated with them. Our findings indicate that vendor-led markets have strong ties back to their vendors but have weaker links to the communities that host the market and are less able to enhance the market by adding activities and pursuing additional fundraising. We found that community-led markets benefit from strong community ties and are often able to draw upon the energy and expertise of board members and volunteers. Their links back to producers depend on vendor representation on the governing body. Finally, markets that function as subentities of broader organizations have the potential for access to greater financial and managerial resources but are often relatively poorly linked to their vendors. These results provide useful insights both for those who are considering starting a market and for those who wish to improve the performance of existing markets.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

On the other hand, for certain physically realistic velocity profiles, steady flows moving only in the azimuthal direction, with no variation in this direction, are locally stable to the short-wavelength perturbations.

There is good evidence that electroencephalographic (EEG) changes are common in children with autism and these EEG changes are considered to be signs of cerebral dysfunction. ::: Aim of the work ::: The aim of this study was to study specific EEG patterns in autism and to correlate severity of autism to EEG patterns. ::: Participants and methods ::: The study was conducted on 30 children who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for autism aged 3 years and above, and 30 siblings of them not fulfilling criteria of any pervasive developmental disorder. Participants of this study were recruited from the private centers of developmentally handicapped children, and the neuropsychiatry outpatient clinic of Alexandria University Hospital. All studied children were subjected to the following: first: full history taking and physical, neurological, and psychiatric examination for clinical assessment of ASD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Second: psychological testing using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Third: EEG for all sampled children. ::: Results ::: Prevalence of EEG abnormalities among autistic cases was 66.7%, whereas in the sibling group was 20%, which was significantly different from cases group. Generalized symmetrical spike wave complexes and focal centrotemporal spikes were the most prevalent EEG changes among autistic cases. There was a significant relationship between CARS and generalized EEG abnormalities. ::: Conclusion ::: Generalized symmetrical spike wave complexes and focal centrotemporal spikes were the most prevalent EEG changes among autistic cases. The lack of similarity between cases and sibling EEGs suggests that the epileptiform activity found in children with ASDs is more than just a familial pattern or a typical childhood finding. There was a significant relationship between CARS and generalized EEG abnormalities.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This fact calls for the need to promote effective science teaching and learning in secondary schools. The purpose of this study was to examine the status of science teaching and learning, challenges facing the science learning in schools and opportunities for improvements. The study was conducted in four districts in Morogoro Region, Tanzania. Specifically, the study intended to identify the pass rates in science subjects, teachers’ professional development, science teachers’ teaching strategies, students’ level of satisfaction with the teaching and students’ readiness to take science subjects in their high schools. The study was conducted in twenty four secondary schools using a sample of 471 students and 66 teachers. The data from students and teachers were collected through a structured questionnaire and focus group discussions. The results revealed poor quality of science classroom teaching and a serious decline in interest of students in science subjects. It was therefore concluded that, teacher-students interaction and relationship in classroom teaching and learning of science need improvement. It is suggested that, future research can observe on the influence of social factors in the decline of interest in science subjects among secondary school students in Tanzania.","[{""country"":[""Africa""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, continuing artificial selection for both efficiency and rapid growth will be subject to both biological limits and animal welfare concerns. Using a novel analytical energy flow modelling approach, we predict how far such selection can go, given the biological limits of bird energy intake and partitioning of energy. We find that the biological potential for further improvements in efficiency, and hence environmental impact reduction, is minimal relative to past progress already made via artificial selection. An alternative breeding strategy to produce slower-growing birds to meet new welfare standards increases environmental burdens, compared to current birds. This unique analytic approach provides biologically sound guidelines for strategic planning of sustainable broiler production.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It can incentivize the buyers who have already joined in the auction to further diffuse the sale information to others via social relations, whereby both the seller's revenue and the social welfare can be improved. Diffusion auctions are essentially non-typical multidimensional mechanism design problems and agents' social relations are complicatedly involved with their bids. In such auctions, incentive-compatibility (IC) means it is best for every agent to honestly report her valuation and fully diffuse the sale information to all her neighbors. Existing work identified some specific mechanisms for diffusion auctions, while a general theory characterizing all incentive-compatible diffusion auctions is still missing. In this work, we identify a sufficient and necessary condition for all dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) diffusion auctions. We formulate the monotonic allocation policies in such multidimensional problems and show that any monotonic allocation policy can be implemented in a DSIC diffusion auction mechanism. Moreover, given any monotonic allocation policy, we obtain the optimal payment policy to maximize the seller's revenue.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Factors that affected the level of acceptance were the achievability of the policy, sensitivity of data being used, the specific governmental objective, and trust in the branch of government utilizing the data.

The remaining two empirical papers follow these recommendations in examining different facets of intermediary-mediated, community-based open innovation. Drawing on the Community of Practice perspective of knowledge, the second paper draws ideas from organizational behavior to examine the role of open innovation intermediaries in facilitating knowledge collaboration between client organizations and online communities. The third paper makes an additional contribution by integrating the Service-Dominant logic of marketing, to investigate what capabilities intermediaries deploy to enable clients to implement open service innovation through community-based crowdsourcing. By drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives that are under-explored within the literature, this thesis connects open innovation with external research domains, laying the foundation to advance the field toward a sturdier theoretical bent. The insights have practical implications for managers of intermediaries hoping to build client capacity in community-based open innovation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We identify gene-level associations of rare variants (with minor allele frequencies of less than 0.5%) in 4 genes at exome-wide significance, including a series of more than 30 SLC30A8 alleles that conveys protection against T2D, and in 12 gene sets, including those corresponding to T2D drug targets (P = 6.1 × 10−3) and candidate genes from knockout mice (P = 5.2 × 10−3). Within our study, the strongest T2D gene-level signals for rare variants explain at most 25% of the heritability of the strongest common single-variant signals, and the gene-level effect sizes of the rare variants that we observed in established T2D drug targets will require 75,000–185,000 sequenced cases to achieve exome-wide significance. We propose a method to interpret these modest rare-variant associations and to incorporate these associations into future target or gene prioritization efforts.Exome-sequencing analyses of a large cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes and control individuals without diabetes from five ancestries are used to identify gene-level associations of rare variants that are associated with type 2 diabetes.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Previous research show that brain areas including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and others involved in smoking addiction [1]. However it remains unclear which brain regions play a crucial role in smoking addiction and the relationship among these regions. Since functional connectivity does not support inferences about causal brain connections, the changes in information flow in these distributed systems involved in smoking remain largely unknown. Here we apply a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in resting state fMRI [2] to demonstrate the causal relationships among the core regions in smoking addiction. ::: ::: Healthy college students were recruited through campus advertisements. Among those who responded, there were 14 cigarette smokers and 14 nonsmokers. All data were collected using a 3-Telsa Siemens Skyra scanner. Functional data were processed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI, which is based on SPM (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit. Based on literature, we specified four regions of interest (ROIs) within the default mode network (DMN), which are medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and bilateral inferior parietal lobule ( Left IPL and Right IPL), same regions and coordinates as in previous studies that use sDCM analysis for resting state [2,3]. Based on SPM12, we estimated and specified the DCM for each subject and later compared the differences of effective connectivity between two groups by using two-sample test. Our results suggest the different causal relationships between nonsmokers and smokers. Specifically, there was a lower strength of excitatory input from PCC to mPFC for smokers than nonsmokers and a lower strength of excitatory input from RIPL to mPFC for smokers than nonsmokers (all p<0.05).","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This article argues that only a concept of human need can do the work required. It compares need theory with three alternative approaches. Preference satisfaction theory is criticised on the grounds of subjectivity, epistemic irrationality, endogenous and adaptive preferences, the limitlessness of wants, the absence of moral evaluation and the non-specificity of future preferences. The happiness approach is found equally wanting. The main section shows how these deficiencies can be addressed by a coherent theory of need. Human needs are necessary pre-conditions to avoid serious harm and are universalisable, objective, empirically grounded, non-substitutable and satiable. They are broader than ‘material’ needs since a need for personal autonomy figures in all theoretical accounts. Whilst needs are universal, need satisfiers are most often contextual and relative to institutions and cultures. The satiability and non-substitutability of needs is critical for understanding sustainability. Finally, it is argued that human needs provide an indispensable foundation for many current ethical arguments for global and inter-generational justice in the face of threats from climate change. An appendix compares this theory with the capability approaches of Sen and Nussbaum and argues it to be more fundamental.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The method of data collection was semi-structured interviews with Participants that were recorded concession and immediately rewritten and analyzed. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data. Data analysis resulted in three main themes including: “the influence of culture”, “prone context”, and “difficulty of quitting”. The most common reasons of increasing use of hookah in Bushehr are: “common culture of using hookah among family and friends”, “lack of enforcement of prohibiting laws about the use of hookah in public”, “lack of knowledge about hookah complications and having the wrong belief about hookah: (being less harmful than smoking)”, “desirable taste and smell of fruity hookahs” and “having no better fun” and “social stress between young people”.

Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is an appealing experimental model for correlation-based synaptic plasticity because, in contrast to plasticity induction paradigms using tetanic stimulation or sustained postsynaptic depolarization, its induction protocol more closely resembles natural physiological activity. In Xenopus tadpoles, where anatomical remodeling has been reported throughout much of the life of the animal, in vivo retinotectal STDP has only been examined under a limited set of experimental conditions. Using perforated patch recordings of retina-evoked EPSCs in tectal neurons, we confirmed that repeatedly driving a retinotectal EPSP 5-10 ms prior to inducing an action potential in the postsynaptic cell, reliably produced timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP) of the retinotectal synapse in young wild type tadpoles (stages 41-44). At these stages, retinotectal timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) also could be induced by evoking an EPSP to arrive 5-10 ms after an action potential in the tectal cell. However, retinotectal STDP using this standard protocol was limited to a developmental sensitive period, as we were unable to induce t-LTP or t-LTD after stage 44. Surprisingly, this STDP protocol also failed to induce reliable STDP in albino tadpoles at the early ages when it was effective in wild type pigmented animals. Nonetheless, low-frequency flashes to the eye produced a robust NMDA receptor-dependent retinotectal LTD in stage 47 albino tadpoles, demonstrating that the retinotectal synapse can nonetheless be modified in these animals using different plasticity paradigms.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This level of development is measured by the data of gross domestic product per inhabitant. The afore-mentioned data was selected on the basis of a hypothesis according to which the GDP per inhabitant in particular captures the ability of a given economic system to create wealth, whilst one of the fundamental prerequisites for such an ability is the general level of enforceability of a contract and therefore also the enforceability of a receivable. Insolvency proceedings as a formally demanding process based on legal specialties (usually an insolvency act) are a suitable representative of the requirement of enforceability of law. The yield for the creditor, then, is understood to be a crucial parameter of the insolvency system, for it is a natural gauge of the result of the enforcement process. Five groups of countries were formed for the purposes of comparison - the most developed European states, post-communist European states already included into the European Union, post-communist European states outside the EU, the most developed economies outside Europe and finally also oil-producing Arab states, where wealth is not necessarily proportional to the quality of enforceability of law. With the aid of regression analysis of the data, the work has proved that the quality of the legal environment measured by the efficiency of insolvency processes is truly related to the general efficiency of the economy. It is thus possible to assert on this foundation that, if we exclude states with exceptional mineral wealth, a high level of enforceability of law too is truly imperative in order to acquire wealth.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Overall, the U.S. healthcare system costs more and achieves less, per capita, than systems in other OECD nations. Opinions vary strongly, however, on the best solution to the problem. Some argue that public provision would be best able to provide universal coverage with lower prices. Others argue that only the market could ensure efficiency. The healthcare debate in the U.S. is further complicated by lobbying activity to protect existing interests. Health insurance companies argue strongly against any form of public provision, claiming such arrangements would make them unable to compete. Doctors’ organizations, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals also maneuver to ensure that any new legislation would not hurt them. Rather than build a full-scale merit comparison between the American and other industrialized countries’ approaches to healthcare, we simply argue that the U.S. adherence to private insurance does not address the goal of efficiency either with regard to the objective of the simply understood ""economic"" cost-benefit calculation, or in terms of maintaining some normatively set level of accessible care at the lowest cost. The U.S. at present defines its goals insofar as healthcare is concerned not normatively, but via the on-going political process. Currently, the central focus in this process is on cost controls rather than the extent to which politically set standards for care are met. Attempts to create legislation in the U.S. that balances political demands with efficiency are daunting and in practice generally result in sacrificing some of the goals to satisfy pressure groups. Here we approach the issue of efficiency alone, explicitly ignoring political constraints.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis in the currently largest sample of patients with sCAD, taking into account known factors influencing plasma homocysteine levels. Ninety-five patients with past sCAD were compared with 95 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. Homocysteine, vitamin B6, B12, folate, and polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T), cystathionine β-synthase (CBS 844ins68bp) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase/formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1 G1958A) were assessed and any associations were analysed using multivariate statistics. The occurrence of sCAD was associated with elevated homocysteine levels with an odds ratio of 1.327 per 20 % percentile. Homocysteine levels were influenced by gender, smoking status, occurrence of hypertension, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and by the MTHFR TT genotype. MTHFR, CBS 844ins68bp, and MTHFD1 G1958A genotype were not independently associated with the occurrence of sCAD.

Data sharing in research is widely discussed in the literature; however, there are seemingly no evidence-based incentives that promote data sharing. ::: ::: Methods: ::: A systematic review (registration: doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6PZ5E) of the health and medical research literature was used to uncover any evidence-based incentives, with pre- and post-empirical data that examined data sharing rates. We were also interested in quantifying and classifying the number of opinion pieces on the importance of incentives, the number observational studies that analysed data sharing rates and practices, and strategies aimed at increasing data sharing rates. ::: ::: Results: ::: Only one incentive (using open data badges) has been tested in health and medical research that examined data sharing rates. The number of opinion pieces (n = 85) out-weighed the number of article-testing strategies (n = 76), and the number of observational studies exceeded them both (n = 106). ::: ::: Conclusions: ::: Given that data is the foundation of evidence-based health and medical research, it is paradoxical that there is only one evidence-based incentive to promote data sharing.

Thus, a thorough understanding of inflationary episodes is critical. Using parametric hazard models, this examines the question of duration dependence of international inflationary episodes (IE) and also the influence of key covariates on the likelihood of their survival. From a sample of eleven historical high inflation episodes, fifteen recent hyperinflation cases, and forty-five international IE, the statistical evidence overall illustrates a case of positive duration dependence, indicating that IE are more likely to terminate as they grow older, and vice versa. The study's findings also suggest that variations in covariates including cumulative inflation geometric (annual) rate of inflation, and maximum (annual) inflation tend to have varying and statistically significant influence on the behavior of international IE durations. While not supporting the theoretical notion of an everincreasing inflation rate or inflation bubble, the finding of positive duration dependence in IE is not a justification for a ""laissez-faire"" policy by central banks. In fact, significant redistribution of wealth and increased inefficiency will result from IE, and thus credible monetary and fiscal reforms are fundamental for achieving economic stabilization and sustainable growth.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In other words, the issue is one of “degree of autonomy rather than an absolute autonomous state.” While autonomy has led to improvement of financial accountability for the nature and quality of services provided by commercial state corporations, the change of government funding to block grants has been accompanied by responsibility and financial accountability of state corporations, who have typically responded with more timely, detailed, and accurate financial statement. The aim of this study was to establish the level of autonomy of commercial state corporations in Kenya, in relation to their financial performance. The population of the study comprised of all commercial state corporations in Kenya, numbering thirty one. The study was descriptive in nature and a census method was used since there are only a few commercial state corporations in Kenya. Descriptive survey design was preferred because it enables the researcher to describe the area of research and explain the collected data in order to properly investigate the differences and similarities. The research instrument used to collect primary data were questionnaires through the drop and pick method. The response rate was 77% that is a total of 24 outof31 respondents obliged to the research questionnaires. Overall, it was found that autonomy increases public accountability and consumer satisfaction. Many respondents felt that autonomous state corporations, vested with greater authority were in a better position to respond to stakeholder needs. They also felt that autonomy is likely to lead to improvements in the quality of life for citizens, and that greater autonomy when accompanied by appropriate incentives, consumer responsiveness, and public accountability would lead to optimal financial performance. The findings indicated that most respondents felt that autonomy of state corporations was influenced to a large extent by political intervention and control on it business undertakings, and still to a very high extent as compared to when there was full control by the government. The research was summarized from the findings that a widely used government control on corporation is government ownership as well as resource decisions whereby the government makes decisions on hiring and firing of senior managers of these commercial state corporations. This study has revealed the effect of autonomy of financial performance in commercial state corporations in Kenya. It has investigated the level of autonomy of commercial state corporations in Kenya which identified explanatory variables which lead the explained variance in the dependent variable, the financial performance. The data collected was presented using descriptive statistics and analyzed using multivariate regressions. In the light of the research findings, the researcher recommends what needs to be done to improve the corporation’s financial performance with regards to autonomy from the government. The government should give the corporation’s the leeway to make decisions on investment and expansion as well as implementing day - today business activities. On the other hand the government should provide clear information and performance feedback, increase incentives and motivations among corporation employees. Again, the government should propose strategic direction, leadership, capacity building, reorganization and restructuring of commercial state corporations. This study will be helpful to managers and decision makers in that they will make informed decisions on the level of autonomy to adopt in their teams since the decision to grant teams or employees' autonomy is associated with costs and benefits. For example eliminating supervisory roles by shifting the organizational structure from hierarchical to horizontal could reduce costs. On the other hand, such a shift involves a sacrifice of control by management, and it is easy to imagine contexts in which this would be undesirable while putting in mind that autonomy is enhanced worker motivation. Since autonomy makes the process of financial accountability for the nature and quality of services provided by organizations stakeholders will use make the accompanied responsibility to demand for more timely, detailed and accurate financial statement from state corporations. The findings of this study are beneficial to policy makers owing to the fact that most financial performance measures of State-owned enterprises in the country have assumed a more diverse role as a result of reform programmes which have introduced greater degrees of operating management autonomy, market responsibility and profit sharing incentives at the enterprise level. This paper is important since there is witnessed changing role of accounting performance criteria in meeting the needs of operating managers of State enterprise who have an increased decision-making autonomy. At the same time the study will be helpful for practical and conceptual solutions ensuring that the needs of government corporations are maintained for financial performance criteria related to economic planning and control. The findings of this study will enrich existing knowledge and hence will be of interest to both researchers and academicians who seek to explore and carry out further investigations. It will provide basis for further research in terms of concepts, methodology and theoretical review.","[{""country"":[""Kenya""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Evaluation of these anatomic distances from 3rd and 5th lumbar vertebrae in both sides and in different body mass index (BMI) in healthy volunteers might improve knowledge of ultrasound (US) lumbar medial branch nerve blocks (LMBB). Methods: Bilateral US in the 3rd and 5th lumbar vertebrae of 64 volunteers carried out and the distance between skin to TP and skin to AP was measured. These distances were compared on both sides and in different BMI groups. The analysis was done using SPSS 11. Analysis of variance was used to compare the means at three vertebral levels (L3−L5) and different BMI groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The paired t-test was used to compare the mean distance between skin to TP and skin to AP on both sides. Results: The distance between skin to TP and skin to AP of 3rd vertebrae to 5th vertebrae was increased in both right and left sides (P ＜ 0.001) from up to down. The mean distance from skin to TP were greater on the left side compared to the right in all three vertebral levels from L3 to L5 (P values 0.014, 0.024, and 0.006 respectively).

In terms of the remedial program of physical education, this study offers an important teaching suggestion for people to avoid suffering from obesity. Centering on 1476 freshmen, people with obesity were selected from the unqualified list. Selection criteria were: Male students whose body fat exceeds 25%, with female students whose body fat exceeds 30%. In total, researchers selected 76 students (5.1%) from the unqualified list, 30 male students (39.5%) and 46 female students (60.5%), data was analyzed by adopting the Local Gray Relational Analysis (LGRA). In the case of female freshmen, the results of LGRA between body composition and each fitness sub-test showed that obesity was significantly correlated with muscular endurance and flexibility. Average weight was correlated with muscular endurance and cardiorespiratory endurance, and below average weight was correlated with flexibility and muscular endurance. On the other hand, in the case of male freshmen, the analysis revealed that obesity and average weight were significantly correlated with muscular endurance (LGRA=1 and 1, respectively), and below average weight was significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular endurance and power (LGRA=1, 0.91734872, and 0.838105731, respectively).The results could mean that different body composition of students have different strengths of fitness components. This combining psychology could specify a feasible strategy on remedial program of fitness.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Results suggest that water charges may act as an effective mechanism in inducing firms to undertake water reuse investments and in reducing intake water demand.

This paper analyses the effectiveness of the temporary assignment of needy job-seekers to private placement services by comparing their outcomes with respect to employment, unemployment and benefit receipt with those of a suitable control group. Using recently available administrative data we apply propensity score matching to construct the control group. We regard a period after a policy reform in 2005 that introduced a new means-tested benefit, the unemployment benefit II, and emphasized the activation of needy unemployed people. Hard-to-place job-seekers usually need more effort to be placed into a job. Therefore it is an interesting question whether groups of people with different a priori employment probabilities benefit to a different extent from an assignment to a private placement service. To answer this question we analyse several subgroups separated by sex, age, migration background, occupational education and time since the last job. Our results suggest that in some cases the assignment to private providers is relatively more effective for groups of job-seekers who are rather hard to place. Despite positive employment effects for some subgroups, however our results imply that the assignment to private providers is generally ineffective and in some subgroups counterproductive regarding the goal of avoiding unemployment and benefit receipt.""

Practitioner definitions of supply chain management are numerous and emphasize different aspects of firm relationships. For example, the definition may emphasize meeting the ""real needs of the end customer"" (Wisner, Leong and Tan, 2004) or it may emphasize logistics-type processes as suggested by the Supply Chain Council definition: Managing supply and demand, sourcing raw materials and parts, manufacturing and assembly, warehousing and inventory tracking, order entry and order management, distribution across all channels, and delivery to the customer (Wisner, Leong and Tan, 2004). Yet another definition (Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, 2006) emphasizes the strategic nature of supply chain across firms but does not mention the end customer: Supply Chain Management is the systemic, strategic coordination of traditional business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole. None of these definitions mentions firm performance yet supply chain management has firm performance as an implicit goal. In the academic Literature, supply chain management emphasizes both cost reduction and increased customer value (Brewer and Speh, 2000) leading to sustainable competitive advantage (Mentzer et al., 2001). More recently, a survey of supply chain professionals was undertaken in an attempt to better define supply chain management (Gibson, Mentzer, and Cook, 2005). Yet even this most recent work suggests that ""only time wiU teU if it [CSCMP definition] becomes the consensus definition of SCM."" Perhaps because of lack of a consensus definition and a lack of consistent management understanding, there remains a question of the connection between a high-performing supply chain and individual company performance. The lack of adequate understanding is likely due to the multifaceted and complex nature of supply chain relationships and the lack of firm-spanning metrics with which to measure these relationships. Cooper, Lambert, and Pagh (1997) suggest a conceptual supply chain framework consisting of business processes, management components, and supply chain structure and further suggest how to operationalize the framework using case studies (Lambert, Cooper, and Pagh, 1998). While managing the supply chain from point of origin to point of consumption is indeed a difficult task, the introduction of technology that improves information flow may help with firm integration across the supply chain (Walton and Miller, 1995). Further, many executives believe that profitability could increase if key business processes are linked and managed across multiple companies (Lambert, Cooper, and Pagh, 1998). The present research explores the importance of business processes, including customer service, business process documentation and measurement and management components such as accurate information exchange to firm performance using data collected from an online survey of high-level supply chain managers. The remainder of this work is organized as follows. First, the supply chain literature is briefly reviewed before describing the methodology. Next, the results are presented followed by a discussion of the managerial implications and recommendations for future research. LITERATURE REVIEW Business process documentation and measurement is found to vary with the importance of the process to the focal companies (Lambert, Cooper, and Pagh, 1998).

The objective of this research was to determine the stability of K3EDTA-plasma and serum on different storage conditions. ::: ::: ::: Materials and methods ::: A total of thirty healthy adults were studied. The serum/plasma samples were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes. Immediately after centrifugation, the serum/plasma analytes were assayed in primary tubes using a Cobas c501 analyzer (T0); the residual serum/plasma was stored at either 2-8°C or -20°C for 15 (T15) and 30 days (T30).Mean concentrations changes in respect of initial concentrations (T0) and the reference change values were calculated. For assessing statistical difference between samples, the Wilcoxon ranked-pairs test was applied. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: We evidenced instability for total bilirubin, uric acid, creatinine and glucose at T15 and T30 and stored at -20°C (p<0.05). However, potential clinical impact significance were observed only for total bilirrubin T30 at -20°C, and creatinine T30 at 2-8°C. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Our results had shown that storage samples at -20°C is a better way to preserve glucose, creatinine, and uric acid. Therefore, laboratories should freeze their samples as soon as possible to guarantee proper stability when there is need to repeat analysis, verify a result, or add a laboratory testing.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The detrimental effect of uncertainty on hiring is more pronounced when firms face greater firing and replacement costs and when they face less direct competition from other similar firms.

The decomposition process of these subsidised resources can be influenced by increasing consumer abundance. However, few studies have assessed whether resource subsidies can promote resource decomposition via a population increase in consumers. Here, we examined the effects of keratin subsidies on feather decomposition in egret and heron breeding colonies. Egrets and herons (Ardeidae) frequently breed in inland forests and provide large amounts of keratin materials to the forest floor in the form of feathers of chicks (that die). We compared the decrease in the weights of egret and heron feathers (experimentally placed on the forest floor) over a 12-month period among egret/heron breeding colonies (five sites) and areas outside of colonies (five sites) in central Japan. Of the feathers placed experimentally on forest floors, 92-97 % and 99-100 % in colonies and 47-50 % and 71-90 % in non-colony areas were decomposed after 4 and 12 months, respectively. Then, decomposition rates of feathers were faster in colonies than in areas outside of colonies, suggesting that keratin subsidies can promote feather decomposition in colonies. Field observations and laboratory experiments indicated that keratin-feeding arthropods and keratinophilic fungi played important roles in feather decomposition. Therefore, scavenging arthropods and keratinophilic fungi, which dramatically increased in egret and heron breeding colonies, could accelerate the decomposition of feathers supplied to the forest floor of colonies.","[{""country"":[""Japan""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Using a convenient sample survey and a series of corporate stories we examine the options for turnaround strategies and the patterns of strategic choice. We find that economic recession provoked the 'return' of company owners to the role of 'internal strategists' or even into operations management. Under such conditions companies with dispersed ownership have visible disadvantages in building a consistent strategic agenda and timely implementation of robust strategies, as any strategic actions largely depend on a 'concert' of corporate strategists. Factor analysis of the actions implemented or planned for implementation reveals two patterns of strategic behaviour - cost leadership and differentiation. Cost leadership is the more popular option as it provides more chances for sustainability in the short term. The selection between the two strategic options is less determined by the company's past performance and competitiveness than by ambitions of key 'internal strategists'.","[{""country"":[""Russian Federation""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The molecular basis of neuromodulation by extracellular protons is partially explained by their effects on certain neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a family of eight receptor subtypes that are widely expressed throughout the mammalian CNS. In this study, the effects of physiologically relevant changes in extracellular pH were examined in mammalian cells expressing the mGluR subtypes: human mGluR1a, mGluR4a, mGluR5d or mGluR8b. The signal transduction coupling properties of mGluR4a and mGluR8b were switched from the adenylate cyclase (G(i)) pathway to the phospholipase C (G(q)) pathway by coexpression of a promiscuous G protein. Fluorometric imaging plate reader was used to measure changes in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in response to agonist. Extracellular acidification from pH 8.0 to pH 6.5 progressively diminished mGluR4 responsiveness to the agonists L-glutamate and (2S,1'S,2'R)-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine (L-CCG-I), and this inhibition was characterized by insurmountable antagonism. By comparison, extracellular acidification did not significantly alter mGluR8 responses to agonists. Furthermore, agonist activation of mGluR1a and mGluR5d was virtually unaffected by changes in pH. Because mGluR4 is expressed presynaptically and its activation inhibits the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, we propose that the net effect of proton inhibition of mGluR4 would be to reverse or prevent that suppression of neurotransmitter release. As such, local decreases in pH could have significant effects on the regulation of transmitter release and synaptic tone via modulation of mGluR4.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

At a superficial glance, this is true also for the regional policy area. At a closer look, however, there are significant differences and consequently different experiences. An important part of the analysis focuses on how regional policies in Sweden as a member of the EU, and Norway as a non-member, are influenced by European integration. Our main hypothesis is that both countries' regional policy aims and measures move towards the EU's, Sweden's faster than Norway's. The current situation seems to be that Sweden increasingly put its trust into the Structural Fund programmes, while national regional policy is allowed to gradually wither away. To Norway as a non-member of the EU this is not an option, regional policy will have to be carried out within the state framework. While the EU dimension is important for understanding differences in recent tendencies, it should not be taken for granted as the decisive factor in explaining differences. This paper tries to illuminate the regional policy experience, to what extent regional policy has a good or bad image in the two countries, as an alternative explanation to the EU dimension. The argument is that the regional policy experience has been more positive in Norway than in Sweden and that current development must be understood in this light.","[{""country"":[""Norway"",""Sweden""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This DEP system consists of mercury as a movable liquid electrode, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, SU-8-based microchannels for electrode passages, and a PDMS medium chamber. A simple squeezing method was introduced to build a thin PDMS layer at the bottom of the medium chamber to create a contactless DEP system. To determine the operating conditions, the DEP force and the friction force were analytically compared for a single cell. In addition, an appropriate frequency range for effective DEP manipulation was chosen based on an estimation of the Clausius–Mossotti factor and the effective complex permittivity of the yeast cell using the concentric shell model. With this system, we demonstrated the active manipulation of yeast cells, and measured the collection efficiency and the dielectrophoretic velocity of cells for different AC electric field strengths and applied frequencies. The experimental results showed that the maximum collection efficiency reached was approximately 90%, and the dielectrophoretic velocity increased with increasing frequency and attained the maximum value of 10.85 ± 0.95 μm/s at 100 kHz, above which it decreased.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We find strong evidence for shifts in the structural parameters of several equations of the DSGE model. In addition, our results indicate that the volatility of structural shocks has also changed over time. However, a version of the model that allows for a change in the coefficients of the Taylor rule and shock volatilities provides the best model fit. Estimates from the selected DSGE model suggest that the mid-1970s were associated with a regime characterised by a smaller reaction by the monetary authorities to inflation developments.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We tested whether the implicit effects of subliminal mere exposure could spill over to the explicit level by depleting self-control resources. Participants were subliminally exposed to a novel female photograph. Then, implicit and explicit attitudes toward an exposed and an unexposed photograph were measured. This basic design was crossed with a cognitive load manipulation, which should deplete the capacity of self-control resources (low cognitive load vs. high cognitive load). Results showed that the subliminal mere exposure effect occurred for not only implicit attitudes but also explicit attitudes when participants’ cognitive resources were depleted in the high cognitive load condition. In contrast, when cognitive resources were not depleted, the subliminal mere exposure effect only emerged for implicit attitudes. These findings support the contention that self-control failures could facilitate implicit effects of subliminal mere exposure toward the explicit level.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Although it brings significant convenience to people's lives, a purchaser often hesitates to provide a negative rating to a merchant (or commodity) after a bad online shopping experience because his sensitive information (e.g., address, telephone number, and email address) would be available to the merchant. This makes the purchaser uncomfortable and even unsafe, and the purchaser tends to contribute better but untrue ratings. Hence, the privacy of the purchaser's score is vitally important to the development of electronic commerce. In this study, we apply for the first time an artificial immune technique (i.e., the negative survey) to rate the credits of online merchants, and we propose a new credit rating model, called a negative rating model, that could preserve the privacy of the purchaser's score with low additional computational cost. Moreover, the results obtained from our credit rating model exhibited a high correlation with those from the traditional evaluation model. Therefore, the proposed model has promising application prospects.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Fleche examines how questions of national self-determination, race, class, and labor the world over influenced American interpretations of the strains on the Union and the growing differences between North and South. Setting familiar events in an international context, Fleche enlarges our understanding of nationalism in the nineteenth century, with startling implications for our understanding of the Civil War.Confederates argued that European nationalist movements provided models for their efforts to establish a new nation-state, while Unionists stressed the role of the state in balancing order and liberty in a revolutionary age. Diplomats and politicians used such arguments to explain their causes to thinkers throughout the world. Fleche maintains that the fight over the future of republican government in America was also a battle over the meaning of revolution in the Atlantic world and, as such, can be fully understood only as a part of the world-historical context in which it was fought.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Often, in an effort to update the discourse, discussions of non-marital families seem to deploy households or living arrangements as a substitute classification in the place of the old marital family. This Article argues that we need to resist the tendency to substitute the idea of ""household"" when the boundaries of legal family fail us, because households are not necessarily familial, and because core familial ties exist across multiple households. Household membership is characterized by churn, both because of changes in intimate attachments and because of life cycle changes. This Article argues that housing design and housing policy should accommodate that churn in a way that minimizes disruption to individuals' attachment to building, neighborhood, community, and family members living in separate households. It should offer options for stability that are economically realistic for people whose households will change. No single policy intervention can resolve the disruptions associated with fluctuating household membership. Rather, properly understanding the needs of families as distinct from households provides a lens for evaluating particular attributes of housing policy. Two housing principles in particular would better serve the needs of today's households. First, housing policy should prioritize the family ties of non-householders to a household. As family members exit a housing unit, housing policy should seek to stabilize their ties with the household, particularly valuing proximity. Second, the design of the unit itself should reflect the inevitable expansion and contraction in household membership. This means that the unit would allow for proximity with privacy for linked households. This Article seeks to marry insights from the emerging literature on multi-generational household design, accessory dwelling units, and micro-units, with insights from the literature on the new normative family, in the hopes of producing an improved housing policy lens.

FTIR profiles of Tamra Bhasma at different levels is not available. Aim: To evaluate the chemical changes in Tamra Bhasma at different steps by following Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Materials and Methods: In current study, raw Tamra , intermediate samples obtained during purification, incineration and Amritikarana were analyzed using FTIR. Results: It was observed that Shodhana procedure leads in the formation of bonds between surface particles of Tamra and Shodhana media. These formed bonds on the surface of Shodhita Tamra samples gave various sharp peaks representing presence of many functional groups. Conclusion: The FTIR spectra revealed that both Bhasma samples contained organic compounds probably in the form of a complex with common functional groups like alkyl, methyl, etc., which need further studies for exact characterization of the complexes.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The US Department of Defense and US Department of State jointly coordinate over $10 billion of US funding in support for infrastructure development to stimulate and complement the resources of other government and non-government investors and donors. Projects have been identified across four investor/donor organizations but prioritization of investments, especially to achieve regional sustainability, has been a challenge because of the volatile situation and complexities of negotiation among investors and donors. Our effort (i) develops a methodology to prioritize major infrastructure projects under competing assumptions of emergent conditions including security, economic, environmental, workforce, and others, and (ii) demonstrates the methodology with twenty-seven major infrastructure projects of the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan. The effort supports government and nongovernment investors, donors, and stakeholders to make effective investments in Afghanistan infrastructure development under volatile emergent conditions. The effort develops three levels of analysis. In the first level, economic and demographic data are used to prioritize needs for infrastructure development. The second level of the methodology evaluates the impacts of selected projects across fourteen performance criteria derived from the ANDS, highlighting the sensitivity of the impacts to uncertain emergent conditions through an innovative re-weighting of the performance criteria. In the third level, the methodology identifies technical and non-technical requirements and dependencies among projects in a schedule and critical path analysis. This effort has been refined in a workshop of Afghanistan expatriates and representatives of US agencies. The next steps of the effort include providing training materials and embedding the methodology to a decision-aiding software for use in the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan.","[{""country"":[""Arab World""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

GPCRs are the focus of a significant amount of current pharmaceutical research because they play a key role in many diseases. In this paper, we predict the functional nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in human GPCRs by defining optimal attributes and using a decision tree method. The predictive power of each attribute was evaluated. A subset of sequences with optimal attributes was obtained using the decision tree method combined with a genetic search algorithm. The subset contains both sequence-based and structure-based information, and the information for each subset consists of a conservation score, the location of the mutation, the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix score, as well as the hydrophobicity change, the solvent accessibility, and the buried charge. Seven important rules were derived from the decision tree. A total of 166 functional nsSNPs in human GPCRs from the dbSNP have been predicted using the optimal attributes subset.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Price risk premia are consistently negative in these livestock markets. The imposition of quarantines has a sharp negative effect on expected producer prices in the pastoral areas, revealing that Kenya's approach to animal disease control favours wealthier highlands ranchers and consumers at the expense of poorer drylands herders.

Experience in developed countries has shown that they reduce the incidence of invasive and non-invasive disease. However, there is evidence that the introduction of PCVs in universal mass vaccination programs, combined with inappropriate and extensive use of antibiotics, could be associated to changes in non-PCV serotypes, including serotype 19A. We conducted a systematic review to determine the distribution of serotype 19A, burden of pneumococcal disease and antibiotic resistance in the region. We performed a systematic review of serotype 19A data from observational and randomized clinical studies in the region, conducted between 1990 and 2010, for children under 6 years. Pooled prevalence estimates from surveillance activities with confidence intervals were calculated. We included 100 studies in 22 countries and extracted data from 63. These data reported 19733 serotyped invasive pneumococcal isolates, 3.8% of which were serotype 19A. Serotype 19A isolates were responsible for 2.4% acute otitis media episodes, and accounted for 4.1% and 4.4% of 4,380 nasopharyngeal isolates from healthy children and in hospital-based/sick children, respectively. This serotype was stable over the twenty years of surveillance in the region. A total of 53.7% Spn19A isolates from meningitis cases and only 14% from non meningitis were resistant to penicillin. Before widespread PCV implementation in this region, serotype 19A was responsible for a relatively small number of pneumococcal disease cases. With increased use of PCVs and a greater number of serotypes included, monitoring S. pneumoniae serotype distribution will be essential for understanding the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease.","[{""country"":[""Latin America & Caribbean""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In addition to operational expenses, provisional loss is a major driver to a company’s expense. The provisional loss arises due to the “bad” accounts booked – bank lends the money to customers who eventually do not have capability to pay back. In the risk management, there are generally two stages a company can take to manage and control credit risks. The first stage occurs when booking a customer. An aggressive underwriting strategy could book and approve high risk population who seeks for credit card; while a conservative policy may only focus on upmarket and affluent population. As expected, the first strategy could generate both high revenues (interests charged) and high expenses due to bad accounts booked, resulting in trivial incremental net income; and the second strategy could generate not only low revenues but also low losses, resulting in incremental net income be trivial as well. There is always trade-off for different strategies in terms revenue generation and loss control. Finding an optimal strategy is often difficult and needs to be adjusted accordingly due to internal or external factors such as macroeconomic change, for example, almost all credit companies suppressed their approval rates for high risk segments of population and incurred huge financial loss during 2008/2009 economic depression. The second stage happens in customer management after the customer is booked. Although booked customers pass the first screen of risk control, the chance of false negative (false “good” accounts) could still be high. However, in the second stage, by leveraging their performance such as credit card utilization, payment information, risks can further be managed to control provisional loss. In our project, we will focus on the second stage of risk management, and particularly are interested in classifying if a booked account will be a “bad” account within 12 months since booked. Since an internal classification model is already available, our second interest is to train a better classifier to outperform the benchmark model.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This argument follows from the international research evidence of the student experience of research and inquiry. We illustrate the argument with initiatives by curricula teams, departments and institutions who have attempted to ‘mainstream’ undergraduate research and inquiry for most or all students.

A better measure to use for such a study would be the rent paid by the genuine end-user of the property. This paper examines how equilibrium rents in different locations within Greater China are determined by the time value, or the shadow wage, of an individual. Using the rental information, we provide a first estimated ratio of time values for individuals in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Taipei.

Generally, researchers work on the art of theatre, the rhetoric of the actors, or the dramaturgy built from law cases or from the questions that the law does not completely resolve. Trials, tragedies, even comedies are close: everybody can see the interpenetration of them on stage and in the courts. We know that, and we know that the dramas are made with/from/of law, we know that the art the actors are developing is not so far from the art of the lawyers, and conversely. In this paper, I would like to have a look at the action of the audience, at the session itself and at the way the spectators are here to evaluate and judge not only the dramatic action, not only the art of the actors, not only the text of the author, but also the other spectators, and themselves too. In particular, I will focus on the “common judgment” of the audience and on its judicial, aesthetic and social relationship. The spectators have been undisciplined, noisy, unruled, during such a long period that theatre still retains some prints of this behaviour, even if nowadays, the social and aesthetic rule is to be silent. But uncertainty, inattention, distraction, contradiction, heterogeneity are the notions which characterise the session, and the judgments of the spectators still depend on them. So, what was and what is the voice of the audience? And with what sort of voice do spectators give their judgments?","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We conducted a study of the EEG patterns of 10 subjects who were given an audio stimulus of Alpha music. The EEG is acquired using BIOPAC Student Lab with suitably placed silver/silver chloride electrodes to study the effects of Alpha music on Alpha and Beta rhythms of the subjects EEG. Research shows Alpha waves are predominantly observed in healthy relaxed individuals. Since anxiety and stress are major emotional contents of human beings, the goal of this experiment is to assess the means of relaxation and concentration using Alpha music, which influence the alpha and beta rhythms significantly. For each subject, three EEG recordings were taken. One before the alpha music stimulus, one after 6 minutes of Alpha music and the last towards the end of alpha music. There was an increase in the maximum amplitudes of Alpha waves either after 6 minutes or after 12 minutes of alpha music. However, the maximum amplitude of beta waves showed a decline of up to 40% from the initial value. The standard deviation of both Alpha and Beta waves are almost stable between the mid and final recording. These results, namely, the increase in Alpha activity and decrease in Beta activity indicate that subjects experience ‘relaxed alertness’. Under the influence of Alpha music, subjects reported a dramatic reduction in feelings of stress and an increased sense of physical relaxation compared to normal state.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

ADPKD research is now seeing an intense effort to define the functions of polycystin-1 and -2, the proteins encoded by the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, and there is now a clear target in sight. In this issue of PNAS, a report by Gonzalez-Perrett et al. (1) presents evidence that polycystin-2, the protein product of the PKD2 gene, functions as a nonspecific Ca2+-permeable cation channel. In this respect, PKD research appears to be taking a page from the notebook on cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease in which pulmonary and pancreatic epithelial dysfunction is attributed to a defect in transepithelial Cl− transport (2). ::: ::: Polycystic kidneys have a striking appearance (Fig. 1). Typically, both kidneys are massively enlarged as a consequence of the growth of hundreds or thousands of cysts scattered throughout the renal cortex and medulla. The gross anatomical distortion caused by these cysts is thought to be responsible for the progressive loss of kidney function associated with this disease and the renal failure experienced by approximately 50% of affected individuals. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: Gross pathology of polycystic kidney.

We end with a proposal for a problem- focused 10-point plan to reduce the boy-problem. Our plan is “problem-focused” instead of “gender- focused”; that is, we focus on a set of problems from which boys suffer more than girls, but there is no reason why girls suffering from the same problems (e.g. excessive gaming) would not also benefit from the plan's implementation. We are optimistic that a solution of the boy-problem is possible, in particular because the proposed plan is affordable and straightforward, although it requires a major change in societal attitudes towards discipline and education.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Entrepreneurial profits are stochastic. The occupational choice under risk endogenizes the number of firms in the intermediate goods industry. While the presence of entrepreneurial risk results in a suboptimally low number of firms and depresses growth, non-linear tax schemes are partly capable of compensating the negative by effects by ex post providing a social insurance.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A descriptive review was conducted to determine the patterns of antimicrobial resistance in isolates of blood stream infection among hospitalized children in India. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: Published and gray literature on antibiotic resistance in children was searched using ""Google Scholar"", ""Scopus"", and ""PubMed"" databases between January 2000 and July 2015. Studies were included if they were original articles that reported a minimum of 10 pathogenic bacterial isolates from the bloodstream within a pediatric population in India, and studies were excluded if they reported studies done during an outbreak or epidemic. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: A total of 1179 studies were screened, and 82 papers were identified as eligible for inclusion. Most studies (78.7%) were reported from neonatal intensive care units. Among a total of 50545 reported blood cultures, 14704 (29.1%) were positive. Staphylococcus aureus (median, 14.7%; IQR, 7.4%-25.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (median, 26%; IQR, 16.7%-35.4%) were the commonest reported Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, respectively. Approximately half of all S aureus isolates were reported as methicillin-resistant S aureus (median, 50%; IQR, 31.4%-65.1%). After age stratification, the median rate of resistance of common Gram-negative pathogens to ampicillin and gentamicin/amikacin were extremely high (K pneumoniae/ampicillin 95.9%; K pneumoniae/gentamicin 75%; Escherichia coli/ampicillin 92.9%; E coli/gentamicin 55.6%). Likewise, the median resistance of common Gram-negative blood stream isolates to cephalosporins were also high (K pneumoniae/cefotaxime 62.6%; E coli/cefotaxime 47.5%). ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: High rates of resistance to World Health Organization-recommended first-line treatment options for neonates and children have been identified in blood stream infections across India. There is an urgent need to both enhance antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention and control measures and consider urgently how to repurpose older antibiotics back into routine care in India.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Character of the Governmental Action 247CONCLUSION 249INTRODUCTIONThis Note examines one of the more recent potential challenges that academia has raised to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA): the minimum Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) as an unconstitutional taking of property under the Fifth Amendment. This Note argues that, under the appropriate constitutional analysis, the MLR does not rise to the level of a taking.1The ACA was enacted to address two primary problems in the American healthcare industry: access and affordability.2 Before the ACA was enacted, over 47 million Americans-18% of the population-did not have health insurance.3 The main barrier to coverage was cost: most people who did not have health care usually did not have access to employer health insurance, and could not afford to purchase it on their own.4 Additionally, lack of coverage was a long-term problem for most uninsured, with 47% reporting that they had been uninsured for five years or more, and 18% reporting that they had never had any coverage at all.5 Uninsured Americans had few ways to get affordable health care. Most Americans obtain health insurance through their employer, but 80% of uninsured Americans had no access to employer insurance, and most of the remaining 20% reported that the employer insurance was too expensive.6Despite the number of uninsured individuals, over the last thirty years, healthcare spending in the United States has snowballed.7 Americans spend more per year on healthcare costs than people in any other country with comparable per capita income levels.8 Additionally, the rate at which that number is growing is increasing quickly- faster than overall economic growth and the rate of inflation. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This paper illustrates the relationship between energy reforms and economic sustainable development in Egypt and Iran; through analyzing the relation between energy reform and four main macroeconomic variables, namely: budget deficit, energy consumption, inflation and economic growth. The methodology adopted in this paper is a comparative case study between Egypt and Iran, using qualitative descriptive analysis; focusing on the period from 2010 to 2014, as this period is characterized with active subsidy reform efforts for both countries. The paper concludes that reforming energy subsidies generally tends to relief the strain on the public budget, in case it is not accompanied with simultaneous economic difficulties which can deem the reform efforts obsolete, like in the case of Iran. In addition, the responsiveness of energy consumption of a certain fuel to the increase in its price is heavily reliant on its price elasticity of demand. This is represented in the availability of alternative energy sources. Moreover, the effect of the reforms on inflation is normally instantaneous and short-lived and could be mitigated through government intervention; that was clear in the case of Egypt. However, Iran did not show a similar trend as there was a weak correlation between subsidy reforms and inflation. Finally, there tends to be a very weak relationship between subsidy reforms and GDP growth, implying that the effect of other economic factors outweighs that of subsidy reforms. Keywords.

These effects can be divided into three categories. The first is substantive effects. These include binding, authorizing and (dis)empowering effects. The second category is causative effects, which are the triggering effects that determinations of fact or of law have on substantive effects by bringing them into existence. The third category is modal effects – how and when the substantive effects come into existence (e.g. immediate or deferred, retroactive or non-retroactive, reversible or irreversible effect). Each of these categories of legal effects behaves differently according to whether the effects are intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic effects are based on the special treaty powers of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly. In this hypothesis, all three categories of effects exist to the full extent that the explicit and implicit powers of the adopting body allow for them. Extrinsic effects are directly based on general international law, in particular on the rules of formation of customary international law. Here, there are no causative effects. Substantive effects do not strictly speaking exist; only pre-substantive ones do. And modal effects are always immediate, non-retroactive.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

To facilitate direct observations of Cdc42 activation in live cells, we developed and validated a new biosensor of Cdc42 activation. The biosensor is genetically encoded, of single-chain design and capable of correctly localizing to membrane compartments as well as interacting with its upstream regulators including the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. We characterized this new biosensor in motile mouse embryonic fibroblasts and observed robust activation dynamics at leading edge protrusions, similar to those previously observed for endogenous Cdc42 using the organic dye-based biosensor system. We then extended our validations and observations of Cdc42 activity to macrophages, and show that this new biosensor is able to detect differential activation patterns during phagocytosis and cytokine stimulation. Furthermore, we observe for the first time, a highly transient and localized activation of Cdc42 during podosome formation in macrophages, which was previously hypothesized but never directly visualized.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Despite the fact that the physical therapy profession trains practitioners to help clients with disabilities to maximize their physical function and teaches them how to adapt to the challenges of daily activity, we initially assumed that a blind student would not be able to complete the program or be able to become a self-sufficient practitioner. We were very wrong. This article describes our learning process over the course of an eighteen-month program and details a valuable pedagogical experience pertinent to anyone in the teaching profession.

The paper proposes, instead, a new, limited statutory interconnection rule, which the FCC could enforce in limited ways in Internet markets. The paper also argues that, even if the FCC does have authority to develop its own common law of Internet regulation, a limited grant of statutory authority is a superior regulatory construct. The paper also argues that FCC administration of this proposed statute is superior to remitting all Internet interconnection problems to the common law processes of antitrust. Professor Philip Weiser's contribution to the same journal issue (also available on SSRN) takes a different, more expansive view of the FCC's ancillary jurisdiction.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The technological possibilities developed in the ‘information society’, together with the social and cultural trend for more participation, opened this field to new actors, which caused professional journalists to lose their traditional monopoly of searching, gathering, editing and diffusing news in the public sphere. At the same time, these new possibilities of communicating are increasingly forcing the old actors to play new roles in the media. The digital techniques and the Internet gave birth to a big diversity of new media and of new forms of dealing with journalism and public information. ‘Citizen journalism’, ‘participatory journalism’, ‘user-generated content’, ‘crowdsourcing’, ‘weblogs’,‘ Twitter’, ‘Facebook’, etc., are words and expressions rather common these days, all of them somehow calling the attention to the fact that journalism-as-a-professional-activity seems to coexist more and more with various forms of journalismas-a-civic-activity , performed by very different people, under very different conditions and with very different levels of involvement and expertise. As a consequence, questions are being raised about the ethical implications of this new scenario, both in what regards the activity of professional journalists in new (online) media and the active commitment of ‘laypersons’ in the process of gathering, editing and diffusing information. In this paper we will try to analyze and to discuss these questions, with reference, among others, to Eliot Freidson (2004) and his distinction between ‘practice ethics’ and ‘institutional ethics’. Furthermore, we’ll try to discuss what really makes journalism distinctive from other practices that nowadays coexist with it in the public sphere, strongly increasing the possibilities of communication between people but not necessarily following the purposes of public interest and of civic democratic participation. In this context, the concept of journalism seems to ask for a clearer definition, and so do the roles to be played by journalists in the more complex (but also more stimulating) media environment we are dealing with in contemporary societies.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It was found that down regulation of APAF1, a putative tumor suppressor gene (TSG), leads to resistance to chemotherapy and disease development in some cancers. In this study, we investigated the relation of APAF1 methylation status with its expression and clinicopathological factors in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Materials andMethods: Methylation Sensitive-High Resolution Melting Curve Analysis (MS-HRM) was employed in studying the methylation of CpG islands in the APAF1promoter region in MDS. Gene expression was analyzed by using real time RT-PCR. Results: 42.6% of patient samples were methylated in promoter region of APAF1analyzed, while methylation of the gene was not seen in controls (P<0.05). Methylation of APAF1was significantly associated with the suppression of its mRNA expression (P=0.00). The methylation status of APAF1in advanced-stage MDS patients (80%) was significantly higher than that of the early-stage MDS patients (28.2%) (P=0.001). The difference in frequency of hypermethylatedAPAF1 gene was significant between good (37.5%) and poor (85.71%) cytogenetic risk groups (P=0.043). In addition, a higher frequency of APAF1hypermethylation was observed in higher-risk MDS group (69.2%) compared to lower-risk MDS group (34.14%) (P=0.026). Conclusion: Our study indicated that APAF1hypermethylation in MDS was associated to high-risk disease classified according to the IPSS, WHO and cytogenetic risk.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Landfills, the most common means to dispose of municipal solid waste (MSW), lead to the conversion of the organic waste to biogas, containing about 50% methane, a very active greenhouse gas (GHG). One unit of methane has a global warming potential of 21 computed for a 100-year horizon or 56 computed for 20 years. The waste sector in Israel contributes 13% of total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions for a time horizon of 100 years (for a time horizon of 20 years, the waste sector contribution equals to more than 25% of total GHG emissions). The ultimate goal is to minimize the amount of methane (CH4) by converting it to CO2. This can be achieved by physicochemical means (e.g., landfill gas flare, incineration) or by biological processes (e.g., composting, anaerobic digestion). Since the waste in Israel has a high organic material content, it was found that the most cost-effective means to treat the degradable organic components is by aerobic composting (investment of less than US$ 10 to reduce emission of one ton CO2 equivalent per year). Another benefit of this technology is the ability to implement it within a short period. The suggested approach, which should be implemented especially in developing countries, could reduce a significant amount of GHG at relatively low cost and short time. The development of a national policy for proper waste treatment can be a significant means to abate GHG emissions in the short term, enabling a gain in time to develop other means for the long run. In addition, the use of CO2 quotas will credit the waste sector and will promote profitable proper waste management.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The family planning policy up to several decades has alleviated the pressure of an increasing population at the beginning. However, China initially implemented an unbalanced development strategy, which has resulted in a large number of labor force in the eastern coastal areas of the country that in turn helped the economic development of these regions. In the future, China plans on transferring its economic center to the midwest and northeast regions, which will also require a workforce. Thus, understanding the demographic situation is a must, especially the family planning policy's contribution to population loss in these provinces. This paper uses the propensity score matching method based on GDP per capita to calculate the absolute value of population loss in China's provinces due to the family planning policy by comparing these provinces with countries that do not implement the family planning policy using a 1:4 ratio. Additionally, we calculate the population loss ratio. Until 2014, the provinces with over 10 million population loss have reached 19 and the provinces with over 50% of population loss have reached 8, which are all located in the midwest and northeast regions, where their economy is relatively stagnant.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In such a setting, contracts play two roles: providing incentives to influence the retailer's forecasting decision and eliciting information obtained by forecasting to inform production decisions. We focus on two forms of contracts that are widely used in such settings and are mirror images of one another: a rebates contract, which compensates the retailer for the units she sells to end consumers, and a returns contract, which compensates the retailer for the units that are unsold. We characterize the optimal rebates contracts and returns contracts. Under rebates, the retailer, manufacturer, and total system may benefit from the retailer having inferior forecasting technology; this never occurs under returns. Although one might conjecture that returns would be inferior because its provision of “insurance” would discourage the retailer from forecasting, we show that returns are superior.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

How can the transformation of the German electricity sector be achieved and at what costs? This paper addresses these questions by means of a meta-analysis of 10 recent model-based mitigation scenarios for Germany. It turns out that the scenarios exploit the three basic strategic options of increasing the share of RES-E – domestic RES-E generation, electricity demand reductions, and RES-E imports – to substantially different extents. Domestic RES-E generation increases in all scenarios, particularly from onshore and offshore wind. Scenarios that rely heavily on reducing electricity demand require a relatively low expansion of domestic RES-E generation. Despite detailed technical analyses, insights on the costs of the transformation remain limited. A discussion of underlying scenario assumptions reveals that it is unclear whether (i) RES-E and system integration technology development will be as cost-competitive as postulated, (ii) implicitly assumed institutional requirements will be realized, and (iii) relevant actors in the transformation process will be incentivized accordingly. Therefore, future research should pursue a thorough assessment of strategic options for transforming the German electricity system that consistently integrates technologies, institutions, and actors.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The European Urban Charter is provided by the Council of Europe in relation to urban policy. It came as a logical outcome of the European campaign for urban renewal organized by the Council of Europe in 1980-1982.The purpose of this charter is to provide a practical tool and a manual for urban management authorities. Moreover, this charter is committed to provide a business card for the Council of Europe on issues related to the environment and the act of building. After this outline of European urban space, the environment and its principles it is clearer which is the road where the Albanian society will have to walk and on what principles will be built the national plan for urban spatial planning. The development of our cities modeled on European cities is likely to be cost, not only because of the historical developments, but more for reasons of political transition in the Albanian society which continues to hold back our cities.

We find that becoming self-employed is indeed associated with a relative increase in risk attitudes, an increase that is quantitatively large and significant even after controlling for individual characteristics, different employment status, and duration of entrepreneurship. The findings suggest that studies assuming that risk attitudes are stable over time suffer from reverse causality; risk attitudes do not remain stable over time, and individual preferences change endogenously.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We challenge the prevailing ""finance follows"" mindset and â€“ using Private Equity (PE) investors as an illustrative example â€“ we demonstrate how an integrated approach may improve existing theories and open up entirely new avenues of research. We present confirmatory as well as exploratory findings on the impact of investors, suggesting that a company's ownership not only determines a company's financial strength but also has a number of less obvious implications for growth and internationalization. Our findings suggest that investors may be a strategic asset and can serve as catalysts for a company's growth at several levels of involvement.","[{""country"":[""Austria""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Five 1-day-old neonatal mice were exposed by oral inoculation to the homogenized brain of a scrapie-affected sheep. In the small intestine of all mice 1 hour after inoculation, immunoreactivity with antinormal prion protein (PrPc) antibody was seen in the cytoplasm of villus enterocytes. This finding suggests transmission of abnormal PrPsc into the cytoplasm of enterocytes. In control mice treated with normal sheep brain, no PrPc signal was seen in enterocytes of the small intestine. Immunopositivity for neurofilament protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein was seen in the cytoplasm of enterocytes of mice inoculated with scrapie and normal sheep brain. This suggests that the enterocytes of neonatal mice can absorb PrPsc and other macromolecular proteins of the sheep brain affected by scrapie and may be more important than previously thought as a pathway for PrPsc transmission in neonatal animals.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This disconfirmatory finding indicates the need to move away from structural-deterministic models of coupling that presume a functional compliance between external pressures and organizational practices – toward fresh perspectives that shed light to latent phenomenological processes underlying the substantive implementation of organizational rituals. To this end, we propose that coupling can be an unintended organizational state made possible due to failure to appreciate the cynical and mythological underpinnings of institutional rituals.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This decline has been largely driven by a 17 percentage point reduction in the proportion of high school dropouts working even a single week per year. One common explanation for this trend, declining real wages, ignores the fact that the value of working today depends on future returns to experience. This paper estimates a model of labor supply with returns to experience as an explanatory variable, using data from the Current Population Survey. The classic myopic labor supply model (in which only the current wage matters) is rejected in favor of one that includes forward-looking considerations, embodied in returns to experience. For high school dropouts, decreasing returns to experience explain 30 percent of the decline in participation between 1967 and 1977. Changes in wages do not explain any of this trend.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We investigate how investment behavior changes when investment is subject to time-to-build versus when it is not. We characterize equilibrium investment strategies under several information structures and compare results to the social optimum. We offer some new results. The model predicts that, controlling for demand, and production and investment costs, investments and outputs can be higher in progressive industries (which often exhibit time-to-build) than in fast-paced industries (where time-to-build is insignificant). Furthermore, for both investment types (investment with or without time-to-build) we offer a novel equilibrium in which firms incrementally invest. This behavior is driven by demand uncertainty and capacity constraints. Also, expected outputs are lower than Cournot outputs as firms face uncertainty. Moreover, the amount of uncertainty has different effects over investment types.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Some important questions in this paper are why did the Constitutional Court annul CR-CW in Law 27/2007? Whether the new concept offered in the Court Decision and consistent with 1945 Constitution? And how is the new concept offered consistent with people empowerment? The revoke of CR-CW in Law 27/2007 is caused that the concept of concession is contrary to the norms of natural resources management in the 1945 Constitution and the spirit of people empowerment. The new concept offered in the Decision is the common access. In this concept of access, CA-SI is regarded as the common property with the rules from members of the community itself. The provisions to access CA-SI as the common property are also determined by agreements of the community itself. Management of CA-SI on the common access is in accordance with people empowerment.

Further, since the majority of not-for-profit organizations are not subject to public audit mandates, this study also ascertains whether other market actors such as donors monitor and demand accrual-based financial information. The empirical analyses indicate that not-for-profit organizations subject to public audit mandates are largely in compliance with GAAP, although a significant minority of organizations subject to state requirements is not; further analyses suggest that external oversight significantly influence the use of accrual reporting. Models are also tested on a subsample of not-for-profits that switched from cash to accrual reporting, with the results suggesting that increasing public and market oversight have a significant effect on the decision to switch methods.

Parliament should recognise that there is a groundswell of judicial (and academic) opinion which suggests that, if the current legal framework regulating the sharing of information for the purposes of public protection is lawful, even in the face of criticism from the European Court of Human Rights, then an intolerable level of uncertainty as to the issue of that legality has now been reached. This paper addresses the root causes of this legal uncertainty, and argues for statutory reform to revisit even recent tinkering with the law in this area. In an overview of both a body of common law, in the form of a series of key decisions from the courts, as well as the tensions between two tracts of legislation, promoting public protection and human rights values occasionally at odds with one another, this piece examines the crucial issue of the retention of criminality information and the idea of individual (offender) consultation over its use in public protection work.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This article studies the distribution network design with considering externality of transportation, firstly setting up a concept model and secondly putting the experience data to get different networks with different externality rates. The article further analyzes the results of distribution networks with different rates and recognizes that the valuation of externality rate is the key for distribution network design and the external costs should be brought into the social total cost to get the optimal network design.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We propose a theoretical model showing that welfare policies follow the median voter constituency regardless of whether governments are center-left or center-right in the majority electoral system, whereas large differences exist between center-left and center- right coalitions in the proportional representation system. We exploit these differences in the mechanisms of welfare expenditure to estimate their elasticities on income inequality and find that a 1% increase in government spending reduces the Gini income index by half a percentage point. This result is robust under different compositions of expenditure, alternative imputation model specifications and falsification tests.","[{""country"":[""OECD members""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Often noted is the need for grassroots work to be carried out ‘with,’ rather than ‘on’ or ‘for,’ a community. Although this notion implies partnership, how the planner-community relationship is conceived depends largely on how the community is defined. From a community-based perspective, action is critical to the development of a community’s identity. This outlook suggests that participation determines community membership. Accordingly, conventional community limits may be transformed. The purpose of this article is to offer an understanding of how community-based planners may be viewed to be community members. The focus is the various perspectives on community and their respective implications for membership. To begin, the traditional perspective of community that is grounded in realism is presented. A community-based outlook based on participation is then provided. Subsequently recognized is the importance of dialogue, which is an underdeveloped and, at times, overlooked strategy in community-based practice. The connection between the planner and community is later described, followed by an examination of the issue of power. To conclude, an emphasis is placed on the possibility for a planner to become a community member when a project follows community-based philosophy.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

S. Department of Education, 1994). This legislation promulgated the need for standards-based education and impacted health education in several ways. First, it urged the establishment of “safe, disciplined, and alcohol and drugfree schools” that would provide students with the environment conducive to learning and required that schools provide drug and alcohol education as part of a comprehensive health education curriculum (U. S. Department of Education, 1994, p. 3). Secondly, this legislation encouraged the development of “outcomes” or standards that defined what K-12 students should know and be able to do. In fact, one objective of goal three specified that “all students have access to physical education and health education to ensure they are healthy and fit” (p. 1). Student standards for health education were published in 1995 in the National Health Education Standards (Joint Committee on National Health Education Standards, 1995). These seven standards provide performance-based criteria required for meeting specific levels of health education knowledge and skills in elementary, middle-level, and secondary grades. Thirdly, Goals 2000 specifically addressed teacher education and professional development, so that teachers could “acquire the knowledge and skills needed to prepare students for the next century” (U. S. Department of Education, 1994, p. 2). In other words, standards for teachers in all subject areas including health education were needed to specifically determine the competencies for professional development to be demonstrated.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However convenient, this is a limited approach, especially when applied to small and illiquid markets such as the Croatian market, where such assumptions are hardly realistic. Thus, there is a demand for including other sources of data, such as financial reports. Research poses the question of whether financial ratios as criteria for stock selection are of any use to Croatian investors. Financial and market data from selected publicly companies listed on the Croatian capital market are used. A two-stage portfolio selection strategy is applied, where the first stage involves selecting stocks based on the respective Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency scores. DEA models are becoming popular in stock portfolio selection given that the methodology includes numerous models that provide a great flexibility in selecting inputs and outputs, which in turn are considered as criteria for portfolio selection. Accordingly, there is much room for improvement of the current proposed strategies for selecting portfolios. In the second stage, two portfolio-weighting strategies are applied using equal proportions and scoreweighting. To show whether these strategies create outstanding out–of–sample portfolios in time, time-dependent DEA Window Analysis is applied using a reference time of one year, and portfolio returns are compared with the market portfolio for each period. It is found that the financial data are a significant indicator of the future performance of a stock and a DEA-based portfolio strategy outperforms market return.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This finding has a very strong implication for the effectiveness of fiscal policies that change the allocation of resources between generations. We build a two-sided altruistic-linkage model in which private transfers are made in the presence of two types of shocks: an “observable” shock that is public information (for example, a public redistribution like debt or pay-as-you-go social security) and an “unobservable” shock that is private information (for example, individual wage innovations). Parents and children observe each other’s total income but not each other’s effort level. In the second-best solution, unobservable shocks are only partially shared, whereas, for any utility function satisfying a condition derived herein, observable shocks are fully shared. The model, therefore, can generate the low degree of risk sharing found in previous empirical studies, but REH still holds.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This paper outlines and assesses the arguments used to justify current prices. Rather than structural factors (such as population growth and housing supply) being the main elements supporting current house prices, the alternative view is that cyclical factors, essentially low interest rates and low unemployment, are the key factors currently keeping Australian house prices at their present levels. Analysis of the housing market from an investor's perspective also suggests that very optimistic assumptions of future house price growth and/or future rental growth are being factored into current market pricing. The strong economic conditions in Australia, reflected in the low unemployment rate, should protect the Australian housing market from a US-style housing collapse in the short term, but in the longer term increasing unemployment will inevitably cause some correction in house prices.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The ambition of this chapter is to explore if and how Western societies can mentally arm themselves against such threats and whether the concept of resilience can play a role in this. Two options present themselves. The isolationist option aims at closing off society from outward threats and maintaining the status quo. The other option sees resilience as renewal. This one lends itself as a useful interpretative framework to further study of the resilience of the home front as a contribution to deterrence. It seeks to influence the international context in such a way that the core values of society are thought anew, modernised or made to work in a new context.","[{""country"":[""Europe & Central Asia"",""Russian Federation""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

An Analysis of the Determinants of Campaign Volatility at the 2014 Belgian Federal Elections","This article examines the causes of stability and change in vote intentions during the 2014 Belgian federal election campaign. Drawing on data from the 2014 Parti Rep Belgian Voter Survey, our study aims to explain why a large number of voters have switched their vote intention in the weeks preceding the federal elections. To this end, we test a series of hypotheses drawn from different theories often referred to in the literature to account for campaign volatility. The results of our analysis reveal that voters can decide to change their vote preferences during the campaign due to strategic considerations related to their perceptions of the coalition potentials of parties. We also find that voters with a low level of political interest are more likely than highly interested voters to switch from one party to another in the weeks preceding the electoral contest. Unsurprisingly, a high degree of affection for the favourite party proves to be a barrier against campaign volatility. The higher the level of affect directed to the most preferred party, the more stable will be the vote intention. Moreover, results show that citizens with a low level of external political efficacy are more prone than others to switch parties in the last weeks of the campaign. By contrast, the ideological profile of the voter has no significant impact on campaign volatility.","[{""country"":[""Belgium""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The problem, however, is that poor who need to become active actors in their development to enable them get the basic right are often beyond easy reach. These peculiarities or differences render the task of involving poor people in the planning and implementation of development efforts difficult. In line with the design of decentralization which is faulty in the first place with full of legal contradictions and ambiguities, the participatory process has descended into an arena for predatory politics. If that so, the research will take advantage of the possibility of a critical perspective afforded by the community development perspective at helping communities achieve the basic right of clean water as poverty reduction strategies in the shaping of specific developmental intervention by donor, to examine the sustainable development. More over, the objectives of this research go beyond reporting on the degree of success of the efforts at mainstreaming community development concerns in the sustainable development, though it draws upon many such reports. In particular, a primary role is played by processes of “collective learning” which result in a “socialized” growth of knowledge and embedded not only in the internal culture of local community but, particularly, for the international development agencies.

The body of the article is comprised of five sections. Following a brief introduction I begin by examining al-Ṭahṭāwī's justifications for the mission's pursuit of sciences in Paris. These work to communicate a compatibility between Islamic precedent and learning sciences abroad. The next section moves to consider whether and how the ‘Franks’ sciences’ connect to their Christianity. I then focus on how al-Ṭahṭāwī categorically portrays those sciences the mission seeks to learn, which he refers to as ʿulūm ḥikmiyya, before turning to concentrate on his presentation of the universal structure of transmitted (naqliyya) and rational (ʿaqliyya) sciences. Together, these two sections show how al-Ṭahṭāwī incorporates and assimilates the Franks' sciences into an Islamic model, restricting these sciences as partial while easing and advocating for their integration into the Islamic lands. The fifth and final section looks more closely at how al-Ṭahṭāwī describes the universal sciences of language alongside the singularity of Arabic in order to draw attention to consequences of al-Ṭahṭāwī's efforts to translate across French and Arabic. In closing I offer a few remarks about how and why al-Ṭahṭāwī frames the Franks' sciences as he does, and suggest how the assimilation of their sciences impacts the greater Islamic structure that absorbs them.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The analysis shows that dual-earner couples put roughly equal weights on each partner's expected wage gains when deciding to migrate. Moreover, migrant wives' employment declines temporarily and there are significant selection effects in migration and employment among non-migrants.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, their integration into every day classroom practice remains an issue. This paper is based on the remark that changes in teaching and learning activities may often be related to prior research, whose results have been disseminated in a selective way, among innovators, then reinterpreted and modified by different actors. Founded on a recent French synthesis, it presents some current research questions and advocates the opportunity of developing modes of cooperative research associating teachers and researchers and including an international dimension, because similar problems appear at the same time in different countries. Context: a strong interest for ICT As in other countries, ICT, and more specifically the Internet, has received in France much attention in the last few years. New words have appeared in French, directly imported from English: web, e-business, e-learning, the “e” being pronounced like English speaking people do, like a French “i”. This is of course not the first time such phenomena occur and it does not prove much in itself, except may be the fact that new realities are quickly disseminating all over the world, and that they are perceived as having originated in the Anglo-American sphere (which is largely true). The level of expectations in the society, as relayed by the media, remains rather high and, so far, there has not been much public expression of distrust toward ICT, like in (Cordes & Miller 2000). Although the rates of connection are probably on the average slightly lower than in the USA, many people do have access to the Internet (particularly in affluent homes and at the workplace, relegating on shelves the Minitel, the French Network Computer first distributed more than 20 years ago). If ICT has therefore become rather commonplace in the French society, and if new activities using the Internet are spreading, there is still a form of digital divide: rates of internet connection in families depends very much upon the social milieu, even if nearly every school children have, in a way or another, access to computers, notably computer games. In schools, a national plan concerning the Internet has been launched by the previous minister of education in 1997, aiming at connecting every school and every teacher to the Internet. Symbolically, teachers have been offered a professional e-mail account, managed by the administration (but they have to pay the internet provider costs). The department of education has also devoted important funds to the dissemination of resources toward teachers and faculty members (MEN 2002). Interestingly enough, relationships are being established between schools, regional or local authorities and enterprises, in order to facilitate Internet access to every school. This is relatively new in France where, except in technological and vocational training, there has been for a long time a rather sharp separation between the hierarchies of the “Education nationale”, relayed in every region and territorial administrative unit, the local authorities and the enterprises. The national level has always been responsible for the contents and modalities of education, while the local authorities have been, since the decentralization laws in the eighties, in charge of infrastructure issues. The enterprises had, until now played a very limited role within schools, except in vocational and technological sectors. With the surge of ICT, one can notice a permeability between traditional boundaries, infrastructure decisions often having pedagogical consequences.","[{""country"":[""France""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Really, it is a story about students trying to seize kairos, the opportune moment in time to effectuate change. Seeing an opportune moment in time to call attention to a legal issue they identified as important, the three third-year law students in this story wrote, as amici curiae, a brief in support of a petition for certification to the New Jersey Supreme Court on the issue of whether indigent litigants in civil domestic violence cases have the right to court-appointed attorneys. These students and their professors believed the timing was right to argue that indigent litigants involved in the New Jersey domestic violence restraining order process have a legal right to court-appointed counsel as a requirement of equal access to a fair trial. The issue had been briefly raised several years earlier. However, the right to counsel issue had been completely disregarded by the courts, and no state-based advocacy groups pursued the issue. These students, in contrast, saw something to the issue that other advocates had missed. Moreover, they saw it at the right time in their own legal education to act on it, compellingly. The article offers a rhetorical analysis of what they wrote, what happened, and the impact on advocacy in New Jersey domestic violence law.","[{""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Competitive types compare future consumption (i.e. wealth) with the mean. Self-sufficient types derive utility simply from their own consumption and do not compare themselves with others. I derive a condition under which the utility (happiness) of both types increases when the economy is populated by a larger share of competitive types. In the long-run the condition is always fulfilled when the economy is capable of economic growth. The reason for this phenomenon is that competitive types generate higher savings and thus higher aggregate capital stock and income per capita, which raises utility of both types. I show that the result is robust to the consideration of endogenous work effort and that a sufficiently high share of competitive types in a society can be inevitable for long-run economic growth to exist.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This study examines the perception of relationships between staff and students in the application of security measures in secondary schools and the setbacks between teachers and students in the enforcement of educational policy in schools. This study looks at the situation in two Local Government Areas in the Riverine area of Rivers State, Nigeria where the story is the same in terms of the safety and security of school children. This study found fear among students and staff, anxiety, uncertainty, low morale, and absenteeism as a result of bullying and violence. This study identified a number of challenges, which include the absence of electricity, the uncooperative attitude of some Nigerians towards innovation, and lack of funds. This paper echoes the voices of concerned Nigerians and notes that if stringent measures are not put in place to ensure safety in schools, Nigeria risks not producing the men and women it needs (with adequate skills and education) to guide the country in the coming years. This study recommends that federal, state and local governments have emergency notification systems mounted in strategic locations in schools.

Using in-depth interviews, we investigate the motivations and the obstacles underlying the publication of grassroots information related to the postearthquake situation. Findings highlight that people were largely motivated to upload their content online: (1) to contrast the quake-related news provided by Italian mainstream media with their own perceptions; (2) to document their lives and the ‘real situation’ of the city; and (3) to share their points of view with other citizens trying to re-establish online the ties broken offline because of the catastrophe. Analysis shows that these non-professional journalists also had to face a series of obstacles, such as risks of fragmentation and lack of professionalism, funding and visibility.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This has resulted from the significant rise in the levels of drug use and the problems associated with this behaviour. Illicit drug use among young people has risen steadily over the past 30 years in the UK and beyond (Miller and Plant, 2001). Illegal drugs now account for 8 per cent of global trade and represents the third largest industry in the world after oil and arms. Young (2002) estimates the illicit drug trade has an annual turnover of 100 billion dollars, making it the world’s largest rogue industry against which few effective levers or sanctions exist. ::: ::: Trends in illicit drug use have changed in recent years as the number of people using drugs rose steadily throughout the twentieth century particularly amongst young people in the last two decades (Measham et al, 1998; Hibbell et al, 1997). The literature has traditionally focused upon the cause of drug use behaviour from the perspective of the individual, examining factors such as: family life, school life, friendship networks and the areas in which they live. This paper looks beyond these individual factors through an examination of the value of the social exclusion discourse which offers a more holistic approach to our understanding of adolescent drug use behaviours. Such an approach provides the opportunity to understand adolescent drug use from a perspective that presents a more all-encompassing view of the lives of drug-using young people. In doing so, it also provides insights for the design and development of drug prevention programmes.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Our analysis draws on RAND's recently completed study of contemporary damage class action practice and on the extensive theoretical literature on entrepreneurial litigation. Our goal is to identify mechanisms for enhancing the system's capacity to screen out non-meritorious suits, while preserving access for meritorious actions. While recognizing other concerns related to class actions (such as agency problems between class counsel and class members, and ethical issues), we do not address these problems except as they pertain to the question of screening. Similarly, we do not attempt to discuss the full range of proposals that have been put forward to address the various perceived problems relating to damage class actions, but instead focus on those proposals that are most relevant to the question of screening. The first two strategies we consider would attempt to enhance the system's screening capacity directly, at the front end of the litigation process, by applying a cost-benefit test at the time of certification, or by requiring class members to decide whether to participate at the inception of litigation. We conclude that it is unlikely that judges could apply a cost-benefit test fairly and consistently, and that an opt-in requirement might screen out as many meritorious suits as non-meritorious actions (if not more). The next two strategies would attempt to enhance the system's screening capacity indirectly, at the back end rather than the front end. The first and relatively non-controversial back-end strategy relies on judges to use more vigorously their authority to scrutinize class action settlements and fee award requests. By better calibrating the benefits to class members and financial rewards to class counsel, more rigorous judicial management would drive out ""bad"" class actions while maintaining access for meritorious lawsuits. The theoretical literature on entrepreneurial litigation and RAND's case study investigations provide the grounding for this strategy. While we believe that increased judicial scrutiny could substantially improve the system's screening capacity, relying solely on judicial discretion for regulatory purposes has some obvious weaknesses?particularly in our federal system, in which parties who cannot satisfy one judge may simply depart that jurisdiction for another whose judges are more congenial. Hence we consider a different and more controversial approach to re-calibrating incentives to file and settle non-meritorious suits: adopting loser-pays attorney fee-shifting for certified damage class actions, with liability on the plaintiffs' side borne by class counsel. Although critics of class actions have proposed other manipulations of financial incentives, such as auctions, to improve the cost-benefit ratio of damage class actions, those who support the use of representative litigation in at least some circumstances have generally rejected fee-shifting out of hand. Our analysis suggests that such a version of loser-pays might have some positive effects on the damage class-action regime by increasing the costs of bringing non-meritorious suits, while at the same time somewhat increasing the benefits of pursuing meritorious cases. The many practical problems associated with integrating this approach into American class action practice, however, raise questions about its practicability, and it is unclear whether the posited improvements in the cost-benefit ratio would be large enough to merit seeking solutions to these knotty problems. Hence we conclude by urging further attention to judicial regulation, while inviting more serious scholarly consideration of fee-shifting strategies.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Supporters of these reforms argue that they are simply a response to the inability of the traditional juvenile court to deal adequately with violent youth crime, but the legal changes that have transformed the system have often been undertaken in an atmosphere of moral panic, with little deliberation about consequences and costs.In this book we argue that a developmental model of regulation that is grounded in scientific knowledge about adolescence and juvenile crime is more compatible with the justice system's commitment to fairness and also more likely to promote social welfare than the contemporary approach. This premise for the most part translates into a legal regime that deals with most adolescent offenders as an intermediate legal category of persons - neither children nor adults. Developmental knowledge clarifies that the typical teenage offender is less culpable than his adult counterpart and therefore deserves less punishment. It also indicates that most adolescents mature out of their inclination to get involved in criminal activity, and that correctional interventions may influence the trajectories of their adult lives.

I also find that, making firm size endogenous, stronger property rights protection makes the optimal firm size larger. Using novel and unique Norwegian data, I obtain results that are consistent with previous employer size exerting a noticeable influence on entrepreneurial performance.

The question will be asked around why the Suri, a small agro-pastoral people at the margins of state power centres, failed to develop solutions to growing problems of group conflict, challenges of state policy, the spread of small arms (since the late 1980s), and the lack of forming new local alliances with neighbouring groups. Social and cultural effects of violence are fragmenting Suri society and their regional position is weakened, in contrast to, for instance, the Nyangatom or Anywaa, neighbouring ethnic groups of comparable size, but who are more successful in the ethno-federal political structure of post-1991 Ethiopia. In addition, while the Suri are affected by new globalizing influences like tourism and evangelical Christianity, there is only a very slow movement towards, respectiv...","[{""country"":[""Ethiopia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Yet the slowdown in economic growth and in particular of productivity,see Conrad and Wastl (1995),suggest a stronger and negative influence in particular if one accounts for the fortunately very low energy prices that accompanied the ambitious goals of environmental policies in the late 1980s and the 1990s. This paper attempts to explain this apparent difference. In particular it will be shown that environmental policies,here investigated for pollution charges,call for a modification of incentives such that the power of optimal incentives is reduced to which workers will respond with less effort. This friction,which may add up to significant numbers for the economy at large,is neglected in both the theoretical literature and in the application of CGE-models. Accounting for this friction and the empirical evidence so far suggests to take the optimistic findings concerning the consequences of environmental policies on economic growth at least cum grano salis.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, this adaptive approach to computer-based training has yet to come into wider usage for domains that are less well defined or where student-system interactions are less structured, such as during scenario-based simulation and immersive serious games. In order to address how to expand the reach of adaptive training technology to these domains, leading experts in the field present their work in areas such as student modeling, pedagogical strategy, knowledge assessment, natural language processing, and virtual human agents. Several approaches to designing adaptive technology are discussed for both traditional educational settings and professional training domains.

The rapid commercialization of the press, together with an increase in literacy and political consciousness, has led to swift growth in the newspaper market but also changed the way news makers mediate politics. Positioned at a historical junction where India is clearly feeling the effects of market liberalization, this study demonstrates how journalists and informants interactively create new forms of political action and consciousness. The book explores English and Hindi newsmaking and investigates the creation of news relations during the production process and how they affect political images and leadership traditions. It moves beyond the news-room to outline the role of journalists in urban society, the social lives of news texts and the way citizens bring their ideas and desires to bear on the news discourse. This important volume contributes to an emerging debate about the impact of the media on Indian society. Furthermore, it convincingly demonstrates the inseparable link between media related practices and dynamic cultural repertoires.

The aim of this study is to explore new insight from a growing body of research which is investigating SCF issues in China, an evolving transition economy. A content analysis on a review of 151 Chinese-written SCF papers from 2004–2014, based on a sample of 45 leading Chinese journals (Chinese Social Science Citation Index, CSSCI) was conducted from three perspectives: topical coverage, theoretical application and methodological inquiry. The study reveals that the research stream of SCF in China has emerged and evolved to a considerable extent. However, the SCF phenomenon in China is not exactly the same as “SCF” as it is perceived in the mature economy, which is articulated in mainstream SCM English literature. The Chinese business context in which SCF has been implemented has played a dominant role in initiating, affecting and even shaping SCF. This study represents the first endeavor in the field of SCM. It diffuses the Chinese-written SCF research in mainstream SCM English literature.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In thinking about the future of this sys- tem, it is instructive to examine the German experience. The German health insurance system is almost entirely organized and financed around the labor market. In recent years, the German labor market has changed in several ways. Among other changes, more German women now work, the proportion of retirees in the population has increased, the share of manufacturing in employment has declined, and the economy has become more open. These labor market changes have made it more difficult to organize health insurance around employment in Germany. Recent changes in the Ger- man health insurance system have, to some extent, decoupled health insurance from employment. This decoupling is likely to continue as the labor market changes further. We explore the implications of this experience for the United States.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Its importance appears especially when it is manifested as a theoretical approach, as an analytical category and as a new practice of economic and political organisation in the regional level and in the same way in the international aspect as well. Although studiers concede that the world is going towards larger units of integration in global level, however, regionalisation (neo- regionalisation) is becoming a new identity for people in the 21 st century. This is valid especially for the European societies and states aiming to be part of the supranational structures of the European Union. In relation to this, the study below is focused on new integrating practices in Europe, which is known as “Neo-regionalism” in order to see how this new practice is influencing in intensifying the regional cooperation. To make the study even more concrete, a concentration in case study has been made in regional cooperation within CEFTA with a particular focus in its implications towards Kosovo and vice versa.

The discussion is first placed within the methodological debate over the analytic operations that are required for an adequate understanding of authoritarian violence, explaining why a psychoanalytic perspective is necessary. The focus then shifts to Fromm’s take on the Freudian concept of narcissism, before proceeding to explore in some depth his account of the symbolic mechanisms and contextual climate that must combine in practice in order for narcissistic energies to be channeled into authoritarianism and violence. Attention in this regard is paid both to the populace and governing elites. The article concludes with a short exposition of Fromm’s notion of benign narcissism, from its specific content to the conditions of its possibility. Cet article offre une evaluation bien disposee de la conceptualisation du narcissisme selon Erich Fromm et du rapport de cette notion a l’emergence, la nourriture et la resolution de la violence autoritaire. L’analyse est d’abord situee dans le debat methodologique sur les operations analytiques requises pour une comprehension adequate de la violence autoritaire, en expliquant pourquoi une perspective psychanalytique est necessaire. Le point d’attention puis se deplace a l’approche du Fromm sur le concept Freudien du narcissisme, avant de proceder a explorer en quelque detail son explication des mecanismes symboliques et du climat contextuel qui doivent combiner en realite afin que les energies narcissiques soient acheminees au autoritarisme et a la violence. A cet egard, d’attention est donnee a la fois a la populace et aux elites gouvernantes.

Many software and internet environments support and expand – both in terms of quantity and of quality – the space of dialogue. In this paper it is contended that while building knowledge the «builder», the Self is also built.

We propose an analytical model to study under which circumstances self-enforcing agreements can align incentives. Our setup allows to distinguish between a fast and a slow shift and between a smooth or a sudden shift in ownership. We show that the shorter the expected duration of the transition, the higher the total equilibrium exploitation rate. Similarly, a sudden shift implies—by and large—more aggressive non-cooperative exploitation than a gradual shift. However, a self-enforcing agreement without side-payments is more likely for a sudden than for a smooth shift. Further, the scope for cooperation increases with the expected duration of the transition, and it decreases with the renewability of the resource and the discount rate. Most importantly, we show that concentrating on in-kind transfers can be very detrimental for shifting renewable resources: In some cases, there is no efficient bargaining solution without side-payments, even when there are only two players.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In particular, it sought to focus on the transfer of innovation in continuing university education, with particular emphasis on the development and delivery of online higher education courses throughout rural Iceland (i.e., outside of Reykjavik). The partners concentrated on how knowledge and experience about distributed and distance learning models could be transferred between the partner countries and how such models can be integrated into the education system to better support higher education and lifelong learning. There was a particular interest in the practical use of open educational resources (OER) for course design and in the sharing of these course modules among university partners. Some good practice and lessons from OER use in course creation are listed.","[{""country"":[""Iceland""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In addition, intergroup relations tend to be affected by polarized narratives about the past that inhibit the positive consequences of ingroup contact. In this article, we examined the effects of a contact intervention containing narratives of moral exemplars on reconciliation processes in the postgenocide setting of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Results from our 2 studies showed significant positive changes after the contact interventions that highlighted and focused on documented stories of individuals (moral exemplars) saving the lives of their adversaries. We found that focusing on moral exemplars increased reconciliatory beliefs due to enhanced forgiveness. The second study confirmed the positive effects of such interventions on more specific affective, cognitive and behavioral aspects of reconciliation among both former victims and perpetrators. We discuss the importance of the historical narratives used in intervention programs in postconflict settings and draw practical implications from our results.","[{""country"":[""Bosnia and Herzegovina""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This paper compares two types of RM pricing models (non-redeemable RM and redeemable RM), under taking account of borrowers’ uncertain expectation. Through theoretical analysis and empirical simulating results, we believe that because of borrowers’ strong tendency of heritage motivation, and unstable expectation on life expectancy or house value’s volatility, non-redeemable RM with endogenous instability is not suitable for implementation in China, which can explain the failures of some tries similar to non-redeemable RM in China recently.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this paper, we look at the work on the international and European monetary system of Alexandre Lamfalussy, its first president. Lamfalussy pursued a threefold career: as a private banker, a central banker and an academic. Partly under the influence of Robert Triffin, Lamfalussy soon became interested in international monetary issues. This paper analyses his views on the international monetary system and on European monetary integration, including his contributions to the Delors Report, which provided the framework for European monetary union. The paper draws extensively on archival research in the Lamfalussy papers at the Bank for International Settlements and the minutes of the EEC Committee of Governors' meetings. The paper provides not only an analysis of Lamfalussy's thought on European monetary integration, but also offers crucial insight into the Weltanschauung and way of thinking of European central bankers in this period.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Ultimately, in defining “ongoing emergency,” this paper borrows from earlier Supreme Court rulings in the Fourth Amendment context. For purposes of the Confrontation Clause, this paper defines “ongoing emergency” the same way the Court has previously defined “exigent circumstances”: a situation in which “there is an imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that evidence will be immediately destroyed” for the purpose of hindering future prosecution, “or that a suspect will escape.” This definition is relied upon in part because it is offered, in dissent, by Justice Ginsburg, a vocal critic of the Court’s apparent retreat from Crawford. It is also relied upon, in part, because it seems to stand up to most situations in which officers might obtain statements from a declarant not solely for the purpose of preserving testimony for future prosecution. This paper also prescribes a flexible totality of the circumstances test that courts can apply in ascertaining whether the facts surrounding a declarant’s statement(s) do, in fact, constitute an emergency. This test places great emphasis on whether the facts create a situation in which the declarant’s statement bears sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant admission.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This paper examines leadership-productivity nexus using Nigeria as a focal point. This paper reviews critically the concepts of leadership and productivity. It examines the various theories of leadership as well as other empirical works on the subject matter. Further, it explores the various meanings of productivity, how it is measured, factors that affect it and some benefits associated with productivity improvement. In discussing leadership-productivity nexus, the paper argues that situations usually determine the leadership style that may be applied to motivate higher productivity among employees in work organisations. The paper posits that due to poor style of leadership, productivity of workers in both public and private sectors has remained dismal. However, this is not surprising considering the fact that work organisations are the microcosms of larger Nigeria society in which poor political leadership has deprived the nation from transforming from a poverty stricken country to a more prosperous and buoyant one. The paper, therefore, argues that unless there is effective and focused political and organisational leadership and virile followership both at the organisational and national levels, the vision of improved productivity in work organisations and national development will remain a mirage Keywords : Leadership, productivity, leaders, work organisation, national development.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Investment in outside options is a prime example of such opportunism and often leads to inefficiency, for example by exerting effort to search for alternative business partners even if it does not add trade value. We experimentally investigate a bilateral trade relationship in which standard theory assuming self-regarding preferences predicts that the seller will be better off by investing in the outside option to improve his bargaining position. The seller’s investment, however, might negatively affect the buyer’s other-regarding preferences if the investment is viewed as opportunistic. We find overall support for our hypotheses that arise from the link between other-regarding behavior and opportunism. Our findings suggest that when the transaction cost economics approach is applied to the design of a governance structure, other regarding preferences, if relevant, should be taken into account.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The predictive power of logistic regression, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, Bayesian learning multilayer perceptron neural network, least-squares support vector machine, naive Bayes, and tree-augmented naive Bayes classification is contrasted. For most of these algorithm types, we report on several operationalizations using alternative hyperparameter or design choices. We compare these in terms of mean percentage correctly classified (PCC) and mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve using a stratified, blocked, ten-fold cross-validation experiment. We also contrast algorithm type performance visually by means of the convex hull of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves associated with the alternative operationalizations per algorithm type. The study is based on a data set of 1,399 personal injury protection claims from 1993 accidents collected by the Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts. To stay as close to real-life operating conditions as possible, we consider only predictors that are known relatively early in the life of a claim. Furthermore, based on the qualification of each available claim by both a verbal expert assessment of suspicion of fraud and a ten-point-scale expert suspicion score, we can compare classification for different target/class encoding schemes. Finally, we also investigate the added value of systematically collecting nonflag predictors for suspicion of fraud modeling purposes. From the observed results, we may state that: (1) independent of the target encoding scheme and the algorithm type, the inclusion of nonflag predictors allows us to significantly boost predictive performance; (2) for all the evaluated scenarios, the performance difference in terms of mean PCC and mean AUROC between many algorithm type operationalizations turns out to be rather small; visual comparison of the algorithm type ROC curve convex hulls also shows limited difference in performance over the range of operating conditions; (3) relatively simple and efficient techniques such as linear logistic regression and linear kernel least-squares support vector machine classification show excellent overall predictive capabilities, and (smoothed) naive Bayes also performs well; and (4) the C4.5 decision tree operationalization results are rather disappointing; none of the tree operationalizations are capable of attaining mean AUROC performance in line with the best. Visual inspection of the evaluated scenarios reveals that the C4.5 algorithm type ROC curve convex hull is often dominated in large part by most of the other algorithm type hulls.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

From these eleven common terms, a trader has to choose the Incoterm that is most appropriate for the specific transaction he wishes to engage in. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) encourages the use of ‘multimodal’ terms (FCA, CPT, CIP, etc.) instead of the ‘maritime’ Incoterms (FAS, FOB, CFR and CIF). According to the ICC, maritime terms are not appropriate, and thus should not be used in container trade, as the seller does not ‘deliver’ the container on board the vessel, but most often hands over the goods to the carrier at an inland point or terminal. This paper intends to examine the underlying rationale behind this advice. Furthermore, this paper intends to provide support for traders, proposing criteria that might be applied to choose the right Incoterm. It will thereby take into consideration how the transport mode influences and sometimes even imposes the choice for a particular term.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This increase is likely to continue as multinational corporations look for new markets and profitable opportunities to serve or produce abroad. The growth of FDI in the region calls for a search of the different antecedents of U.S. FDI inflows into Latin America. Knowing the different antecedents of FDI in the region is beneficial at a time a diversity of trade agreements are taking place while others wait for official signatures. A movement towards bilateral and multilateral trade agreements includes the U.S. The U.S. has come to play an important role in terms of expanding the horizon of what would constitute the free trade area of the Americas (FTAA). This study investigates the antecedents of U.S. FDI into Latin American countries, while paying special attention to the relationship between trade agreements and FDI inflows. This study also investigates concern for the foreign exchange market as a source of uncertainty to FDI. The empirical investigation uses a fixed effects panel data model to maximize degrees of freedom and to control for cross-country and inter-temporal heterogeneity.","[{""country"":[""Latin America & Caribbean"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As nations move farther and farther away from the era of authoritarianism, we might naturally assume that the influence of those regimes would dissipate as well. The books under review here arrive on our shelves two decades or more since many of the countries of the region recovered their democratic practices. It would be convenient to say that the mere passage of time has erased painful memories of the repression, rendered militaries less politically influential, and given democratic institutions time to congeal. It would also be wrong. It turns out that memories cannot be easily erased, even less so for the families of victims who have never recovered the bodies of their loved ones or have never had their day in court. Military institutions vary in influence but remain relevant, at times interventionist, and have to be dealt with. Progress toward institutional consolidation can be found, but many democracies are still struggling, and some are in serious trouble. For these reasons alone, these three books are timely and relevant. Still, it would be a mistake to attribute their relevance to the conventional notion that the past matters solely because democracies suffer under the weight of authoritarian carryovers.

However, users’ drivers and motivation of the adoption of voluntary open-ended technology has been understudied. It is not clear why users would choose to adopt a new voluntary technology and how and why its use options and possibility unfold. In this paper these questions are examined through the analysis of a longitudinal case study (1994-2012) of telemedicine adoption in a northern Swedish county. The findings reveal that it is not sufficient to make an open voluntary technology available for its users, or passively demand them to use the technology. Successful use would occur through a continuous interplay between users’ technology mental models and their organisational setting and work practices. When in contradiction with the latter, users would not consider the system and hence its use could fade away. Institutional entrepreneurs who have the ability to imagine new and different possibilities and encourage organisational members to experiment and explore possible use and benefit from the technology could influence the initial mental model.","[{""country"":[""Sweden""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It particularly looks to highlight the operational co-production of heritage and tourism and shows that tourism has never worked better, faster and more efficiently as a heritage-producing machine than in this beginning of the 21st century. We are on the threshold of a new “heritage regime”, which presents a gap compared with the one that produced the major European national heritages in the State-Nations of the 19th century. The tourism system (tourism actors, places and businesses as well as tourists themselves) contribute to the production of a new heritage system (heritage places, practices and actors) which functions according to its own needs and expectations, in a world of free traffic, transactions and generalized mobilities.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A crucial component of public expenditures, social expenditures play an important role in the economy as they directly and indirectly affect the distribution of income and wealth. Social expenditures aim at reallocating income and wealth unequal distribution. These expenditures comprise cash benefits, direct in-kind provision of goods and services, and tax breaks with social purposes.The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between political structure, i.e. government fragmentation, ideological composition, elections and so on, and the social expenditures in Greece. Employing data from the Comparative Political Dataset (CPDS) and the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX), a time series analysis was conducted for Greece for the 1980-2014 period. The findings of the study indicate that voter turnout, spending on the elderly population and the number of government changes have positive and statistically significant effects on social expenditures in Greece while debt stock and cabinet composition have negative effects.","[{""country"":[""Greece""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A comprehensive inductive reading of these documents reveals that legal and policy issues were often raised or confronted in the course of resolving technical problems. In many of these instances, the technical decisions that resulted had law-like effects in the sense that they constrained or enabled the ways in which users can communicate and can access and use information over the Internet, whether or not such decisions supported or subverted legal decision-making, and whether or not legal decision-makers understood the societal implications of the technical decisions that were being made. This is one of the two ways in which technical and legal decision-making have become interpenetrated. The literature on legal engagement with problems generated by the technical features of the Internet is vast. This article appears within the nascent literature on technical engagement with legal problems. It does so in an effort to contribute to the building of a shared epistemic and decision-making space that involves both the technical and the legal communities.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Probably one of the bigger and more fundamental changes is the rise in the pension eligibility age. The fact that these reforms came quickly after the closing of early retirement opportunities urged the pre-pension cohorts to adjust their retirement outlooks. This research studied older workers’ emotional reactions to reforms that induce them to extend their working lives with a number of years. Using data from a large scale sample survey among 6,800 older workers in the Netherlands, aged 60–65 at time of interview in 2015, we examined why the pension reforms trigger stronger emotional reactions in some individuals than in others. We integrated theoretical insights from the theory of emotion and the resource-based perspective on retirement adjustment. Testing our hypotheses revealed that emotions are stronger among individuals that have less access to resources. Anger and worry is more prevalent among older workers in more demanding jobs, with less favorable personal (health, wealth) and social resources (no partner support). This research suggests that policy makers—mostly higher level professionals who are much less exposed to the challenges of working longer—have underestimated the psychological and social impact of the reforms on vulnerable groups of older workers and, in particular, less educated older workers with lower social status.

The parliamentary Health Committee report–‘Childhood obesity – brave and bold action’–recommended evaluating extension of NCMP measurements to include younger children. We used longitudinal data, unavailable from NCMP, from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) to evaluate two additions to the current NCMP schedule: a preschool measurement at age three years, and a primary school measurement at age seven years. We hypothesised that these would achieve earlier detection of children at risk of obesity at later ages, and that parental concern about their child’s future risk of overweight would be greatest among parents of obese children. Methods MCS children’s heights and weights were measured, and their parents interviewed, at ages three, five, seven and 11 years. We included data for 14 789 singletons (51.0% boys) seen at age five whose height, weight and BMI values met NCMP criteria. We imputed missing height and weight measurements, calculated BMI and estimated obesity prevalence using UK90 clinical cut-offs, weighted for survey design (Stata: Release 14). We calculated prevalence rate ratios (PRR) to examine associations between parental concern about their child’s future risk of overweight, reported at the age five interview, and child’s obesity at age five years. Results At three, five, seven and 11 years respectively, 1009 (6.6%), 1010 (6.4%), 1153 (7.5%) and 1772 (11.8%) children were obese. A preschool measurement would identify 79.6% (95% CI: 76.3, 82.4) of obese five year-olds as overweight (28.6%) or obese (51.0%) at age three, and an additional primary school measurement 68.1% (64.4, 71.4) of newly obese 11 year-olds (i.e. not obese at age five) as overweight (39.0%) or obese (29.1%) at age seven. At the age five interview, 66.6% (63.1, 69.9) of parents of obese five year-olds reported concern about their child’s future overweight risk compared to 22.3% (21.4, 23.2) of parents of healthy-weight five year-olds (PRR: 2.94; 95% CI: 2.69, 3.20). Conclusion Extension of the current NCMP schedule to include younger children would achieve earlier identification of those at risk of obesity at later ages in primary school. At age five, parental concern about their child’s future overweight risk is strongly related to their child’s current obesity status. Further work is needed to understand parental views about, and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of, options to extend current programmes.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The results suggest that SAMFA is capable of identifying hotspots of higher material and energy use to support targeted planning initiatives, while its ability to visualise different policy scenarios supports more effective multi-stakeholder engagement.

Helping cooperators to mix assortatively is believed to reinforce the rewards accruing to mutual cooperation while simultaneously excluding defectors. However, the relationship between endogenous partner selection, assortativity, and cooperation has been largely unexplored experimentally. Here we report on a series of human subjects experiments in which groups of 24 participants played a multi-player prisoner's dilemma game where, critically, they were also allowed to propose and delete links to players of their own choosing at some variable rate. Over a wide variety of parameter settings and initial conditions, we found that endogenous partner selection significantly increased the level of cooperation, the average payoffs to players, and the assortativity between cooperators. Even relatively slow update rates were sufficient to produce large effects resulting in cooperation levels over 80%. Subsequent increases to the update rate still had a positive, although smaller, effect. For standard prisoner's dilemma payoffs, we also found that assortativity resulted predominantly from cooperators avoiding defectors, not by severing ties with defecting partners, and that cooperation correspondingly suffered. Finally, by modifying the payoffs to satisfy two novel conditions, we found that cooperators did punish defectors by severing ties, leading to levels of cooperation approaching 100% which persisted for longer.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Implications for human security","For the past five decades, unimaginable petrodollar has accrued to Nigeria through the exploitation of oil and gas. Undoubtedly; this to a large extent has emboldened the economic profile of the country, especially in the 1970’s when it was described as a boom. It was this high economic pedestal that propelled the country to become an important continental player even in the West African sub-region. More important is the emergence of a nouveaux riche whose claim to affluence is traceable to emphatic link with the oil and gas industry. Regrettably, the region where this wealth is derived is wallowing in ash-mouthed poverty. As the Sir Henry Willink Commission of 1958 declared, it is ‘backward, neglected and poor’. Majority of the people that inhabit the place are not only existing below the bread line level, but denied of lifesaving amenities. This paradox is an obvious reflection of official misgovernance, ‘confusion of Agendas’ and leadership dysfunctionalism. The focus of this paper, therefore is to demonstrate that the lingering poverty in the Niger Delta region has greatly engendered a drastic decline in the human security of the people. The aftermath is the grim struggle for survival, erosion of ethical standards and Juvenal delinquency. With analytical method which include a review of relevant literature on the Niger Delta including official findings and statements, the paper discovered that there is a discernable nexus between the poverty in the region and lack of human security. The paper concludes by suggesting that the Hobbesian existence in the region can only be mitigated with a conscious National Policy by officialdom to reduce the incidence of poverty, ensure an accountable governance, and herald an ethical leadership. This is the panacea for peace and human development in the troubled Delta.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In these cases, development 'should not' occur and observers tend to recommend government policy reform. The World Bank ranks India 116th out of 155 countries according to the ease of 'doing business'. Indian managers spend a great deal of their time dealing with government regulations and bureaucracy. However, despite these difficulties there has been an explosion of technology-based entrepreneurship in India's software and IT industries. In theory, the Indian software industry 'should not' have developed in the way it did. This paper shows how Indian software entrepreneurs overcame institutional barriers to development and how they themselves initiated institutional change, despite Government's restrictive policies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Indian software firms were able to circumvent government imposed restrictions to growth and lead institutional reform in India. If India's entrepreneurs can do it perhaps others can too.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Literature review shows inadequate understanding of lagged effects, which raises methodological and theoretical issues with the current quantitative studies of democracy. Using country-years as a unit of analysis, the author estimates a series of OLS PCSE models for each predictor with a systematic analysis of the distributions of the lagged effects. The second set of multiple OLS PCSE regressions are estimated including all three independent variables. The results show that economic development, education, and gender have three unique trajectories of the time-delayed effects: Economic development has long-term effects, education produces continuous effects regardless of the timing, and gender equality has the most prominent immediate and short term effects. The results call for the reassessment of model specifications and theoretical setups in the quantitative studies of democracy.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The results of this study were as follows. 1) The results of the factor analysis and the reliability test on ethical consumption consciousness for high school students clearly showed factorial structures including Pro-envi- ronmentalism, Animal welfare, Social responsibility, and Recycling. 2) Analysis of the differences in the means of ethical consumption consciousness, knowledge, and behaviors of respondents between pre-test and post-test revealed that post- test means of all research variables after application of the education program were higher than pre-test means. 3) The ethical consumption knowledge had important medicating roles in the relationship between ethical consumption con- sciousness with regard to clothing and general ethical consumption behaviors. Overall, the study provides empirical evi- dence to support the notion that there is a need for applying an ethical consumption education program to lead adolescents to consume ethically.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, few studies measuring native-speaker attitudes towards both L1 and L2 English have been conducted, including amongst UK-born students. This is surprising in light of recent internationalisation policies adopted by many UK universities and the resultant increase in overseas students. The present study utilises implicit and explicit attitude measures to investigate 194 students’ perceptions of six English speech varieties. The results demonstrated that whilst explicit attitudes towards linguistic variation were generally favourable, when presented with speech samples, listeners’ implicit evaluations of UK English varieties were significantly more positive, on both status and solidarity dimensions, when compared to forms of Asian English. The findings are discussed in relation to the internationalisation agenda within UK universities and the methodological investigation into the relationship between explicit and implicit attitudes towards language variation.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The opponents of in-school marketing are discussed, such as health and psychological problems and the social functions of school.

Non-trivial cases involve individuals that enter the simulation with a history of previous outcomes. We show that the simple solutions of attributing to these individuals a null effect or a random draw from the estimated unconditional distributions lead to biased forecasts, which are often worse than those obtained neglecting unobserved heterogeneity altogether. We then present a first implementation of the Rank method, a new algorithm for attributing the individual effects to the simulation sample which greatly simplifies those already known in the literature. Out-of-sample validation of our model shows that correctly imputing unobserved heterogeneity significantly improves the quality of the forecasts.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The qualitative analysis, consisting of an extensive literature review and two case studies conducted in six major, globally-relevant Brazilian companies, led to the development of an initial model. This model was refined during the quantitative stage that involved 38 executives from large national companies. IT was found to be one of the main drivers of SCG influencing companies' supply chain performance. The final model consists of 5 constructs and 26 elements. Regarding the SCG constructs: (a) a new element 'formal contracts', emerged in the 'contractual SCG' construct; (b) the element 'cooperation' was not confirmed in the 'relational SCG' construct; (c) the element 'transparency' was considered an important element in the 'transactional SCG' construct. Five new elements emerged in the 'IT investment' construct. Market aspects were highlighted as being relevant in the 'supply chain performance' construct. Thus, the model includes elements that can be analyzed in order to shed light on how IT investments influence SCG and supply chain performance.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, science communication is still not part of the formal education of researchers. We organized a pioneering workshop in Portugal, Comunicar Ciencia (‘Comunicating Science’), at the Gulbenkian Institute of Science (10-12 September 2003). In this workshop, 17 Portuguese scientists, from PhD students to heads of research institutes, experienced a plethora of practical exercises organised by journalists and science communication experts from Portugal and the UK. Summary and follow-up evaluations show that scientists feel more confident in their communication skills and ability to participate in activities after the workshop. This work suggests that when targeting the right people, a small, low budget activity, such as this science communication workshop, can improve the participation of scientists in science communication activities.","[{""country"":[""Portugal""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The study was conducted in conjunction with Lutheran Social Services of Minnesota, a religiously affiliated social services charity. The field experiment has three main treatments: a baseline with no subsidy, a rebate to donors of a portion of their contribution to the charity, and an equivalent matching contribution. Within each subsidy treatment there are two rates of subsidy: 20 and 25 percent rebates and 25 and 33 percent matches. We report results that for the most part validate prior laboratory experiments. These results suggest that replacing the current tax rebate system with a matching program of equal cost could increase total giving to charitable organizations.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Yet we intuitively and perpetually make arbitrary demarcations among the past, the present, and the future. Parallel to one’s memory of one’s lived early childhood experience, our collective memory of the past — especially the remote past — can be hazy, indefinite, and surrealistic. Just as one’s present state of mind shapes one’s understanding of one’s early childhood experiences, contemporaneous ideologies can circumscribe historical inquiries into the collective past. Thus, teaching about the past is always a value-laden inquiry. As Ann Chinnery is keenly aware of the interconnections between the aims and the methods of teaching about the past, she argues that teaching about the past must foster critical historical consciousness so learners may apprehend and appreciate difficult knowledge from the past. To Chinnery, cultivating critical historical consciousness differs from “a cognitive, knowledge-based approach” to recollecting the past. More specifically, Chinnery, in line with Emmanuel Levinas and Roger Simon, acknowledges and affirms that one’s “here and now subjectivity” has always been interwoven with the past at both individual and collective levels. Drawing from her teaching experience, Chinnery further concludes that cultivating critical historical consciousness need not rely upon personal testimony. Instead, teaching and learning about the past should focus on facilitating learners’ undertaking critical contextual inquiries into the formation of subjectivity and public policies. Such critical inquiries, while disquieting, can lead to recognizing our ethical responsibilities of “receiving the past” and “shaping the future.”","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Specifically, I critically investigate the intersecting social and medical elements of responses to bodies perceived as too thin and otherwise lacking in physical ability, using my own experiences of living and aging with cystic fibrosis (CF) as a case example. In these explorations, I center gendered identity and its intersection with disabling physical illness. I do so by using my own lived experiences as autoethnographic anchor points to guide critical review of key concepts from the nexus of these two content areas. I focus throughout on exploring how others’ reactions to a frail-looking body often constitute a form of forced gendering via the narratives people attempt to construct for why a person’s body appears that way. The title of the manuscript supports this framework by referencing three cornerstones of patient experience in the CF community: the general trend of patients having salty skin due to the pathology of the disease, a prior embodiment project called Salty Girls (Pettigrew, 2012) that engages this idea, and the more abstract concept of “saltiness” in describing the grit marginalized people display in responding to microaggressions.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The expansion of protected groups and the dismantling of the more overt forms of exclusions has strained the antidiscrimination norm embodied by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As the law expanded the class of protected workers, its redistributive aims grew more pronounced. This chapter of a forthcoming handbook on the economic foundations of labor and employment law and provides an overview of this shift, focusing on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. With each further expansion of the reach of employment discrimination laws, the relation between bias and what may be termed employers’ economically rational discrimination became a more significant part of the case law. This chapter addresses some of the underlying labor economic issues as civil rights laws confront accommodation requirements and redistributive aims.

However the understanding of its adoption as well as the cultural influence remains in its infancy. In recent study, Srite and Karahanna (2006) examined the cultural impact at the individual level and, built upon Hofstede’s framework, conceptualize it as espoused national cultural values, which were proposed to moderating the effects of TAM variables, i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and subjective norms, on IT acceptance. Although insightful, the conceptualization of espoused national cultural values and its impacts requires further validation with subjects from different cultural backgrounds and IT artifacts which may be more subject to cultural influences, e.g., social networking sites. Therefore, this study is aimed to validate and extend the work by Srite and Karahanna (2006) by examining the role of espoused national cultural values in Facebook adoption among Arabic female college students. Considering the cultural differences, we extended the original cultural dimensions in (Srite and Karahanna 2006) to incorporate long-term orientation and also explicate the dimension of collectivism/individualism along two directions, e.g., horizontal vs. vertical. Different from the IT artifacts (PC and PDA) examined in (Srite & Karahanna, 2006), the IT artifact examined in this study is Facebook and its usage may be subject to more cultural influences than using PC and/or PDA, since Facebook involves a lot of social interaction and socialization. A survey study with 200 college female students in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of UAE was conducted to validate the research model. 127 students returned the valid responses. At the moment of data collection, all respondents were new users of Facebook. Data collection involved two stages. The first stage was to collect the response for TAM variables and espoused national cultural values; while the second one, after one week, was for Facebook adoption. Smart PLS was used for data analysis. We expect that the results not only provide further empirical validation of Srite & Karahanna’s theory (2006) with Arabic sample, but also extend the original research by demonstrating complete range of cultural dimensions. Currently, we are in the stage of finalizing data analysis results. By the time of the conference, we shall be able to provide the complete results.","[{""country"":[""United Arab Emirates""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Ideological Alternatives on the EU Dimension","According to the literature on European Parliament (EP) elections, parties do not offer real choices to voters on European integration. Indeed, in most European Union (EU) countries, there has been broad consensus about integration between the main parties. Importantly, previous research shows that this elite convergence is not replicated among the voters. Using European Election Study (EES) data from the 1999 and 2004 Euroelections, this article analyses the ideological dispersion of parties on the EU dimension in the EU member states. We examine the development of inter-party competition on the EU dimension between the two elections, and then test the impact of various factors – divided into public opinion, national party system and EU hypotheses – on the breadth of party positions over integration. The strongest link exists between government size and ideological alternatives, with large coalition governments hindering party competition on the EU dimension. However, overall our hypothesized factors explained only a small portion of between-country differences.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It has been argued that these NPs are syntactic objects, but we provide evidence for their subject status, as in Modern Icelandic and Faroese. Thus, we argue that the syntactic status of the oblique subject-like NPs has not changed at all from object status to subject status, contra standard claims in the literature. Our evidence stems from Old Icelandic, but the analysis has implications for the other old Germanic languages as well. However, a change from non-canonical to canonical subject case marking (‘Nominative Sickness’) has affected all the Germanic languages to a varying degree.

It mines a rich vein of work sustained at Cambridge over many years. Contributors to this work have included Jean Rudduck, Michael Fielding, Donald McIntyre, John MacBeath and Madeleine Arnot. The modes of participation considered include student voice or consultation, students as researchers, participative pedagogy and student leadership. These resonate with the values of the Leadership for Learning (LfL) endeavour (MacBeath & Dempster, 2009) in which shared leadership is a cornerstone. This article explores the relationship between the key concepts of learning, participation and democracy. It draws its analysis from a series of key projects initiated under the umbrella of LfL in Cambridge in recent years, including the „Influence and Participation of Young People in their Learning‟ project (MacBeath et al., 2008), the „Evaluation of the Learning to Lead Initiative‟ project (Frost & MacBeath, 2010) and the „Student Leadership for School Improvement‟ project (Roberts & Nash, 2010). All of these projects have enabled students at a variety of ages to exercise leadership and become full partners in the enterprise of learning. The analysis illuminates the links between the agency of learners, the development of their capacity for leadership and the growth of holistic democracy (Woods & Woods, 2011).","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Recognizing the role of the third sector in the United States, this paper examines the impact of both government and nonprofit sector employment on one’s propensity to volunteer and make charitable donations compared to private sector workers. In addition, many scholars have called for an examination of differences in public service motivation across levels of government, such as Pandey and Stazyk (2008). This paper answers this call by focusing on variances in prosocial behavior across levels of government employment to determine if federal, state or local government workers tend to have higher levels of altruism than workers in other levels of government. This paper draws upon data from the 2008 Volunteer Supplement of the Current Population Survey to examine these issues in assessing the impact sector employment on volunteering and giving charitable donations.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

As such, it would have important distributional effects, first of all from the poor to the rich, but also towards capital intensive industries; and intergenerational, away from the very young (students) and the old. For what concerns long term effects, most studies show that a consumption tax would be moderately more efficient and much simpler than the income tax. Nevertheless with such a tax, the progressivity of the current system could not be replicated. Attempts to mitigate the regressive features of the consumption tax would unavoidably lower the efficiency gains, and significantly increase complexity. I conclude that the passage to a consumption tax has to be done on the basis of a judgement of value (how progressive should our tax system be?), and not based on technical arguments. Shifting to a consumption tax would also imply an extremely complex transition that could be characterised by unemployment and inflation. For monetary policy, monitoring the economy during this transition would be extremely complex. Given the mixed picture that emerges from the analysis, I conclude asking why the consumption tax has taken such an echo in the current debate. May be because it is supposed to serve objectives that are not explicitly stated: either the objective of increasing competitiveness (but then, other tools like the exchange rate seem more straightforward and efficient), or the objective of reducing public spending.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This article inscribes itself in that tradition and offers a micro‐ethnographic analysis of a literacy event in rural Gambia. The incident relates to a letter that was ‘written’ by an old illiterate villager in the process of arranging a family member’s marriage. Although the event in itself is fairly insignificant and trivial, it is mobilised to gain an insight into the social and cultural organisation of literacy and languaging in this village. The old man’s letter is a typical moment of ‘grassroots literacy’ and is not ‘orthographic’ but ‘heterographic’ (reflecting more than one prescriptive regime) and ‘exographic’ (drawing on imported normativity).

It could be termed "" a global crisis "" with victims all around the entire globe. Inadequate information regarding the spread of this global disease could pose a devastating effect on economic growth and social sustainability of the entire world. Therefore, creativity, synergy and collaboration from all sectors of society are required to finding solution to mitigate and curb the widespread. According to UNAIDS (2008) HIV/AIDS is among the greatest challenges to sustainable economic, social and civil society development today; it is a global crisis that undermines all aspects and all sectors of our entire society. No region of the world has been spared; the epidemic remains extremely dynamic, growing and changing characters as the virus exploits new opportunities for transmission. Hence, an effective response demands committed, urgent and sustained action by alliances of individuals, nongovernmental and governmental organizations. Furthermore, an epidemic as complex and as destructive as HIV/AIDS requires innovative and global sensitization. Literature Review Since the discovery of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the causative organism of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 1983, the infection has attained epidemic proportion globally. HIV/AIDS is an extraordinary kind of crisis; it is both an emergency and a long-term development issue. Tumer and Unal (2000) assert that (HIV/AIDS) is one of the most complex health problems of the 21st century. Despite increased funding, political commitments and progress in expanding access to HIV treatment, the AIDS epidemic continues to outpace every global response. Today the AIDS epidemic has become a pandemic disease that is threatening the world population. As the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to spread around the world at an alarming rate, the number of people with this disease is been expected to grow significantly by the end of this decade (ICI 2002). Moreover according to UNAIDS (2006); an estimated 24.7million people are living with HIV/AIDS in sub Saharan Africa. Meyer (2003) claims that HIV/AIDS which is acclaimed the fourth- leading cause of death worldwide is estimated to have claimed 25million lives since the beginning of the epidemic. Acquired immune Deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a viral disease caused by human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that is usually found in body fluids like blood, semen, vagina fluid, and breast milk of infected persons. The virus can be transferred from one infected person to another, mostly through sexual intercourse and sharing of unsterilised instruments like blades, knives, and syringes which had once been used by infected persons. (Olaleye 2003) AIDS has rendered many children orphans, many of which were born with HIV infection. AIDS is killing the most productive people in the population, widening the level of development between developed and developing nations. It is also taking toll on the health sector since a lot of fund is channeled towards HIV/AIDS prevention and control. It has been observed that despite the many programmes organized to inform people about the problem of HIV/AIDS, the rate of it infection continues to be on the increase. (Omoniyi and Tayo-Olajubu 2006) However, Cichocki (2010) Insists that, HIV testing is the first step to take when trying to find out a person's status. Never should one rely on symptoms of HIV to decide whether one is infected. HIV testing is the only way to know for sure. The importance of early diagnosis of HIV cannot be overstated. Decades of HIV and AIDS researches have proven that the earlier HIV is diagnosed, the better the prognosis and the likelihood of a long and healthy life. Meanwhile, certain risk behaviors have been associated with high HIV infection rate. These behaviors according to Anochie and Eneh (2001) are either life style related or health-care provider risk. …","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Natural Gas in Asia is a new edition of a 2002 study on the future of natural gas in the major energy markets of Asia. The 2nd edition has been substantially rewritten and completely updated, and contains two new chapters on South East Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. The future energy needs and environmental problems of China, India and the rest of Asia are considerable. A major question is whether gas supplies can and will respond to expanding demand for the cleanest fossil fuel? Large scale projects will need to be implemented in Russia, the Central Asian Republics and the Middle East to bring required supplies to Asian markets in the years to 2020. This book assesses the economic opportunities, political obstacles and other challenges - both domestic and international - to these projects. In order to succeed, pipeline infrastructure will need to be built over long distances to bring gas to these markets, as well as significant numbers of new LNG terminals. The volume discusses the major current and potential gas markets in Asia: China, India, Japan and Korea, as well as the potential supply of pipeline gas and LNG to Asia from: Russia, Central Asia, South East Asia, Australia and Middle Eastern countries. An important aspect of the next two decades will be the extent to which the region can develop pipeline gas sources to supplement existing large scale LNG imports. The volume also looks at the substantial gas markets emerging in China and India which are at the early stage of introducing large scale natural gas use in cities. These markets face the commercial challenge of developing gas-fired power generation at a cost which may be greater than generation based on domestically produced coal. However, considerations of local air quality and global emissions may give extra value to gas fired generation, as has happened elsewhere in the world.

In this article it tries to analyze and assessed some ways of mainstreaming gender taken place in the Gender and Development Program of Surigao del Sur State University. Objective: It sought to analyze the extent to which GAD has been able to mainstream gender in education, and whether there is a difference between the perception of students and teachers towards the implementation of GAD. Researcher made questionnaire was used. Results: It was found out that the GAD Program was implemented yet it was not a priority concern for the institution, not strictly implemented and institutionalized. Moreover, the result shows a difference between the perception of students and teachers towards GAD implementation. The respondents have proposed solutions that would help in the institutionalization of Gender and Development in SDSSU Cantilan Campus. Conclusion: The Commission on Higher Education has spearheaded a call for partnership among Higher Education in strengthening gender equality, development and peace; and reaffirming their commitment in having gender disparity and women empowerment in the higher education sector. With this, the Surigao del Sur State University must institutionalized the Gender and Development Program to promote equality and equity.","[{""country"":[""Philippines""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Research in this area is dominated by demography and other approaches attempting to “measure” social phenomena within an explanatory framework. Despite its diverse emphasis on materialist, idealist and institutionalist factors, the demographic approach can be criticized for neglecting the interdisciplinary challenge behind the phenomenon. Instead, these approaches operate on the basis of an “equation model of society” that essentially attempts gradually to enhance the illumination of the black box that “contains” the passage of young women to adulthood, leaving them with fewer children born at a later age. While acknowledging the contributions of this research, the article suggests considering the life-course perspective in its full potential as a starting point for an interdisciplinary triangulation of the issue. It argues that a certain life-cours eapproach could supplement the available accounts of causes and consequences with an in-depth analysis of the phenomenon as a “social fact”, studying it in terms of “cultures of postponement” of motherhood.","[{""country"":[""Euro area"",""Europe & Central Asia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a biomarker of acute kidney injury, is associated with iron metabolism. The present study determined the association between serum NGAL and iron status in chronic kidney disease with anemia. A total of 154 adult CKD patients were divided into anemia and without anemia groups. The anemia groups were further subdivided into two groups based on the presence or absence of iron deficiency, defined as a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. The NGAL was measured for all the 154 patients, and the possible relationships with iron status were analyzed. 27.7% patients with TSAT < 20% presented lower hemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, and higher NGAL values than those without iron deficiency. NGAL was inversely correlated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, serum iron, and TSAT. NGAL adequately diagnosed the status of iron deficiency among CKD patients by ROC analysis. The optimal NGAL cutoff value able to identify iron deficiency was found to be > 244.8 ng/mL, with 73.01% sensitivity and 68.29% specificity. CKD patients with anemia presented altered NGAL values as this protein is involved in the maintenance of iron balance. Thus, NGAL might be proposed as a new tool for assessing the iron deficiency and in the management of iron therapy for CKD patients.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We conduct a Heckman two-stage model analysis, using data from listed firms in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange markets in China. The results indicate that: (1) buyers’ CSR performance has a significant and positive effect on long-term M&A performance. (2) Significant differences exist across geographical regions in the links between CSR and long-term M&A performance. In our study, the effects of CSR on long-term M&A performance were positive and significant in a sub-sample of firms located in the eastern region, but the effects were negative and insignificant in a sub-sample of firms located in regions other than in the east. (3) Related-party M&A transactions experience more positive and significant CSR long-term M&A performance linkage, compared to non-related party M&A transactions. Our findings might provide more robust evidence to CSR performance linkage, as we have examined the linkage in a special context of M&A activities, using a Heckman two-stage model to alleviate endogeneity bias. We also bring further insights into the effects of two contingent factors (geographical regions and related-party transactions) on the CSR-performance linkage. The findings of this article suggest that it is reasonable for firms to act socially responsibly when generating economic benefits. Policy makers should consider how to encourage firms to better fulfill CSR through improving the market environment and by enhancing their levels of supervision.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The hidden characteristics are emission intensity and outside option, assumed perfectly correlated, so that the firm has a type-dependent reservation utility. There is mixed ownership to the firm; a fraction is owned by foreigners whose welfare does not enter the home government’s objective function. The home government has a limited set of policy instruments; in fact only net emissions can be taxed. The familiar trade-off between efficiency and rent extraction will involve over-pollution, with (possibly) a subset of the most emission-intensive firm types being induced to relocate. This effect is reinforced by increased foreign ownership, as the cost of leaving rent then increases. (Ownership has no real impact under complete information.) Weaker market power, due to increased competition at the world market, will work in the same direction, but now there is a counteracting effect due to a lower outside option.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As it involves competitiveness, companies aim to produce differentiated economic offerings by reusing and sharing processes, components, information and knowledge ? many times from different domains. However, to be effective, this should be envisaged already when developing the entrepreneurial plan or when assessing the opportunity of extending the business – therefore the need for planning / implementing / integrating several business lines (from various domains). As many of them may look attractive, an effective decision of starting one business line or another should be supported by some tool that allows a systematic assessment of the opportunity of implementing them. This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this respect. The opportunity of developing new business lines is assessed by estimating the mutual impact between them and existing business lines, their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing opportunities. An application example is presented in which an SME in an interdisciplinary domain (covering IT and life-sciences) assesses the opportunity of opening two new business lines.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

A Project of Attention to Diversity from the Performing Arts","Abstract This paper has raised the development of an experience in the framework of professional qualification programmes, in their professional workshop modality, which are implemented outside the formal education schools through local authorities. These students are characterized by cultural diversity, as well as a history of failure and / or dropout, looking for an opportunity of social, labor and educational integration in the last chance so far offered to them by the Education Administration. In this context an innovation project has been developed addressing elements of intercultural education with the support of the Performing Arts. Particularly through the figures of the Clown and the social educator, addressing issues related to the level of participation, acceptance of the activity, classroom climate, interaction with classmates and reflection generated during the implementation of these different activities. Inevitably, results make us reflect on the importance of emotions in the construction of citizenship, and how the feelings of compassion and vulnerability gain importance and allow us to approach “the other” from a life experience, understanding different life projects. Furthermore, this study has allowed us to reconfirm the relationship between ratio profiles of emotional intelligence and social behavior, reaffirming the need of further research that allow us to work on these issues to improve processes of social inclusion.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

These events vary to those associated specifically to the type of surgery performed, to the universal problematic complications of wound dehiscence and localized infection. Surgical site infection (SSI) is costly not only in fiscal terms to the admitting hospital but primarily to the patient in regard to physical and psychological well being, extended length of stay, and repeated, usually painful, dressing changes to the area. Surgical site infections account for 15.7% of hospital-acquired infections in hospital inpatients (Health Protection Agency, SSI prevalence data for 2011),1 and at least 5% of patients undergoing a surgical procedure develop a SSI.2 In 2008, this alone increased the costs of individual patient care by £814 to £6626 depending on the type of surgery and the severity of the infection (overall cost to the NHS exceeds £90 m), a major part of this cost is the extra inpatient bed stay. This has led to an integrated management approach and specific care pathways, which is now at the forefront of hospital prevention plans and includes assessment of wound dressings. ::: ::: The application of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to an operative site is now a commonplace. Negative pressure wound therapy was popularized after reports by Morykwas et al3 and their research on wounds treated by topical negative pressure in animal and clinical studies.4 The standard porous polyurethane foam system was commercialized by KCI (Kinetic Concepts Incorporation, San Antonio, Texas) into the VAC system. Negative pressure wound therapy is a generic technology with wide range of devices available in the commercial market that provide variable topical negative pressure, wound contact layer, and portability. Negative pressure wound therapy has several modes of action on wound beds including angiogenesis, stimulation of growth of granulation tissue,5 evacuation of wound exudate, decreased bacterial bioburden,6 and wound contraction.7 There is a strength of evidence of its clinical efficacy with more than 1000 reviewed publications, so it has become widely used in the management of a variety of surgical beds either to prepare it for further a procedure8,9 or to promote the healing of a definitive procedure.10,11 It is frequently used in circumstances where it is desired to expedite the normal healing process after uncomplicated surgery or after trauma.12-14 ::: ::: In many circumstances, this group of patients can be managed on the short stay admission wards to then enable most of their postoperative recovery in their own home. Advances in surgical technique have helped achieve these goals in the form of minimally invasive procedures, robotics, and better application of local anesthetics to block the operative site foregoing the need for recovery from a general anesthetic.15 The confounding factor is that although the surgery can be done as a day case, the length of stay can be prolonged due to application of a nonportable NPWT device. ::: ::: To compliment this holistic patient episode in the short stay surgical unit, there is the necessity to develop reliable and advanced wound dressings that promote healing, are comfortable to the patient, require minimal changes, and can be totally performed as an outpatient. The use of NPWT in the community is expanding with the advent of smaller, more portable devices. In Bart's Health NHS Trust, we have found obstacles to the use of community NPWT in the past. There has been a combination of reasons for this, including lack of funding and health care professionals’ unfamiliarity with the usage of NPWT devices. The benefits of portable NPWT devices can be clearly seen. In particular, the PICO system retains the benefits of many ambulatory systems with the addition of its own specific advantages. ::: ::: We have found that the PICO system achieves all designated treatment goals and have reviewed patients in our department to assess the overall advantages of the PICO system and the fiscal burden.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The system includes an interceptor for intercepting datastreams from a computer network intended for an application program; a scanner for scanning the intercepted datastream for trigger events, such as cookie data, script commands, and applet programs; and an event response generator for processing detected trigger events. Configuration data is used to identify a response for trigger events such as disabling script commands or programs and deleting or modifying cookie data. The event indicators and an action menu are generated by the event response generator and delivered with the processed datastream to the application program. The application program displays the event indicators so the user is made aware of the trigger events and the action menu allows a user to respond to the detected trigger events. In the preferred implementation, the user may respond by obtaining information about the site which transmitted the datastream having the trigger events and then send e-mail to the administrator of the site. Other actions include modifying the configuration data so subsequent datastreams with the trigger event is passed by the system. Outbound messages from the application program are also intercepted and scanned for trigger events. In the preferred implementation, the configuration data are exchanged between the system and the application program so the user may modify the operation of the system. The configuration data are deleted from the outbound datastream before it is transmitted in the preferred implementation. The system and method of the present invention allow a user to view detected trigger events which otherwise would occur without the user's knowledge and provides the user with sufficient information so the user can make an informed decision as to whether to accept trigger events in a datastream from another site.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Each athlete takes his position. Some intently wait to hear the buzzer; others look toward the stands. A spectator waves her hand at one of the athletes and cheers. A few more seconds pass. Then the buzzer sounds. Most competitors dive in, though the athlete in my lane needs a bit more encouragement. I glance to my right at Amber, the other timer in my lane. Rule one of volunteering at Special Olympics Ohio: Never tell an athlete “go” unless you mean it. Our eyes communicate what we don’t need to say. She and I cry “Go, John!” at the top of our lungs and watch him dive in after his competitors. We laugh as water flies onto our faces and clothing from the splash of his start. John takes off down the lane, inching closer to his competitors on the first lap of his 200-meter freestyle. * * * Modern sport spectators often exist in a liminal space. A story my mother tells about taking me at age three to watch my first local 12-and-under girls’ soccer match captures this feeling. Standing comfortably within my mother’s arms, I was supposedly mesmerized by the game for the first five minutes. When my mother reached for a water bottle, I instantly broke free and ran onto the field, crying, “Dana’s turn! Dana’s turn!” Luckily the girls were able to maneuver the ball around me until the referee called a timeout. Albeit brief, my experience as a spectator positioned me between two opposing desires: passively appreciating the home team and actively joining the fun. According to historian Allen Guttmann, many avid sports fans are in fact athletes themselves, as there is a “strong, positive correlation between active and passive sport participation.”2 Via this model we can begin to understand an organization like Special Olympics. Its motto, “Be a Fan,” speaks to the power, worth, and necessity of spectators in perpetuating the endeavors of the organization.3 The 2008 Swimming Championships of the Special Olympics Ohio Summer Games reminds us of the value of joining in the celebration of the human capacity for excellence, despite possible preconceived notions about competitors with special needs. 4","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For this reason, the intensity of use today on all interurban modes of transport in Spain falls well below that of other EU countries.

Phelps","I. Introduction On March 3, 2006, Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder died while serving a tour of duty in Iraq. (1) After hearing of his funeral, members of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church attended and protested the Maryland ceremony bearing graphic photos and signs declaring ""Thank God for IEDs"" and ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers."" (2) The church members did so in reflection of their religious belief that God has doomed America and its military missions because of the country's tolerance for homosexuality. (3) Following the protest, Matthew Snyder's father, Albert Snyder, sued the Westboro Baptist Church for a variety of civil wrongs, including intentional infliction of emotional distress, (4) thus setting up a conflict pitting free speech against tort liability that ultimately reached the united States Supreme Court. The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, commonly known as IIED, is a relatively new type of civil wrong, and one to which courts have not been terribly friendly. (5) An early problem with IIED was ""the fear that the protection of interests in mental peace of mind would be 'the ""wide door"" which might be opened, not only to fictitious claims, but to litigation in the field of trivialities and mere bad manners.'"" (6) While courts have allowed prosecutions under the tort since its recognition by the American Law Institute in 1948, (7) prosecutions based on speech have been relatively rare. Prior to the Court's decision in Snyder v. Phelps, it had only once, in Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, considered an IIED claim based on speech. (8) The Court in Hustler decided against the plaintiff, using what appeared to be a modified defamation standard, (9) but the decision nonetheless left open a hole in speech jurisprudence. Hustler's plaintiff, televangelist Jerry Falwell, was a public figure, a kind of person the Court in other defamation rulings held to a higher standard than private figures like Albert Snyder. (10) The question remained whether the same IIED standard would apply to both public and private figures. (11) Although Albert Snyder succeeded at the trial level, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled against him. (12) The Court did so because the speech did not target the mourning family (13) nor did it ""in any way interfere[] with the funeral service itself."" (14) The Court did not, however, specify the standard under which Snyder's claim could have been successful. This Note attempts to fill the hole left by the Court's reticence to name an IIED standard for private figures. It argues that the public/private figure distinction on which many relied to dismiss Falwell as a precedent in Snyder is irrelevant in an IIED claim involving speech on a matter of public concern given the nature of the harm at issue. Building on the work of First Amendment scholars Christina Wells and Robert Post, (15) along with a thorough examination of the Court's relevant First Amendment cases, this Note argues that Hustler did not simply import the ""actual malice"" defamation standard into IIED cases involving public figures. (16) Instead, the IIED tort itself demands these elements be added to adequately protect speech on matters of public concern, regardless of the addressee's status. As the Court has long recognized, offensive speech requires significant protection to be free from censorship under community norms. (17) The very nature of the harm in IIED, emotional distress, is simply not capable, without more, of providing protection against such subjective censorship. Ultimately, the Court's standards in Hustler were not simply ""defamation"" standards; they are historically recognized tests necessary under an IIED claim to make potentially protected speech on matters of public concern actionable when made against any individual. II. Facts and Holding Following twenty-year-old (18) Matthew Snyder's death in Iraq, his father, Albert Snyder (Snyder), chose to have his son's funeral service in a Catholic church in their hometown of Westminster, Maryland. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Economic and population growth has driven rapid expansion of material extraction in China, India, and Indonesia since 1980. China and India exhibit patterns consistent with the Jevons paradox, where the economic intensity of extraction (extraction/GDP) has steadily declined while total extraction grew. In Indonesia, extraction intensity grew along with total extraction. In Japan, total extraction remained roughly constant, increasing somewhat in the 1980s and then slowly declining after 1990, while extraction intensity declined throughout the entire period. These different patterns can be understood to some degree by drawing on political-economic and world-systems perspectives. Japan is an affluent, core nation that can afford to import materials from other nations, thereby avoiding escalation of material extraction within its borders. China and India are rapidly industrializing nations that, although increasingly drawing on resources from beyond their borders, still rely on their own natural resources for growth. Indonesia, an extraction economy with less global power than the other nations examined here, exports its own natural resources, often unprocessed, to spur economic growth. The trends highlighted here suggest that in order to avert environmental crisis, alternative forms of development, which do not involve traditional economic growth, may need to be adopted by nations around the world.","[{""country"":[""China"",""India"",""Indonesia"",""Japan""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This focus is generally reflected in an emphasis on local news and the promotion of local concerns, individuals and achievements. The limited literature on country newspapers suggests this emphasis has contributed to country print journalism developing in directions significantly removed from those of contemporary urban journalism. This paper argues that while country newspaper journalism incorporates elements of conventional journalism, it has also evolved in ways which appear to have more in common with non-Western forms of journalism than with the journalism practised in major Australian cities.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Human pregnancy places exceptional energetic, physical, and immunological demands on the mother to accommodate the needs of the fetus, making the woman more vulnerable during this time-period. Here, we examine how metabolic imbalances, infectious diseases, oxygen deficiency, and nutrient levels in pregnancy can exert selective pressures on women and their unborn offspring. Numerous candidate genes under selection are being revealed by next-generation sequencing, providing the opportunity to study further the relationship between selection and pregnancy. This relationship is important to consider to gain insight into recent human adaptations to unique diets and environments worldwide.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The following comments identify some of these. Several proposals amount to measures of constitutionalisation of ICs. Section I identifies some of the hitherto understudied arenas where the authors remind us that the perceived legitimacy of the ICs matters if they are to secure their various objectives. Section II addresses one central standard of legitimacy: the content of the concept of the Rule of Law, which remains contested both as an objective of ICs, and as a requirement on their operation. I stipulate that two central underlying values justify several if not all rule of law norms: non-domination and stable legitimate expectations. Respect for human rights is a further substantive value which many but not all contributors include in the concept. I then consider two main challenges to the legitimacy of ICs from rule of law standards. One is the possible fragmentation and the legal uncertainty that may ensue. Section III thus summarizes the chapters’ insights about the alleged fragmentation wrought by so many ICs. Section IV considers some further challenges to the objectives and performance of ICs by these rule of law standards. Their multiple objectives require that the judges and arbitrators enjoy a wide berth of discretion in interpretation and adjudication – which raise the risk that states and individuals become subject to domination by the ICs themselves. Individuals may end up not living under the rule of law but under the rule of international lawyers. The following two sections gather several possible strands of responses to these fears. Section V elaborates how the power of ICs is constrained by their complex interrelationship with domestic authorities. Some such interdependence may be assessed by a further popular standard of legitimacy in addition to the rule of law, namely subsidiarity. This concept is often invoked in international law, explicitly so for the European Union4 and in debates concerning the European Convention on Human Rights.5 The section explores how several features of the authority of ICs presented by the authors may be explained and perhaps assessed by some standard of subsidiarity, to reduce the risks wrought by the ICs themselves. Appeals to subsidiarity may not so much lay issues to rest as stimulate more structured and systematic arguments concerning the legitimacy of ICs. Section VI considers several ways to regulate the discretion of the ICs to reduce the risks of fragmentation and domination, garnered from the contributions of this volume. Increased legitimacy of international courts requires perspectives and measures of constitutionalisation: Promote rule of law standards by better checks on the international courts, and channel and coordinate them better.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Using backcasting as a policy tool for developing a view of a sustainable energy future, this Chapter aims to explore some of the critical hurdles as the policy makers continue to formulate and advance environmentally friendly energy consumption in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We illustrate the nature of the challenges to reach a wider adoption of alternative energy resources and build on the need for renewal of the energy “delivery” infrastructure through the “smart grid” as a means for transition to a sustainable economy in the longer term. While there is now engagement with the public about a sustainable future, alignment of stakeholders’ economic interests and absorption capacity of emerging technologies remain as the two main challenges in mitigating the underlying systemic hurdles to be overcome. As the public at large realize the need for a future of sustainable energy despite lack of a global consensus about definitive targets, the policy makers may seek to provide a combination of approaches that build on optimal investment incentives in the near-term, liberalization of the electricity grids in the medium term and a dynamic policy framework that induce continuous technological innovation in the longer term. Observing the current responses to the externalities by the policymakers in a number of jurisdictions we articulate such forthcoming initiatives to mitigate the systemic hurdles embedded in the existing energy infrastructure. We also articulate measures to enable deployment of integrative sustainable energy solutions over a transformed infrastructure, namely smart grid.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This new form of Jew-hatred originates in the political and psychological desire to split off, repress, and downplay the memory of the Holocaust because such memory, with which Jews are often identified, evokes unwelcome guilt feelings. As Holocaust memory undermines the uncritical identification with a collective, family, or nation tainted by anti-Jewish mass atrocities, the repression of national guilt may unconsciously motivate the reproduction of resentments that helped cause the Shoah. In this light, the article re-examines the empirical postwar German study Group Experiment and other works of the Frankfurt School. Three specific defensive mechanisms in relation to historical collective guilt feelings are identified that engender a variety of antisemitic projections—from “Jewish power” to “Jewish money” and other anti-Jewish tropes—after the Holocaust. It is argued that these insights into post-Holocaust secondary antisemitism, empirically analyzed in the German context, can partly be transferred to other contexts in European democracies and beyond. This article demonstrates that an unprocessed history of national guilt can have a negative impact on democracy and the resilience of antisemitism.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We estimate a vector autoregession to examine the joint behavior of returns, cash-flow news, and trading between individuals and institutions. Our main finding is that institutions buy shares from individuals in response to good cash-flow news, thus exploiting the underreaction phenomenon. Institutions are not simply following price momentum strategies: When price goes up in the absence of positive cash-flow news, institutions sell shares to individuals. Although institutions are trading in the 'right' direction, institutions as a group outperform individuals by only 1.44 percent per annum before transaction and other costs, because they are extremely conservative in deviating from the value-weight market index.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The proposed model and hypotheses, based on the conformance and performance roles of boards, are tested on a rich sample that includes all banking firms operating in Costa Rica between 2000 and 2012. The results indicate that the negative effect of non-performing loans on ROA is significantly greater in banks with non-performing directorship associated with high rates of unexpected changes in the board. The findings of the study highlight that the competence of boards matters. The results also give evidence of the importance of balancing financial and non-financial goals if superior governance and economic performance are the objectives pursued by organisations.","[{""country"":[""Costa Rica""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Red and white skeletal muscle fibers have very different antioxidant enzyme activities and resistance to oxidative stress. In this paper, we demonstrate that the activity of OGG1 is significantly higher in the red type of skeletal muscle compared with white fibers from old rats. Exercise training resulted in increased OGG1 activity in the nuclei of red fibers and decreased activity in nuclei of white fibers and in the mitochondria of both red and white fibers. The activities of UDG were similar in both red and white muscle fibers. Exercise training appears to increase the activity of UDG in the nuclei and mitochondria. However, exercise training affects the activity of OGG1 in nuclei and mitochondria differently, suggesting different regulation of the enzymes. In contrast, UDG showed similar activities in nuclei and mitochondrial extracts of exercise-trained animals. These data provide evidence for differential regulation of UDG and OGG1 in maintaining fidelity of DNA in oxidatively stressed cells.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The quality of resources, as well as inclusive planning and administration strategies, is beneficial for a strong sense of coherence and good health. However, implementation of HiAP and a Healthy City approach faces challenges regarding the diversity of starting points, political will at higher levels, dependence on strong local engagement, and advocacy and public support. Special attention should be given to establish cross-sector collaboration over time and the need to raise awareness of conditions for good health to achieve HiAP on a local level.

Using electric pacemaker is the most common treatment for the patients with heart conduction problems. The present study aimed to determine the factors affecting survival in the patients undergoing pacemaker implantation in the hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to identify the factors affecting the survival of the patients suffering from arrhythmia. Patients and Methods: This retrospective survival analysis was conducted on all 1207 patients with heart failure who had undergone permanent pacemaker implantation in the hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from 2002 to 2012. The data were analyzed using non-parametric methods such as Kaplan-Meier method, life table, and Cox regression model. The risk factors of mortality were determined using multivariate Cox proportional hazards method. Results: Survival data were available for 1030 (80%) patients (median age = 71 years [5th to 95th percentile range: 26 - 86 years]) and followup was completed for 84.28% of them. According to the results, 56% of the patients had received dual-chamber systems, while 44% had been implanted by single-chamber ventricular systems. Moreover, sick sinus syndrome and pacemaker mode were independent predictors of increased mortality. Conclusions: In this study, sick sinus syndrome and pacemaker mode followed by syncope were independently associated with increased mortality.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

First, it presents the results of a “history-friendly” simulation model of evolution of the pharmaceutical industry. Second, it aims at contributing to a more general methodological discussion about agent-based models by proposing an econometric analysis of the results of the simulations. The case of the pharmaceutical industry has been studied extensively by scholars because, despite the high level of R&D intensity, the industry has been characterized by a relatively low levels of concentration. The model is able to reproduce the main stylized facts of the industry in an evolutionary perspective. In this paper we extend the analysis conducted in two previous works (Garavaglia et al. 2012, 2013) by further qualifying the findings with an extensive econometric investigation of the model outputs. The paper focuses the attention on the determinants of market structure, the innovative performance of the industry, the diversification in multiple submarkets and the level of prices. We find that the properties of the technological and demand regimes are key determinants of the patterns of industry evolution and that the main mechanisms driving the model are the random processes of search, the discovery of new submarkets as well as the interactions between patent protection, imitation and price competition. In addition, this paper emphasizes how the emerging leaders in the industry are those innovative early entrants which entered in large submarkets, showing the importance of the first mover advantage and of the size of the “prize” accruing to innovators when they discover a new rich submarket.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Moreover, mechanistic understanding of the ETH reaction relies heavily on its well-known “sister-reaction” the methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) process. However, the MTH process possesses a C 1 -entity reactant and cannot, therefore, shed any light on the homologation reaction sequence. The reaction and deactivation mechanism of the zeolite H-ZSM-5-catalyzed ETH process was elucidated using a combination of complementary solid-state NMR and operando UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, coupled with on-line mass spectrometry. This approach establishes the existence of a homologation reaction sequence through analysis of the pattern of the identified reactive and deactivated species. Furthermore, and in contrast to the MTH process, the deficiency of any olefinic-hydrocarbon pool species (that is, the olefin cycle) during the ETH process is also noted.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It has been highlighted in different literature that growth experience in the South Asian countries like India or Pakistan during liberalised regime have primarily been driven by the productivity take-off in the traded sectors. This theoretical analysis offers another attempt to predict the implications of technological progress in the traded formal sectors on informal wage, taking into consideration that real wage is a reasonable benchmark to measure the well-being of the economically marginalised people living under informal arrangements. The key model propositions are further exemplified by a sensitivity analysis using plausible ranges of parameter values for India. We also provide empirical evidence using data on twenty-seven Indian States (including one Union Territory) between 1989 and 2010 on informal wages, capital stocks in informal and formal zones and value-additions in the formal segment to substantiate the model prediction on informal wage depicted in our numerical exercise, which shows that the growth in informal wage could reasonably be linked to the productivity surge in the formal sectors, while greater capital accumulation in the informal units over the formal counterparts has further aggravated this upswing in informal wages.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Access to social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, etc.) is transforming the public sphere as vatious sectors (civilsociety, media and the government) figure out how to engage people and create niche networks on these various platforms.

The issuance of CGG was not the first time the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the problem of global inequalities in health. Numerous analysts and advocates have compared CGG to the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata. Some see CGG as a continuation of Alma-Ata; others malign it for paying insufficient attention to the principles, background documents, and lines of action proposed in the Alma-Ata declaration. ::: ::: We might understand the two reports as bookends to 30 years of brutal global capitalism, punctuated by the “lost decade” of the 1980s, the end of the Cold War, and, more recently, the implosion of global finance. This period saw the publication of two seminal neoliberal health manifestos –the World Bank’s 1993 World Development Report and the WHO’s 2002 Commission on Macroeconomics and Health report. Both feature the term “investing in health” in their title, conveying “a double meaning—investing [through “cost-effective,” narrow, technical interventions] to improve health, economic productivity, and poverty; and investing capital, especially private capital, as a route to private profit in the health sector.”","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As a result, how to relieve this pressure and adjust the negative emotions of single people has become a very important issue. Therefore, related healing products that can relax the bodies and minds of single people and provide psychological comfort and a release function are being developed accordingly. In view of this, the purpose of this study is to determine the preference of single office workers with different lifestyles regarding healing products. The lifestyle characteristics and preferences of single office workers were investigated via a questionnaire survey. Through SPSS statistical software, the preference factors of single office workers of different groups regarding different healing products were analyzed, and the lifestyle characteristics and preferences of each group were subsequently obtained. The results show that the lifestyle of single office workers could be divided into three groups. On the whole, single office workers considered healing products to be interesting and impressive with attractive and charming appearances, as well as offer the function of transforming negative emotions. This study hopes that the design principles obtained can provide an important reference for product designers to design relevant healing products for single office workers.","[{""country"":[""Taiwan, China""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Many studies have discussed phenomenological benefits of data to service. However, limited research describes managerial issues behind such benefits, although a holistic understanding of the issues is essential in using data to advance service in practice and provides a basis for future research. The purpose of this paper is to address this research gap. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Design/methodology/approach ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: “Using data to advance service” is about change in organizations. Thus, this study uses action research methods of creating real change in organizations together with practitioners, thereby adding to scientific knowledge about practice. The authors participated in five service design projects with industry and government that used different data sets to design new services. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Findings ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Drawing on lessons learned from the five projects, this study empirically identifies 11 managerial issues that should be considered in data-use for advancing service. In addition, by integrating the issues and relevant literature, this study offers theoretical implications for future research. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Originality/value ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: “Using data to advance service” is a research topic that emerged originally from practice. Action research or case studies on this topic are valuable in understanding practice and in identifying research priorities by discovering the gap between theory and practice. This study used action research over many years to observe real-world challenges and to make academic research relevant to the challenges. The authors believe that the empirical findings will help improve service practices of data-use and stimulate future research.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As the proportion of births occurring outside of marriage remains low in Japan, fertility is still significantly influenced by marriage trends, which are in turn influenced by societal expectations regarding the marriageability of educated women. Previous studies have suggested that the economic independence associated with higher education is at the root of this negative relationship, but how persistent will this relationship prove to be? As women’s education rapidly catches up with men’s, there is reason to suspect that marriage trends are also in transition. This study examines the latest marriage-related behavior patterns among Japanese women from 2002 onward, focusing on the relationship between women’s economic emancipation and marriage in a gender-traditional society. Using a newly available large panel survey on young adults in Japan, it will demonstrate that the effects of women’s education have reversed, and are now in fact positive.","[{""country"":[""Japan""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The legal question of competence that determines the Union’s power to conclude external commercial treaties by itself or, in the alternative, jointly with the member states will be clarified by the CJEU in its forthcoming judgement in Opinion 2/15. We provide an overview of the relevant CJEU case law and the main issues that arose during the Court’s hearing in the Opinion 2/15 procedures; discuss the law and practice of the provisional application of international treaties by the EU and legal avenues that enable the entry into force of a mixed agreement despite its rejection by an individual member state. We argue in favour of adjusting the scope of future EU trade and investment agreements to the realm of EU exclusive competences as clarified by the CJEU to remedy the functional deficiencies of EU treaty-making that were exposed in the ‘CETA-drama’. At the same time, we emphasize the need for – and outline a path towards – a qualitative change in EU and member state institutional practice that fully employs the channels of vertical political participation in the Union’s multilevel governance structures so as to strengthen the legitimacy of EU economic treaty-making.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We make use of all pre-treatment CD4 counts, because analyses using only a single observation at initiation may be subject to biases. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We used data from the CASCADE (Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe) multinational cohort collaboration of HIV-1 seroconverters. We analysed pre- and post-treatment data of patients with seroconversion dates estimated January 2003-March 2014 (n = 7600 for primary analysis) using a statistical model in which the characteristics of recovery in CD4 counts are determined by multiple predictive factors. Secondary analyses were performed incorporating uncertainty in the exact timing of seroconversion to allow more precise estimation of the benefit of very early treatment initiation. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: 'True' CD4 count at cART initiation was the strongest predictor of CD4 count beyond 3 years on cART. Allowing for lack of complete certainty in the date of seroconversion, CD4 recovery was more rapid for patients in whom treatment was initiated within 4 months. For a given CD4 count, higher viral load (VL) at initiation was strongly associated with higher post-treatment CD4 recovery. For other patient and drug characteristics, associations with recovery were statistically significant but small in magnitude. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: CD4 count at cART initiation is the most important factor in predicting post-treatment recovery, but VL provides substantial additional information. If cART is initiated in the first 4 months following seroconversion, recovery of CD4 counts appears to be more rapid.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was a perfect opportunity for America to accomplish this — to raise America's image from the ashes of despair, self- doubt, and low credibility in the world. After the invasion, President Saddam Hussein was ejected out of obscurity into the light of world curiosity and intrigue. Seen as the leader who dared to steal an entire country in daylight, who took hostages and created human shields, and then arrogantly brushed aside the world's outrage, the entire world seemed to want to understand not Saddam's politics, but his mind. As the world threatened Hussein with ejection from Kuwait, he not only grandiosely retorted with threats of burning the entire planet, but became increasingly brazen, emboldened, dangerous, and resolute. Saddam's self organization fuels the “Nebuchadnezzar Imperial Complex,” which operate within the malignant narcissistic paranoid personality. The Iraqi leader's dynamics dovetailed with “Gulf- Nam” — the American post- Vietnam failure syndrome. This study focuses on Saddam's personality dynamics as a violent leader in the Arab world.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

From a technical perspective, we want to be able to ensure the protection of agent state, the viability of agent communities, and the reliability of the resources on which they depend. To accomplish this, we must guarantee insofar as possible that the autonomy of agents can always be bounded by explicit enforceable policy that can be continually adjusted to maximize their effectiveness and safety in both human and computational environments. From a social perspective, we want agents to be designed so as to fit well with how people actually work together. Explicit policies governing human-agent interaction based on careful observation of work practice and an understanding of current social science research can help assure that effective and natural coordination, appropriate levels and modalities of feedback, and adequate predictability and responsiveness to human control are maintained. We see these technical and social factors as key to providing the reassurance and trust that are prerequisite to the widespread acceptance of agent technology for nontrivial applications.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It was aimed at supporting the functioning of financial markets during the crisis and helping the economy recover from the recession by altering both the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These new policy tools came as a last resort when traditional policy tool, such as, the federal funds rate target was already constrained near zero. This new policy tool – called “quantitative easing” – is comprised of (a) lending to financial institutions, (b) providing liquidity to key markets, and (c) purchasing longer-term securities. While the first two were aimed at lowering the short-term lending rates, the third one was aimed at lowering the long-term lending rates. Lowering of the lending rates was expected to raise consumer and business spending and, thereby, stimulate the economy. There have been studies on the effect of this new policy tool on various aspects of domestic and international economies. However, none has evaluated the policy’s effect on U.S. balance of trade. Our study develops a model of the balance of trade, which is a function of domestic (U.S.) and foreign real GDPs, exchange rate of U.S. dollar, and monetary policy (credit easing) dummy. We then empirically test the model on a panel data for the U.S. and BRICS countries over the period, 1995 – 2014, and find that the Fed’s quantitative easing has no effect, whatsoever, on U.S. balance of trade. This finding although seems counterintuitive but is logical. This is because, the BRICS countries’ economic growth is mainly export driven. Therefore, a rise (fall) in their GDP means a rise (fall) in their exports, that is a rise (fall) in U.S. imports from these countries causing a fall (rise) in U.S. balance of trade. This negative effect of BRICS countries’ real GDP on U.S. balance of trade was offset by the positive effect of lowered value of the U.S. dollar – caused by the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing – leaving the U.S. balance of trade unaffected.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Diuretics reduce fluid overload but require residual kidney function to work. Adherence to dietary sodium restriction is generally poor. Here, we review an alternative pharmacologic strategy aimed at reducing sodium absorption from the gut. ::: ::: ::: RECENT FINDINGS ::: Genetic studies implicate the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) as the major absorptive sodium transporter. Pharmacologic inhibition of apically expressed gut NHE3 offers the potential of reducing sodium absorption and fluid overload independent of kidney function and with better safety than systemic drugs. Two small-molecule inhibitors of NHE3 (tenapanor and SAR218034) with minimal systemic exposure reduce urinary sodium and increase stool sodium in a dose-dependent manner in rodents, with similar results observed with tenapanor in humans. These molecules also reduce blood pressure in rat models of CKD (tenapanor) and hypertension (SAR218034). Clinical trials of tenapanor in patients with CKD-related disorders are ongoing. ::: ::: ::: SUMMARY ::: Pharmacologic inhibition of gut NHE3 may be a viable strategy for managing sodium load in patients with CKD or with sodium-sensitive hypertension in general. Ongoing clinical trials will shed further light on the potential benefits of this approach.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The panel was constituted under Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Chinese Government opposed the constitution, admissibility and ruling of the entire arbitration. It has since put forward many counter claims to refute the validity of the decision reached. China’s primary concern inevitably lies with the implications of the decision on the ‘Nine-Dash Line’, a historic graphical boundary line that has appeared in the Chinese national atlas as early as 1914. This article will qualitatively dissect the decisions made by the arbitral tribunal from a historical perspective, taking into account diplomatic correspondences and authoritative theories in public international law. Ultimately, this article aims to ascertain the implications of the arbitral rulings on the claims of sovereignty of both countries, which remain the terminal concern of the international community.

Data were collected through the use of semi structured interview schedule, key informant interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) and analyzed using percentages, mean scores and trend analysis. Only 1.8% of the farmers from Nigeria, 2.5% from Sierra Leone and 0.7% from Liberia possessed special training on climate change adaptation and food security issues. The presence of local collaboration among actors was higher in Nigeria than in Sierra Leone and Liberia. There was nonexistence of overseas linkages with majority (89.0% for Nigeria; 98.0 for Sierra Leone and 96.8% for Liberia) of the farmers across the three countries. The intensity of linkages / collaborations existing among actors in the enterprise domain, in the three countries, outweighs that with other domains, with higher collaborations existing among the small-scale farmers and famers’ associations. However, there was a perceived increase in the trend of linkage between farmers and R & D institutions in Nigeria between 2007 and 2009, with a linkage index of more than 2. There was also an increasing higher linkage index (of more than 2) between farmers and technology delivery institutions in Nigeria than in Sierra Leone and Liberia, but a low linkage index of less than 2 between farmers and policy making bodies for all the countries. Poor generation of innovations over the past ten years and poor domestic support for climate change adaptation and food security in the West African sub-region were identified. The study points to the need to intensify the collaboration efforts, between local and foreign partners, as this will bring about the generation of better and improved innovations on food security and adaptive measures.","[{""country"":[""Liberia"",""Nigeria"",""Sierra Leone""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Most currently available pulse oximeters indicate this flow, but few display it in usable form. Since adequate tissue blood flow is a prerequisite for normal metabolic activity, it is a parameter that should merit a place in standard anesthesia or intensive care monitors. That the peripheral tissue blood flow is not routinely displayed may be in part due to the difficulty in quantifying data obtained: flow is not accurately measured as simply as pressure, even by invasive means. It is in the pattern of the waveform that beat-to-beat changes in stroke volume can be better seen than measured, or in the interaction of ventilation and circulation that tests general circulatory performance. The origin and interpretation of these changes are discussed and illustrated with examples. We indicate how new physiological tests of autonomic function and cardiac preload can be developed using pulse plethysmography. The importance and application of the Valsalva effect on the waveform is emphasized. This effect is particularly applicable for monitoring adequate fluid loading and the action of vasodilator drugs, which are both important in anesthesia. Differences between the arterial pulse pressure wave and tissue flow wave are discussed, as well as the cause of certain artifacts, including the wandering dicrotic notch.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The transition to knowledge based-economy, knowledge plays a governing role in leading the productivity and maintaining the economic performance growth. Equally important would be the factors that would contribute towards the knowledge creation. However, the literature indicates that very little attempts have been conducted to investigate factors that influence knowledge productivity. In Malaysia, the Administrative and Diplomatic Officers or PTD, are heavily involved in the development and implementation of the main policy makers of the federal government. However as to date, there are no mentions of any study exploring knowledge productivity of PTD. Against this background, this study intends to investigate the contributions of job characteristics towards knowledge productivity. In the process, it will propose a framework linking job characteristics and knowledge productivity. The proposed research method that will be employed will be a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The qualitative approach will use interview as the main data collection technique, while the quantitative approach will adopt the questionnaire. The qualitative approach will help the researcher to develop the framework that depicts the factors that contribute towards knowledge productivity among PTD. Based on this framework a questionnaire will be developed so as to collect quantitative data involving PTDs. The contribution of the study can be viewed from two perspectives i.e. theoretical and practical. From the theoretical perspective, the study will develop an empirical based framework while from the practical perspective the study will help to devise strategies for improving and enhancing knowledge productivity. The significant of the study is that, it will further improve knowledge productivity among PTDs who are mainly involved in executing the country's development strategies including strengthening the administrative functions, social infrastructures and also the performance of the country's economic growth in line with the country's National Key Results Area (NKRA).","[{""country"":[""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As a result, they seek to implement proper strategies to maximize capacity and competitiveness. This article asks whether a multinational company in medical devices has the strategic potential to transform its procurement strategy to embrace a local sourcing concept to gain competitiveness while retaining engineering origin. Study results from the medical-device industry show that attributes delivered by German origin can improve competitiveness. A significant majority of customers see the importance in the “Made in Germany” label. Customers also tend to accept the conception of local production that retains German engineering. The medical-device industry represents several branches in areas such as quality and technology. The results of this paper address product marketing, product strategy, and decision-makers dealing with sourcing alternatives. The results suggest that the strategy of pairing local production with German engineering is desirable to enhance competitiveness.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The question addressed in this paper is whether the moral reasoning abilities of Australian and Malaysian accounting students in their final year of study differ because of their cultural upbringing. This study uses primary data collected from 34 final year accounting students (12 Australian and 22 Malaysian) enrolled in an Australian degree program. The test scores collected at the beginning and end of the academic year indicate that culture and other explanatory variables do not have an affect on students' moral judgment. The findings in this study suggest that culture as an independent variable does not influence the way accounting students analyse and resolve ethical dilemmas.","[{""country"":[""Australia"",""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

While the effects on labor force participation of EITC have been thoroughly studied, producing a consensus that the program encourages participation particularly among single women with children, the effect on hours has taken a back seat in most studies. Those who have studied the issue have generally found no effect. A number of those studies, however, were based on a population defined too broadly to indicate anything meaningful for the EITC population, while others seemed to overlook facets of their own data. I include a multiple regression using Current Population Survey Data cases in which family income corresponds to the phase-out range of EITC. Only in the phase-out range â€“ as beneficiaries lose part of their benefits as a percentage of income above the threshold amount â€“ would we expect a negative effect on hours worked. My results show a small negative effect on hours worked for the population in the phase-out range.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To date, the UN has not developed a comprehensive mechanism to investigate and punish such violations. In order to comply with IHL and to uphold the UN’s mission of promoting international cooperation, the UN must establish a clear framework to enforce the law of war within its own peacekeeping and peace enforcement forces. This article will begin with an introduction to UN peace operations, highlighting some cases of alleged abuse. The second section will examine the applicability of IHL to the UN. First, the section will examine the nuances of IHL by describing the differences between international, non-international, and internationalized armed conflict. It will then demonstrate that the UN is bound by IHL. The article will conclude by examining several potential mechanisms to enforce the UN’s obligations under IHL: international state responsibility; domestic proceedings in the troop-contributing state; human rights mechanisms; claims commissions; the International Criminal Court (ICC); and ombudspersons.

It is attracting increasing interest for the production of biopharmaceuticals, due to its capability of performing posttranslational modifications. Traditionally, production processes with P. pastoris describe fed-batch processes based on feed forward regimes with a constant specific growth rate. However, this strategy does not consider physiological changes of the organism, bearing the risk of overfeeding and thus harming the cells. Recently, we introduced the specific substrate uptake rate as a novel physiological parameter to design fed-batch strategies for P. pastoris. We showed that by doing dynamic batch experiments strain specific parameters, which are needed to set up respective feeding profiles, can be easily determined. Furthermore we proved that dynamics during feeding directly affects productivity and product purity. Here, we sum up our findings regarding dynamics in bioprocess development for P. pastoris.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Predominantly, this policy focus has been influenced by Richard Florida’s ‘creative-class’ thesis. For Florida (2002), the future of urban economies revolves around the attraction and retention of the ‘creative class’. Loosely speaking, the ‘creative class’ comprises workers in fields such as the arts, academia, the sciences as well as the legal profession and business management. Florida suggests that in order to remain competitive, cities must promote the type of environment to which the ‘creative class’ is attracted because companies (and highly mobile investment capital) are attracted to where these individuals are located. This environment comprises city centre locations with high-quality amenities, such as bars, restaurants and good quality public space. Given the attraction of the city image projected by the ‘creative-class’ thesis, it has proved popular with city authorities on a global scale, and particularly in North America and Europe (Peck, 2005; Houston et al, 2008; Zimmerman, 2008). While the ‘creative-class’ concept emerged during a period of relative economic prosperity, it has proved a particularly resilient form of policy in the context of the global financial crisis. Indeed, in the example of Dublin, the influence of the ‘creative class’ has, if anything, taken on a greater significance during the economic downturn.","[{""country"":[""Ireland""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It can be mapped on the physical model of directed polymers in random media. We consider the finite-temperature version of local sequence alignment for proteins and study the transition between the linear phase and the biologically relevant logarithmic phase, where the free-energy grows linearly or logarithmically with the sequence length. By means of numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis we determine the phase diagram in the plane that is spanned by the gap costs and the temperature. We use the most frequently used parameter set for protein alignment. The critical exponents that describe the parameter driven transition are found to be explicitly temperature dependent. Furthermore, we study the shape of the (free-) energy distribution close to the transition by rare-event simulations down to probabilities of the order $10^{-64}$. It is well known that, in the logarithmic region, the optimal score distribution (T=0) is described by a modified Gumbel distribution. We confirm that this also applies for the free-energy distribution ($T>0$). However, in the linear phase, the distribution crosses over to a modified Gaussian distribution.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The evolutionary process has brought people together through flows of communication into global digital networks to an extent that scientists have started to talk of the rise of a new geological era called “Anthropocene”. The paper “Programming the State—Digital Technology and Institutional Design” focuses on political aspects of the on-going technological transformation bringing us into a digital society. The aim is to discuss the relation between political and technological change by applying historical institutional theory to explain and understand how ideas and ideology are embedded into digital political institutions. The discussion starts by explaining the basic concepts used in historical institutional theory such as path dependency and formative moments. I then turn to a theory of history formulated by R.G. Collingwood, as this help to understand how the formation of political institutions may be studied in terms of a design process. My argument is that in order to understand the design of political institutions we have to include the study of political ideology since ideologies serve as the design plan for specific institutional solutions. If we are to understand the logic of digitalization we have to be aware of which ideas that are embedded into digital technological solutions. The presentation ends with a discussion on the implications that may be drawn by this argument and whether or not it is possible to turn back from a path once chosen to step upon.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It distinguishes between four sets of rent—gifts of nature; innovation rents; exogenously defined rents; and market power—and three spheres of governance—setting the rules -“legislative governance”; implementing the rules -“executive governance”; and monitoring rules and sanctioning malfeasance -“judicial governance.” The exercise of governance power in GVCs over the generation, protection and appropriation of rents is considered though the lens of four sets of key GVC stakeholders—the corporate sector, civil society organizations, the nation state and supranational institutions. This general analysis is given flesh through three case studies: food-safety standards in GVCs; taxation policies and competition policies. In these sectors, the corporate sector is generally much more effective in governing rent generation and appropriation in the global operations of GVCs than are the three sets of non-corporate stakeholders. From this observation we offer a hypothesis that the capacity of non-corporate stakeholders, including national states, to govern GVCs is contingent upon the extent to which this coincides with the interest of the corporate sector. However, as noted, this balance of power between private and non-corporate actors is a contested terrain and dynamic in nature.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Analysis of curriculum documents from 28 OECD countries, including China and South Africa, reveals that although there is a prevalence of astronomy related content in most grades, incorporating Robotic Telescopes and Student Research into the regular science curriculum is limited by two interdependent factors. Firstly, the majority of curricula introduce astronomy-related concepts through a descriptive lens, with a focus on the “what?”, rather than the “how?” or “why?”. Secondly, astronomy in comparison to other topics gets very little time allocation. Robotic Telescopes provide teachers with enormous potential to teach students not only topics related to science, but also to afford students the opportunity to engage in “authentic science”. Thus, it is vital for the members of the astronomy community to play a greater role in the development of curricula.","[{""country"":[""China"",""South Africa""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study investigated the molecular mechanisms by which BBR suppresses the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. The results show that BBR induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest by interfering with the expression of cyclins D1 and E and that it induces cellular apoptosis through the induction of a mitochondria/caspase pathway. The data also indicate that BBR inhibits cellular growth and promotes apoptosis by down-regulating the HER2/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, it is also shown that a combination of taxol and BBR significantly slows the growth rate of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that BBR could be a useful adjuvant therapeutic agent in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The study presented in this paper uses a novel “Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces” (CCF) model developed in the context of global new product development projects, to examine the way that the interaction of factors relevant to project management contributes to successful ERP implementation processes. Based on regression analysis of responses from 244 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms in Taiwan and China collected in May 2006, we find that the balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces fosters ERP project success, a result which has significant impacts on ERP project management practice. The study also opens up a new direction for future research on ERP implementation processes in that it suggests a novel way to model the interaction of project management factors. In addition, the new measures regarding project success and project management developed and validated in this study should prove to be useful for researchers studying ERP implementation processes.","[{""country"":[""Taiwan, China""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

They are reaching adulthood in an environment where they can, for the most part, get what they want, packaged how they want it, when they want it. This phenomenon is known as the ""Long-Tail Market"", where markets are transitioning primarily to Web-based vendors who do not depend upon fluctuating (or peak) periods of sale, as opposed to brick and mortar stores where physical issues of space and format limit the selection of goods (Anderson, 2008). In other words, Walmart.com can make exponentially more products available than any one physical Walmart store. Camping equipment may always be available through the online marketplace, but you may only find camping equipment within the physical store when it is considered seasonal and cost effective to stock. As librarians, we are seeing that students of the ""Google generation"" are applying the skills they have developed while finding movies in Netflix, and songs in iTunes, and recommendations in Amazon.com, to the finding of information within our proprietary databases and OPACs. This erroneous application creates frustration and disenchantment when resources do not respond accordingly. Information is a commodity, and if we were to think about information literacy in economic terms as well, one could say that instructors of information literacy are connecting the supply of information to the demand, with attention to efficiency and quality. Researchers have applied the Long-Tail phenomenon to the assessment of reference services and the creation of strategic plans for collection development within libraries (Storey, 2005 and Law, 2006).but they have not yet begun to ascertain the effects of this particular economic phenomenon on the student, or establish how it applies to the instruction of information literacy. Using this economic theory introduced by Chris Anderson in his book The Long Tail (2008) and pedagogical theories by Paulo Freire (1970), as well as theories of critical theorists Habermas (1984) and Horkheimer & Adorno (2002), this paper will explore how to include critical thinking in a credit-bearing information literacy course. The theory of Anderson explains the conflict that students of the Google generation face because they are generally unaware of the economic forces which drive the information age, and do not understand how even familiar resources fit into this model. The theories of Friere and Horkheimer & Adorno provide a framework for successful teaching information literacy, which can be defined as ""knowing when and why you need information, where to find it, and how to evaluate, use and communicate it in an ethical manner"" (CILIP, 2009). Traditional critical pedagogical questions of dominance, dialectics, and democracy will be applied to information providers such as Wikipedia, Google, scholarly journal publishing, and federated searching. Ultimately, students who have learned about such resources through critical methods should understand and continue to question the validity and reliability of all information resources. This is the most essential skill in an age of information commodification. The ""Google Generation"" Imagine a typical university student. Chances are, he or she has ""[grown] up with the Internet. He's the single child of affluent parents ... so he's got a Mac in his bedroom, a fully stocked iPod (and a weekly iTunes allowance), and a posse of friends with the same. Like the rest of his teenage friends, he has never known a world without broadband, cell phones, MP3s, TiVo, and online shopping"" (Anderson, 2008). For the purposes of this paper, the ""Google generation"", though defined elsewhere as referring to individuals born after 1993 (Rowlands et al., 2008), will be defined broadly as those younger than 21 years, but also specifically those graduating high school prior to 2012. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We found that providing people with the opportunity to give increases donations, while which people will donate is conditional on the type of request made. Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations.

A questionnaire has been sent to more than 8,000 boat owners in the following countries : Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, UnitedKingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. More than 1650 answers have been received. The questionnaire has been structured in four items : a global statement on fisheries and marine ecosystems, the problems in fisheries and their causes, governance of human to nature relation and governance of human to human relation in fisheries. Fishermen were asked to give their opinion according to a scale system. The opinion expressed are then analysed according to major characteristic of localisation in Europe (country, maritime space), of the type of activity (gear), of the area of activity (coastal/offshore). Finally the results of a multidimensional analysis of the responses are confronted to the main view expressed by the fishermen representative during the interview conducted in the first phase of the programme.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

First, the osteogenic potential of rabbit OMCS was evaluated. Then, the OMCS were transplanted into the interface between the grafted tendon and the bone tunnel created at the tibia. Histological assessments and biomechanical tensile testing were performed after 3 weeks. The rabbit OMCS showed high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, positive staining of ALP, and osteogenic potential when transplanted subcutaneously with beta tricalcium phosphate disks. Newly formed bony walls and positive collagen type I staining were seen around the grafted tendon with OMCS transplantation, whereas such bony walls were thinner or less frequent without OMCS transplantation. Micro-computed tomography images showed significantly higher bone volume in the OMCS transplantation group. The pullout strength was significantly higher with OMCS (0.74 ± 0.23 N/mm(2)) than without OMCS (0.58 ± 0.15 N/mm(2)). These results show that OMCS enhance early tendon to bone tunnel healing.

The Regulation introduced, in addition to the Community registered design right (""CRDR""), a Community unregistered design right (""CUDR"") which is very similar to the CRDR. The CUDR came into force on 6 March 2002. It is in part based on the British invention of the unregistered design right or design right (""UDR""). Before the introduction of the CUDR, this type of right did not exist anywhere else in Europe. While the registered design right (""RDR"") existed in Great Britain since the 18th century, the British legislature only introduced UDR in 1988 while reforming the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (""CDPA""); the UDR entered into force on 1 August 1989. Thus, it is a relatively new right compared to traditional intellectual property rights. Is the British UDR remote from the new CUDR as introduced by the Community lawmaker? The object of this article is to compare the main features of the UDR and the CUDR, in particular focusing on the requirements for protection and infringement, in order to evaluate whether or not the UDR will survive the CUDR, or whether the new CUDR will erase the UDR from the legal landscape, and whether UDR case law will influence future Community design courts case law. Comparisons with copyright will also be made where relevant. Finally, the article raises a further question: how to accommodate the relationships between all coexistent intellectual property rights, national and Community rights on the one hand, and traditional and new rights on the other.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

A Rejoinder to Daudigeos, Boutinot And Jaumier.","The study of institutional change over a period of history involves several theoretical and methodological issues. In proposing a commentary on our article published in Vol. 17 n°3 of M@n@gement (Peton and Peze, 2014), Daudigeos, Boutinot and Jaumier have provided an opportunity to open up the debate, and we thank them for that. Their commentary concerns two major points: a methodological question concerning the choice of data in a historical research context, and a resulting reflection on the consideration given to collective representations in analysis of institutional work. Before replying in concrete terms to the points raised by Daudigeos et al., we wish to return to the objective of our article and clear up one matter they raise. Our study starts with reflection on the different institutional pillars. While Scott (2008) stresses the importance of all three pillars (normative, cognitive and regulative), the regulative pillar is rarely studied in the literature on change. It finds itself relegated to the role of a ratifier of changes driven by the cognitive and normative pillars, and has generally been considered static and treated as the same thing as the rule produced by the State (Scott, 2008; McCann, 1994). The case of Faute Inexcusable, an institutionalized practice introduced in 1898 and still in force today, reveals the complexity of a regulative pillar that has a real, and very specific, institutional dynamic. We can only agree with Daudigeos et al. when they stress the importance of paying attention to interaction between institutional pillars in institutional change. Our article focused mainly on the regulative pillar, such that we do not propose any contribution regarding interactions between pillars and their mutual effects – that was not our research project. However, our contribution to the understanding – and a form of intellectual rehabilitation – of the regulative pillar paves the way for a broader research agenda explicitly aimed at exploring the interaction dynamic between the pillars, without claiming to answer it comprehensively.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

With the potential for commitment of billions of dollars to infrastructure reconstruction in the future, we should apply the lessons of Operation Iraqi Freedom and take a comprehensive, integrated approach to reconstruction operations. After the investment of nearly four years and $24 billion in Iraq, it is clear that the U.S.-led rebuilding effort has fallen short and not contributed enough to accomplishing U.S. strategic objectives. This cannot be attributed to a lack of security alone. Our failure to conduct an initial assessment of Iraqi infrastructure; develop a master plan for rebuilding; and set benchmarks to gauge progress hamstrung the coalition's rebuilding efforts. Although the recently issued NSPD-44 gives the Department of State responsibility to lead and coordinate reconstruction activities, the military will play a critical role. This paper outlines specific reconstruction goals and tasks that the military, along with other USG agencies, must accomplish during the stabilizing, securing, transitioning and reconstructing phases of stability operations. Essential to long term success is the involvement of host nation engineers and officials in the rebuilding of their country, developing a sense of ownership.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This paper argues that the comprehensive reach and foundation of the human development and capability approach has a value independent from and additional to their practical outworkings, and yet also that operational specifications are both possible and vital to the further development of the approach. The paper begins with a thumbnail sketch of the core concepts of the capability approach, and supplements these with additional informational and principle requirements that Sen argues to be necessary for a more complete assessment of a state of affairs. It traces some important avenues along which the Human Development Reports and other empirical studies have operationalized certain aspects of Sen's capability approach. The paper then articulates further developments that might be expected, arguing that such developments must also build upon cutting edge research in other fields. It also identifies certain 'value judgments' that are inherent to the capability approach and should not be permanently dismissed by some methodological innovation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Nonverbal behavior or body language includes facial expression, eye contact, posture and prosody. Prosody conveys semantic or affective information to a listener. Nonetheless, so far in Iran no report on assessment of speech prosody comprehension in patients has ever been published. The aim of this study was to measure the validity and reliability of the prosody comprehension test specifically designed for the Persian language and culture. Methods: This study is a type of test development. 73 sentences were orated by 22 professional vocalists in eight different prosodies. A total of 6582 voices were prepared which were listened by 200, 18-30 year-old students and a voice specialist. Having the content validity calculated for all voices, 1473 voices were found to be unanimously agreed upon by all participants in terms of emotional status which were analyzed by a voice specialist. Eventually, 169 voices were selected for developing the prosody comprehension test including the following four subtests: none motional prosody discrimination, emotional discrimination, naming of prosody and naming conflicts. Reliability of the test was determined by performing the test on 32, 18-60 year-old normal people. Results: The designed test of comprehension prosody had 100% content validity ratio and 94% reliability and the correlation of test of prosody was 89% (p=0.001). Conclusion: This test in Persian language has appropriate validity and reliability and is appropriate for assessment of prosody comprehension.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

All CT scans were interpreted blindly by the emergency medicine (ED) attending physicians and the patients were treated accordingly. Radiologists reported all the CT scans within 12 h. Radiologists' reports were put into the agreement or disagreement group retrospectively. A panel of experts further evaluated the disagreement groups' medical charts and placed them in clinically significant or insignificant group based on the follow-up for 28 days. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this study, 170 CT scans were interpreted. The agreement rate was 68.2%. In the clinically significant disagreement group, eight patients did not receive the required treatment and three patients were over treated. Although the overall mortality rate was 5, none could have been prevented by a prompt radiologist's report. The disagreement group had longer hospital stay (p = 0.006) and transfer to other wards (p = 0.035). The inter-rater reliability between emergency medicine attending physicians and attending radiologists was substantial (kappa = 0.77) and statistically significant (p < 0.0001). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our findings support the cautious use of ED physicians' CT scan interpretations for patients' management. Ideally, the ED physicians should utilize a real-time radiologist interpretation in critical patients. This collaboration will result in better patient management.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Because excellence appears neutral, natural, universal, and a legitimate educational goal, it obfuscates the embedded assumptions that undergird the material practices associated with performances of excellence. These assumptions include the quantification and commensurability of learning, teaching, and scholarship, the necessity of assessment and legitimation of accountability regimes, and the naturalness and universality of competition within postsecondary education. The acceptance of excellence as an organizing frame of the university has enabled much of the neoliberalization of postsecondary education in the United States, and as such, to resist the neoliberalization of postsecondary education, we much challenge its commitment to excellence.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The Boyarins’ diasporic thinking can be applied to diverse contemporary Jewish comedic texts like Roth’s “The Conversion of the Jews,” Englander’s “What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank,” and Auslander’s Hope, A Tragedy. Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, and Larry David also reject traditional forms of Jewish comedy (the need for group identity and solidarity in the face of suffering, persecution, genocide, powerlessness) in favor of an emancipated diaspora that maintains identity while it is outer directed and engages the Other. Although Jewish “diaspora” humor is traditionally associated with disenfranchisement, vulnerability and persecution, Daniel and Jonathan Boyarin view it as an opportunity for an increasingly powerful Jewish identity that benefits from what was once a liability: diaspora or geographical dis persion. By separating communal identity from land acquisition, Jews are able to maintain a sense of group particularity without the domination of the Other, thereby substituting cultural collaboration for confrontation. This version of diasporic thinking complements American egalitarianism at the same time that it expands the scope and affect of traditional Jewish humor. Although, in 1951, Irving Howe could not imagine how the traditional Jewish humor of the embattled European diaspora would translate into an enfranchised, empowered American idiom, I argue that in the hands of Philip Roth, Nathan Englander, and Shalom Auslander as well as popular artists like Jerry Seinfeld, Woody Allen, Larry David, and others, a new form of Jewish diasporic humor is not only thriving in America but","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Monte Carlo tests were used to identify the 31 children whose writing was not based on spellings or sounds of the target words. Two and a half years later, the children took a standardized spelling test. The more closely the digram (two-letter sequence) frequencies in the preschool task correlated with those in children’s books, the better scores the children had in primary school, and the more preschoolers used letters from their own name, the lower their subsequent scores. Thus, preschoolers whose prephonological writing revealed attentiveness to the statistical properties of text subsequently performed better in conventional spelling. These analytic techniques may help in the early identification of children at risk for spelling difficulties.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This paper investigates this for four variables in a standard money demand specification, using Canadian data. Evidence is first presented that the null of unit root with drift (constant, linear, or nonlinear) can be rejected in favor of nonlinear trend stationarity for the variables. Then, Bierens' (2000) nonlinear co-trending test finds two common nonlinear trends among the variables. The trends are consistent with a standard money demand relationship. All unit root and co-trending test conclusions are based on size and power results from Monte Carlo simulations as well as on asymptotic critical values. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the observed nonlinear trending and co-trending might arise in a theoretical model, and with implications for further empirical tests.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

These image acquisition protocols are implemented with the aim of reducing motion artifacts that may be produced by the movement of the neonate's head during the scanning session. Furthermore, axons are not yet fully myelinated in these subjects. As a result, the water molecules' movements are not as constrained as in older brains, making it even harder to define structure using diffusion profiles. Here, we introduce a post-processing method that overcomes the difficulties described above, allowing the determination of reliable tracts in newborns. We tested our method using neonatal data and successfully extracted some of the limbic, association and commissural fibers, all of which are typically difficult to obtain by direct tractography. Geometrical and diffusion based features of the tracts are then utilized to compare premature babies to term babies. Our results quantify the maturation of white matter fiber tracts in neonates.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Thus, resulting in extreme gambling behaviors such as psychological distress, family disintegration, and self-effacement.

The claim is that high hierarchy/low solidarity messages establish an unconscious acceptance of the idea that social inequality and alienation are necessary, that is, the result of human nature. On the other hand, low hierarchy/high solidarity messages establish the foundation for a predisposition to respond to equality and compassion as socially acceptable ways to organize society. Cross-cultural research supports the claim that the signs of interpersonal hierarchy and solidarity in everyday conversation are learned behaviors, that is, the result of nurture.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Society then becomes comprised of what Gergen (1999) describes as isolated souls who are doomed to enter and leave the world as self with everyone else defined as other and therefore different and separate from. It is this deification of the self that has led to what I have come to view as the theology of individualism that dominates Western culture often to the exclusion of community and which has such damaging and isolating effects on individuals, particularly Indigenous students (Kinnane, 2014). Consequently, I argue that the education of psychology students should incorporate critical theory in the analysis of the complex interactions that occur between the person, the relational interactions of family, employment, and neighbourhood as well as the broader socio-political, economic, and cultural milieu.

The most comprehensive framework for the Extended Synthesis is the Major Transitions in Evolution. The Extended Synthesis rests comfortably within a philosophical perspective in which biology does not need to be connected with other areas of science in order to justify itself. I am attracted to an older concept in which biology needs a covering law to connect it with the rest of the natural sciences. Darwin implicated a “higher law,” but did not specify it. If we can elucidate that law, the Extended Synthesis will become the Unified Theory of Biology called for by Brooks and Wiley 25 years ago.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Few studies on the role of OMI/HTRA2 in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are available, but none on its relationship with the cholinergic system and neurotrophic factors as well as other AD-related proteins. In this study, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that AD patients had a higher cytosolic distribution of OMI/HTRA2 protein compared to controls. Quantitative analyses on brain extracts indicated a significant increase in the active form of OMI/HTRA2 in the AD brain. Activated OMI/HTRA2 protein positively correlated with stress-associated read-through acetylcholinesterase activity. In addition, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene expression, a receptor also known to be localized on the outer membrane of mitochondria, showed a strong correlation with OMI/HTRA2 gene expression in three different brain regions. Interestingly, the activated OMI/HTRA2 levels also correlated with the activity of the acetylcholine-biosynthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT); with levels of the neurotrophic factors, NGF and BDNF; with levels of the soluble fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP); and with gene expression of the microtubule-associated protein tau in the examined brain regions. Overall, the results demonstrate increased levels of the mitochondrial serine protease OMI/HTRA2, and a coherent pattern of association between the activated form of OMI/HTRA2 and several key proteins involved in AD pathology. In this paper, we propose a new hypothetical model to highlight the importance and needs of further investigation on the role of OMI/HTRA2 in the mitochondrial function and AD.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Using data for 16 countries from the European Social Survey 2008, we find a sizeable gap between workers' perceptions of the unemployment rate and the actual unemployment rate in the country, which is a meaningful indicator of their misperception of labor market tightness. To handle the interval nature of our outcome of interest, the earnings variable, we estimate interval regressions, as well as ordered probit models. We follow a threefold strategy to tackle potential endogeneity problems, as the model includes: controls for the worker's ability; country-specific fixed effects; the unemployment rate in the region of residence, which might be the benchmark respondents have in mind when reporting their perception of the national unemployment rate and which is known to influence regional wages. Results show that when subjective perceptions overstate the unemployment rate in the country, a one percentage point gap between the perceived and the actual unemployment rate reduces individual wages by 0.4 to 0.7 percent. We discuss a potential mechanism generating this result. A pessimistic view of the labor market leads to concern over own future employment prospects and is thus likely to lower reservation wages; a too optimistic view, in turn, could raise reservation wages, but it would render job finding more difficult.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

After taking the weeklong agent-based lessons, students decreased in their mathematics anxiety (p = .042) and increased in mathematics learning (p = .001), regardless of the presence or absence of the agents’ anxiety messages.

Primary realignment (urethral stenting with a catheter) was undertaken by way of a combined transurethral/percutaneous transvesical approach. Postoperatively, the patient developed a pseudo-transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome, which included dilutional hyponatremia (nadir serum Na 121 meq/L), hypotension (blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg), and heart rate 115 beats/minute although without evidence of cognitive change. The pathophysiology likely involved fluid absorption through open posterior urethral veins.

The seriousness of Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) to combat this issue can be seen when the university has set 2 of its 8 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) targeting graduate employment. The 2 KPIs are; (1) number of graduates who are already employed and (2) being self-employed since leaving the university until their convocation ceremony. At the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, UiTM, the Student Affairs Department has taken several initiatives to overcome the issue. Programmes were introduced to strategically cater the 4 problems. For the English proficiency problem, English entry test was introduced and students who attained below satisfactory level were required to attend a Fundamental English Programme organized by the faculty. At the end of the English programme, the students were required to sit for exit test. The effectiveness of the programme and the improvement of the students were recorded. This paper further discusses the implementation and effectiveness of the Fundamental English Programme introduced by the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering UiTM to fight graduate unemployment.","[{""country"":[""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Several technologies have been mobilised in a large scale that had not been predicted to play any significant role. However, many observers continue to criticize the CDM Executive Board's handling of the project cycle and the lack of development benefits of CDM projects. Therefore, calls for CDM reform have gained strength. An analysis of the CDM project portfolio shows that Least Developed Countries and Africa have so far been sidelined. However, more small-scale projects have been submitted than expected from theoretical analyses of project cycle transaction cost, maybe due to high CER price expectations and a high share of unilateral projects. While developing country companies have been able to capture almost half of the CDM consultancy market, they have not made an inroad into validation and verification. The concentration of host countries has increased. Development benefits of CDM projects are often limited, especially of the large projects destroying industrial gases. The rejection rate of proposed methodologies remains stubbornly high but consolidation of methodologies simplifies document submissions. The time lag from submission of project documentation to registration has recently been falling. Additionality testing is a key element that also supports the development target of the CDM.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Even as it claims a focus on an embodied engagement of Islamic scriptures in West Africa, Ware’s book nonetheless fetishizes the text. It is an apologetic that does not address how, through the mimetic (scripturalizing) practices that are managed by the regime of scripturalization, people in West Africa and peoples throughout the world have manipulated their own and others’ imaginations and have been manipulated in turn.

As part of this community, maintaining a connection with program alumni is vital for assessing the achievement of the program educational objectives. Even with a small engineering program such as our Mechanical Engineering program, establishing an engineering community can be complicated due to factors such as the very diverse student population, and the lack of an alumni association in the school. Many of the students in our program work full time, and most are part time students. The students go through the program as non-cohort groups, making information dissemination more difficult. This paper focuses on the use of social media including Facebook and LinkedIn in creating and growing our engineering community. While Facebook is more popular with the younger population of students, and used mostly for social type of activities and discussions, LinkedIn is the preponderant medium for program alumni, as well as more mature students who are in professional positions and desire to widen their networks. We are also using these media in combination with more traditional activities such as student chapters of professional societies. The paper will discuss features and statistics, and draw initial conclusions on the effectiveness of the above media in growing our engineering community. Future plans and recommendations will also be outlined.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This study analyzes the 2006 Latino National Survey with geographic identifiers to explore how the political context of a county influences Latino partisan self-identification. There are a variety of reasons why the political environment might influence Latinos’ partisan choice. First, a substantial proportion of the adult Latino population in the United States is foreign-born, potentially lessening the influence of parental partisan socialization. Second, increased migration to areas outside the Southwest has exposed Latinos to new and different social, political, and economic environments. Using subgroup analysis, interactive logit models, and regression discontinuity, we find that the local political context influences the party attachment of Latino immigrants in predictable ways. However, for Latinos born in the United States, our analysis does not provide evidence of a causal connection between partisan environment and an individual's partisan identification.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, the IBS subgroup with alternating bowel habits (IBS-A) has been poorly characterized. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVES ::: (i) To determine a set of bowel habit symptom criteria, which most specifically identifies IBS patients with an alternating bowel habit, (ii) to describe IBS-A bowel symptom patterns, and (iii) to compare clinical characteristics among IBS-A, constipation-predominant (IBS-C), and diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: One thousand one hundred and two Rome I positive IBS patients were analyzed. Three sets of potential criteria for IBS-A were developed and compared by multirater Kappa test. Gastrointestinal, psychological, extraintestinal symptoms, and health-related quality of life were compared in IBS-A, IBS-C, and IBS-D using chi(2) test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Stool consistency was determined to be the most specific criteria for alternating bowel habits. IBS-A patients reported rapid fluctuations in bowel habits with short symptom flares and remissions. There was a greater prevalence of psychological and extraintestinal symptoms in the IBS-A subgroup compared to IBS-C and IBS-D. No differences were seen between bowel habit subtypes in health-related quality of life. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: IBS-A patients have rapidly fluctuating symptoms and increased psychological comorbidity, which should be taken into account for clinical practice and clinical trials.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Firstly, music activities delivered by generalists were found to be ‘lost’ attributed to the minimal data kept at the government level about primary music education programs (Parliament of Victoria, 2013). A goal of the study was to document some of those seemingly missing music activities. Secondly, the generalists who delivered music activities in the course of day-to-day teaching, prospective participants in the study, were difficult to find. It appeared that generalists delivering music activities may indeed be ‘lost’ due to a lack of “skills and confidence” (Parliament of Victoria, 2013, p. 19) or submerged in the crowded curriculum (Parliament of Victoria, 2013). Through purposeful sampling, three participants were ‘found’ who demonstrated commitment and enthusiasm for delivering music activities. Thirdly, the findings revealed that the music learning outcomes inherent in the music activities delivered by participants were often de-emphasised or ‘lost’ in the integrated activities favoured by participants. Overall however, the findings indicated a variety of music activities delivered by participants and upon close examination, aspects of best practice pedagogy were ‘found’.","[{""country"":[""South Africa""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The demographic evolution is expected to have considerable impact upon various, major aspects of the economic and social life in all European countries. The healthcare system plays an important role especially in the context of ageing societies, such as Germany. This paper focuses on the evolution of the prevention or rehabilitation service sector during the last years in Germany, analyzes the specific characteristics of the elderly patients being cared for in these facilities and underlines important aspects at the interface between (acute) hospital and geriatric rehabilitative care. Networking, integrated care services and models will be of even greater importance in the future demographic setting generating (most probably) increasing numbers and percentages of elderly, multimorbid hospitalized patients. More than this, the cooperation at regional level between acute geriatric hospital departments and geriatric rehabilitation facilities has become a mandatory quality criterion in the Free State of Bavaria. This paper presents and analyzes issues referring to a precise cooperation model (between acute and rehabilitative care) recommended for implementation even by the Free State of Bavaria while emphasizing several examples of good practice that have guaranteed the success of this cooperation model. The analysis of the main causes leading to longer length of stay (and thus ""delayed discharges"") for the elderly patients transferred to geriatric rehabilitation facilities within the reference model for acute-rehabilitative care provides important information and points at the existing potential for optimization in the acute hospital setting. Vicinity, tight communication and cooperation, early screening, implementation of standard procedures and case management are some of the activities that have contributed considerably to the improvement of the hospital length of stay and transfer management for elderly patients benefiting from (follow-up) inpatient geriatric rehabilitation services. The presented facts are important not only for the German health setting.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Mathematical models, aiming at understanding and optimization of the anaerobic digestion process, describe these reactions in a structured way, the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) being the most well established example. While these models distinguish between different microorganisms involved in different reactions, to our knowledge they all neglect species diversity between organisms with the same function, i.e. performing the same reaction. Nevertheless, available experimental evidence suggests that the structure and properties of a microbial community may be influenced by process operation and on their turn also determine the reactor functioning. In order to adequately describe these phenomena, mathematical models need to consider the underlying microbial diversity. This is demonstrated in this contribution by extending the ADM1 to describe microbial diversity between organisms of the same functional group. The resulting model has been compared with the traditional ADM1 in describing experimental data of a pilot-scale hybrid Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Filter Bed (UASFB) reactor, as well as in a more detailed simulation study. The presented model is further shown useful in assessing the relationship between reactor performance and microbial community structure in mesophilic CSTRs seeded with slaughterhouse wastewater when facing increasing levels of ammonia.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The notion that teachers are true lifelong learners implies that they should hold positive attitudes and values needed to excel in learning. However, information on how teachers value their learning is sparse. This paper examines the dimensions of value placed on learning by teachers who undertook further learning as part of their CPD. As professionals, teachers are workers; therefore, their learning context is inevitably career-oriented. Thus, a Learning Value Scale questionnaire was developed by adapting Super’s Work Values Inventory proposed by Super and Neville (1986). The respondents were 599 teachers categorised into four groups—three groups engaged in different types of learning programmes (Undergraduate (UG), Postgraduate (PG), and Generic), and the control group did not participate in any learning activities. The responses were subjected to Principal Component Analysis. Results show that teachers see learning in four dimensions which are conceptually meaningful for, or associate with, the values of Achievement, Humanitarian Concern, Status, and Career Security. Examination of individual item responses across groups reveals that items for economic and job promotion show a distinct difference between the UG and Generic groups. In light of these findings, the study discusses the systemic cultural factors that conditioned the teachers’ concept of the value of learning. This baseline data can help teacher educators to understand teachers’ identity as learners. The findings also suggest that policy makers should review their learning policy initiative, and teachers as implementers of education should reflect on their own practice of learning.

It supports Settler governance by following dominant political dynamics, and struggles to engage with Indigenous political ordering other than through British-European settler-colonial logics. In response, this article experiments with a dialogical approach to studying political science that is responsive to Indigenous frames of reference and attentive to the colonial political relationship that Indigenous and non-Indigenous people share. We first document and attempt to break with the structural politics of knowledge that conditions Australian political science. We then deploy an idiom for advancing macro-level and informal insights for knowing liberalism on the Australian continent. The final section outlines a selection of key challenging questions that Australian political science needs to address if it is to enter into more appropriate relations with Indigenous political ontology and peoples of the continent.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

A sample of 156 respondents participated in this study. Bias-corrected bootstrap analyses revealed indirect effects of preference discrepancy on psychological and physical violence victimization through conflict resolution. People with high preference discrepancy scores report lower conflict resolution abilities, and in turn, higher victimization rates. There was also a significant total effect of preference discrepancy on physical violence perpetration, suggesting high preference discrepancy increases the chance of using physical violence against one’s partner. Further investigation is thus recommended, to assess if preference discrepancy could function as an additional anchor in the prevention of IPV within couples.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Cloth, $65.00.)Reviewed by Jack LarkinThese three books-two of them emerging from museum exhibitions, the other from a study of private and public image collections-take us into the visual world of the nineteenth century in very different ways. Of the three, Portraits of a People, by Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw, is by far the most useful volume for historians of early America. Based on original research, it engages with the questions that historians care about. Three essays provide contextual, closely argued analyses of the earliest views of African Americans in portraiture, of the creation and significance of the portrait engraving of the poet Phillis Wheatley, and of the career of Philadelphia's African American profile cutter, Moses Williams. Shaw then provides a chronological survey of portraits of free men and women of color, providing generally useful biographical detail and often illuminating short discussions of sitter, artist, and significance.Shaw foregrounds her discussion with a lengthy quotation from Frederick Douglass, who maintained that the real portraiture of black subjects by white artists was virtually impossible, because whites could not see blacks as fully human. Shaw works against the grain to find and interpret images that belie or at least soften Douglass's bitter certainty, and she has found true portraits. Douglass himself, in all his fierce intelligence, leaps out from the page in both a painting and a daguerreotype. Shaw shows us how some American painters, including a few artists of color and antislavery sympathizers like William Matthew Prior, produced fully realized and respectful portraits of striving African American men and women. Yet, as she reminds us, these were rare; they must be seen as a trickle against the flood of hundreds of thousands of comic stereotypes and vicious caricatures that were drawn and published.The Wheatley essay is particularly interesting, providing the poet's frontispiece portrait-as opposed to her poetry-with its first really serious analysis. Shaw makes a good case that it is a revolutionary image, depicting a black female as a genteel woman and a writer. Shaw might at times be guilty of interpretive overreach-it's not clear that this relatively simple, although nicely executed, portrait engraving can hold up the weight of symbolic interpretation she would like to place on it-but is always interesting and provocative. For those of us interested in how portraits represent the self and reveal the social order, this is an important study.Claire Perry's Young America: Childhood in 19th-Century Art and Culture, emerges out of an exhibition that gave this reviewer a good deal to look at and think about. Perry has assembled many interesting images and often provides provocative and useful interpretations of individual works. However, the book breaks no new historical ground.Young America's thematic organization mirrors the class, race, and gender concerns of most social history; it looks sequentially at the country boy, the daughter of liberty, the children of bondage, the African American child, the ragamuffin or urban waif, the papoose, and the child in school. The themes hang together reasonably well, except for the section on the ""Papoose""; the discussion of the images of Native American children seemed tacked on.Young America makes abundant reference to the standard themes of historical transformation-industrialization, urbanization, westward migration and settlement, changes in women's roles, and African American emancipation-but uses them to uneven effect. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP-2 Ab) is a marker of choice for diagnosing early and late RA. Anti-oxidant enzymes activity decreases in RA patients. Till now, the relationship between the rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP-2 Ab, anti-oxidant activity and polymorphism of paraoxenase-1 (PON-1) 192 Q/R in patients with RA has not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to determine the serum level of RF and anti-CCP-2 Ab, PON-1 activity and 192 Q/R polymorphism and arylesterase (ARE) activity in patients with RA. Also, we studied RA markers in different genotypes of PON-1 of RA patients. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: A total of 120 RA patients and 90 healthy persons were subjected to full clinical examinations and routine laboratory tests. PON-1 and ARE activities were determined using an enzymatic spectrophotometric method. PON-1 192 gene polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment analysis. RF was measured by immunoturbidimetry method and anti-CCP-2 Ab was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for windows 20.0. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The sensitivity and specificity of anti-CCP-2 Ab for the diagnosis of RA were 76.2% and 100% respectively. PON-1 and ARE activities were statistically lower (P <0.001) in the RA group compared to the control group. A negative correlation between RF and anti-CCP-2 Ab levels and PON-1 and ARE activities was found. No significant difference in the genotype distribution between RA patients and healthy persons was detected. RF and anti-CCP-2 Ab levels were higher in RA patients carried RR genotype than in those carried QQ genotype. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: High RF and anti-CCP-2 antibody serum levels were found to be associated with decreased PON-1 and ARE activities with no correlation between PON-1 polymorphism and serum levels of RF and anti-CCP-2 Ab in patients with RA. These results may indicate an implication between antioxidant enzymes activity and serum levels of RF and anti-CCP-2 Ab.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Materials and Methods: The current study was designed to evaluate the role of prophylactic antibiotics in the wound infection and outcome of surgery for chronic ear disease. It was the authors' impression that there was no difference between topical and systemic antibiotics in such surgery. Patients who met the inclusion criteria (n=193) were randomly assigned to a topical treatment group or a control group receiving only intravenous antibiotics for 1 dose intra operatively and 3 dose there after. Patients were followed post-operatively and observed for clinical evidence of infection, graft failur and hearing status. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to the incidence of postoperative infection or graft survival.

During the Cold War, U.S. concerns focused on the global contest between democracy and communism. In this competition Pakistan was seen as an important ally. However, Pakistan viewed India as it primary threat and considered global ideological concerns as secondary in importance. At times, each country benefited from the other, but neither ever fully met the other's most important needs. The United States did not support Pakistan in its wars with India and Pakistan did not confront communism except to help oust Afghani governments non-compliant with Pakistan's interests. Pakistan's military held power for more than half of Pakistan's existence and became the U.S. key ally in South Asia. Pakistan's pursuit of nuclear weapons distanced U.S. relations in the post-Cold War environment. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 catapulted Pakistan's importance as an ally but at the cost of supporting a military regime and the erosion of a democratic government in Pakistan. This thesis argues that Pakistan's military now shares a relationship with the United States that builds regional stability but which may also hold political consequences in the United States.","[{""country"":[""Pakistan"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

To create a broader understanding of participation domains, and thereby participation divides, we conduct a systematic literature review. Analyzing 192 journal articles and conference proceedings, we identify central definitions, antecedents, and outcomes of online participation. Most notably, we detect five distinct domains of online participation: political & civic, economic/business, cultural, health-related, and educational participation. Surveying all five domains, we find some noteworthy differences in the respective participation divides.

When harassment and physical abuse impact K-12 students, these situations pose unexpected challenges to novice teachers working to support their students (McKee & Dillenburger, 2009; Vanbergeijk, 2007). In this article, we report on a study of preservice secondary teachers' (PSTs) simulated interactions with a mother who presents evidence of physical and verbal abuse, illuminating how PSTs navigate the uncertainties and challenges of domestic violence. To begin, we describe the concept of a clinical simulation, its origin in medical education, and its influence on teacher education. We outline our design and implementation procedures for the Summers simulation, where each PST interacted with an actor carefully trained to portray a timid Mrs. Summers, who is worried about her son's emerging abusive tendencies. Drawing from the resulting simulation video data, we focus our discussion and implications on the introduction of, and rehearsal within, professional uncertainty and how approximating uncertainty can foster teacher learning. Conceptual Frameworks In 1963, Howard Barrows, a neurologist and medical educator, questioned how future physicians synthesized knowledge and skills into the immediate clinical reasoning they needed in daily practice with patients (Barrows & Abrahamson, 1964). Responding to the challenge of translating knowledge into practice, Barrows crafted the first clinical simulations for future physicians. In a medical simulation, a future physician interacts with a standardized patient defined as a layperson or real patient who is carefully trained to present distinct symptoms and communicate questions/concerns to multiple medical professionals in a standard, consistent manner. In simulation with a standardized patient, a physician practices diagnosing a health concern, constructing a regimen of treatment, and communicating with the patient (Barrows, 1987, 2000). Barrows's design of simulations and the use of standardized patients has become a widespread practice in the preparation of medical professionals. Today, more than 98% of U.S. medical education programs use clinical simulations either as formative learning experiences and/or as summative assessments of clinical practice (Hauer, Hodgson, Kerr, Teherani, & Irby, 2005; Islam & Zyphur, 2007). Barrows's medical simulations rest on four design tenets: prevalence, clinical impact, social impact, and instructional importance. The prevalence tenet supports the design of clinical simulations that approximate situations future professionals will often encounter, whereas the instructional importance tenet supports simulations that require professionals to enact distinct skill sets. The remaining two tenets, clinical and social impact, undergird simulations of distinct situations that will likely be experienced less often in daily practice (i.e., clinical impact) but that are of importance to students, families, or communities (i.e., social impact). It is these two design tenets, clinical and social impact, that directly support our study of how PSTs navigate the complexities of sexual harassment and physical abuse. Sexual harassment--in the form of unwanted sexual advances, gestures, derogatory and/or sexual comments toward another, or other suggestive invitations (California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, 2007)--frequently occurs in middle and high schools (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). All schools should have written public policies against sexual harassment as well as specific reporting procedures set in place that include both male and female personnel trained to investigate claims (Young & Ashbaker, 2008). The presence of such policies and procedures suggests that teachers, administrators, and staff should also receive specific and ongoing training on identifying suspected cases of sexual harassment and responding appropriately. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A Critical Engagement with the Emerging Legal Order of the 1920s","This article concentrates upon Hans Kelsen’s theory of legal monism, as presented in his Lecture delivered at the Academie de droit international, The Hague, in 1926. This Lecture propounds a legal theory which enables a critical engagement with the emerging legal order of the 1920s. The article draws upon recent scholarship regarding the international legal agreements adopted in 1924 (the London Accords) and 1925 (the Locarno Accords) to demonstrate their potential for a new form of European and international stability. This potential, however, remained constrained by the logic and limitations of the primacy of State sovereignty. Within this context, Kelsen’s Lecture sought to set the emerging international order within a unified legal framework of national and international positive law. This framework enabled Kelsen to identify two variants of legal monism, differentiated by the role of State sovereignty in the relationship between national and international law. For Kelsen, it is the choice between the broader ethico-political consequences of these two variants which will shape the further evolution of the global legal order.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This study discusses the male dominance phenomenon through domestic violence in patriarchal society. It positions woman as a secondary level to man. The implications of woman as the “other” and the secondary level are discussed using feminism theory by Simone de Beauvoir and using the Sexual Politics by Kate Millet as the supporting theory. The methodology that is used is qualitative textual analysis in order to analyze the narrative and non-narrative aspects as data of analysis to carry out the ideological meaning within the film. The aim of the analysis is to portray the domestic violence in the forms of physical violence, psychological or emotional abuse, sexual violence, and threat of physical or sexual violence perpetrated by Chuck Traynor that show the male dominance by patriarchal society. It also aims to show the existing portrayal of the sex industry and depict Linda’s struggle in dealing with domestic violence and the enslavement of the sex industry. However, the male dominance can happen because of traditional gender stereotypes and the term second sex victimizes the woman as sexual exploitation of man and tends to make woman struggles. By focusing on male dominance that occurred could highlight the issue of domestic violence experienced by woman in the film with its effects toward woman in order to reduce the number of domestic violence and gender discrimination in every field. The portrayal of the enslavement of the sex industry as a patriarchal product also shows how woman is treated as a sexual objectification which portrays her as a weak and submissive creature.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Despite major advantages, including shorter duration of operation, minimal blood loss and decreased postoperative pain, many surgeons still prefer laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy. It is likely that the unfamiliar anatomical environment, smaller working space and long learning curve impede implementation. The present study assessed the number of procedures required to fulfil the surgical learning curve for posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The first consecutive posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomies performed by four surgical teams from university centres in three different countries were analysed. The primary outcome measure was duration of operation. Secondary outcomes were conversion to an open or laparoscopic transperitoneal approach, complications and recovery time. The learning curve cumulative sum (LC-CUSUM) was used to assess the learning curves for each surgical team. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A total of 181 surgical procedures performed by four surgical teams were analysed. The median age of the patients was 57 (range 15-84) years and 61·3 per cent were female. Median tumour size was 25 (range 4-85) mm. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics and tumour size between the teams. The median duration of operation was 89 (range 29-265) min. There were 35 perioperative and postoperative complications among the 181 patients (18·8 per cent); 17 of 27 postoperative complications were grade 1. A total of nine conversions to open procedures (5·0 per cent) were observed. The LC-CUSUM analysis showed that competency was achieved after a range of 24-42 procedures. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: In specialized endocrine surgical centres between 24 and 42 procedures are required to fulfil the entire surgical learning curve for the posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

After all, a number of Educator Roundtable founders have a long history of strong union activity. We agree with Joel Packer when he argues correctly that NCLB ""is not working,"" that the AYP (adequate yearly progress) policies are ""fundamentally flawed,"" and that the legislation is ""an unfunded, unfair, and unattainable mandate that largely labels and punishes schools and denies all children their basic right to a great public school."" Despite these statements, we fear that the NEA leadership--by insisting that it cannot work to dis-mantle NCLB and replace it with an education policy more suitable to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--teeters close to moral bankruptcy. We call on union leaders, members of Congress, and their Business Roundtable allies to do something radical: we ask them to listen to the highly qualified teachers who work with children every day. People who claim to care about the survival of public education need to know that No Child Left Behind is sucking the very life's blood from our profession, demanding that teachers become readers of scripts rather than professionals engaged in the critical work of educating the children in their care. As long as union leaders refuse to insist that teachers' voices be brought to the forefront in curriculum decisions, teachers remain muzzled and impotent. Make no mistake about it: this silencing of teachers is catastrophic to the health of our nation. What is at stake is not only the status of teaching as a profession but the very future of a generation of children who are being regimented into Stepford automatons. Finding little resistance from educators, corporate reformers have replaced the language of growth, development, creativity, ingenuity, and responsibility with words straight from the factory floor: performance, accountability, standardization. An education system that valued the informed voices of America's teachers would look much different from the system that teachers and students currently suffer under. And it is time to give teachers the respect that most of them deserve, by inviting them to become central figures in shaping classroom practices and local education policy. We make these issues quite clear in our petition (see the sidebar, page 273) and on our website, though Mr. Packer continues to push the NEA lie that our organization does not ""propose any positive changes or alternatives."" The duplicity here is twofold: 1. Mr. Packer was privileged to witness our earliest conversations and knows exactly what our proposed ""positive change"" is: give teachers a genuine voice in policy setting, implementation, and evaluation. 2. The NEA leadership agrees with that position. As Mr. Packer put it: We know that top-down programs and mandates developed by those far removed from the classroom don't work. Programs that actively involve educators and parents in shared decision making with their school leadership and that include support from the federal government--through technical assistance and useful educator-friendly guides to best practice--should be the focus of the next ESEA. Note the use of the phrase ""the next ESEA."" Don't they mean ""the fixed NCLB""? The NEA leadership cannot use the acronym NCLB because they know what we've maintained for the better part of a year: NCLB will never allow the type of shared decision making that the NEA leadership correctly calls for. NCLB is premised on the belief that teachers and administrators are primarily the problem and not worthy of being part of the solution. This is a fundamental tenet of the law. Furthermore, NCLB mandates a predetermined path to educational salvation--regardless of what parents or teachers might desire--as ""failing"" schools must follow NCLB's sanctions, sanctions that ultimately lead to the firing of the very teachers and administrators that the NEA leadership claims to support. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This will result in a new understanding of human biology as well as in the design of new molecular structures as potential novel diagnostic or drug discovery targets. The assessment of gene function may be performed using the tools of the genome program. These tools represent high-throughput methods used to evaluate changes in the expression of many or all genes of an organism at the same time in order to investigate genetic pathways for normal development and disease. This will lead to a shift in the scientific paradigm: In the pre-proteomics era, functional assignments were derived from hypothesis-driven experiments designed to understand specific cellular processes. The new tools describe proteins on a proteome-wide scale, thereby creating a new way of doing cell research which results in the determination of three-dimensional protein structures and the description of protein networks. These descriptions may then be used for the design of new hypotheses and experiments in the traditional physiological, biochemical and pharmacological sense. The evaluation of genetically manipulated animals or newly designed biomolecules will require a thorough understanding of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology and the experimental approaches will involve many new technologies, including in vivo imaging with single-photon emission tomography and positron emission tomography. Nuclear medicine procedures may be applied for the determination of gene function and regulation using established and new tracers or using in vivo reporter genes such as enzymes, receptors, antigens or transporters. Pharmacogenomics will identify new surrogate markers for therapy monitoring which may represent potential new tracers for imaging. Also, drug distribution studies for new therapeutic biomolecules are needed, at least during preclinical stages of drug development. Finally, new biomolecules will be developed by bioengineering methods which may be used for isotope-based diagnosis and treatment of disease.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

An institutional culture that is conducive to teaching and promoting diversity with social justice at its core is critical in this discussion. Central to understanding how social justice and diversity are articulated in institutions of higher education, are the experiences of female faculty and administrators from racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in the U.S. system of higher education. As of 2005, approximately 1% of full professors were Black, 1% Asian, 0.6% Hispanic, and 0.1% American Indian (Turner, Gonzalez, & Wood, 2008). To address the sparsity of underrepresented women faculty, we have assembled a collection of articles that examine a wide range of their experiences while working in higher education. In our opinion these articles can be informative for those scholars aspiring to enter academia or remain (i.e., tenure, promotion, retention), and for those college and university decision-makers in their efforts to sustain them. Given the themes captured by the articles herein, advancement and persistence in academia for underrepresented female scholars continue to be impressive. According to the Urban Dictionary's (1999 - 2011) website, the word ""work"" as in ""you better work"" (1999 - 2011a), or ""workin' it"" (1999 - 2011b), is used to give praise or approval to another person and is analogous to: What you have just said or done is very impressive. The articles reflect various meanings in the title of this themed issue. For instance, one might work in academia while workin' academia (or doing it well), as in demonstrating agency and persistence despite having to negotiate unsupportive academic climates. Other creative uses of language (metaphors, analogies) are present in this issue including academia as extreme sport, women as canaries in a coalmine, and purple and lavender to express theoretical perspectives. The articles in this issue represent multiple genres of research, including narrative approaches, various methods, and theoretical perspectives that reveal overarching themes such as mentorship, collaboration, longevity, resistance, and spirituality. In the article, ""Purple is to Lavender: Womanism, Resistance, and the Politics of Naming,"" Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner describe how the politics of naming, bears down on them and informs their politics of persisting in the academy. They depict how they, as underrepresented or non- White women at two different points along the tenure and promotion continuum, participate in a relationship that challenges the traditional framing of mentor and mentee as giver and receiver. By engaging in the politics of naming they came to identify womanism as a theoretical refuge. Their article leaves us contemplating how womanism, if substituted for feminism, would ""fit in the mouths"" of other underrepresented women scholars and whether a framework of critical race womanism would produce additional challenging issues. The theme of mentoring continues in ""The Spirit Bears Witness: Reflections of Two Black Women's Journey in the Academy."" Authors Gretchen G. Generett and Sheryl Cozart describe the development of a relationship across time as professors similarly positioned along the career track. The development of their relationship occurs through informal interviews that help to bridge their personal, professional, and spiritual lives. Their description of this approach as a healing methodology contributes to understandings of the ways that nonWhite female scholars come to know and grow in the academy. They invite readers to explore whether the avenues for the development of deep and multiple meaningful relationships among these female scholars are constricted. While the informal development of relationships among female scholars in academia is a theme in this issue, more formal opportunities for developing communities and cultures are also presented. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Middle-range theory (MRT) is context-specific conceptualization providing theoretically grounded insights readily applicable to an empirical context. It promotes rigorous and relevant research, bridges practice and theory, and conveys deeper understanding of how and why phenomena occur. The lack of significant MRT is surprising given the considerable efforts supply chain scholars exert to stay grounded in industry practices. As a result, the authors put forth a broad call for more middle-range theorizing and provide guidance on how supply chain scholars may meet this call. Specifically, they describe a MRT lever—theoretical contextualization—that strikes a balance between theory and industry and then present two overarching strategies (bottom-up and top-down) for MRT development. The authors discuss these strategies in the supply chain domain and identify how middle-range theorizing may be undertaken in four emerging, yet important, topics.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The aim of this study was to systematically test if these two aspects interact with each other.

In Study 3, non-student participants reading a charity appeal with both a story about one identified child and statistical information donated less often than participants reading appeals with either only a story about one identified child or only statistical information. We suggest that both emotional arguments (e.g., a story and picture of an identified child in need) and analytical arguments (e.g., detailed statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem) can make us more motivated to help refugees, but that mixing different argument-types can make charity appeals internally inconsistent and decrease donations.","[{""country"":[""Syrian Arab Republic""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This question raises further questions about the nature of autonomy and identity and how these are affected by the various kinds of functional damage caused by dementia. Ronald Dworkin answered this question by arguing that identity is based around what he terms “critical interests” and that these interests are formed prior to the onset of dementia, which means that prior decisions should be applied. Agnieszka Jaworska has criticized this view and argued that people with dementia retain the capacity to form new critical interests because they retain the capacity to value.

Lower production costs decrease the price that profit-maximizing firms will choose to charge customers; as a result, such conduct indirectly benefits customers.1 These buyers are exercising monopsony power over the labor or other input market. Conceptually, monopsony is similar to monopoly; a monopolist is the only seller of goods, while a monoposonist is the only buyer of goods.2 Often, a monopsonist exercises its market power in an input market, where it purchases components that it uses to create products that it sells. Output markets are the markets where those products are sold. Commentators and courts analyze buyer exercises of market power in a variety of circumstances, including labor markets,3 component parts for goods,4 or retailers that are large relative to the firms they purchase from.5 For example, an employer with the power to profitably pay wages that are lower than the competitive level has monopsony power. Recently, in Weyerhauser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., the Supreme Court stated that monopsony is the ""mirror image"" of monopoly and that ""similar legal standards"" should apply to antitrust claims arising out of both buyer conduct and seller conduct.6 However, applying similar legal standards to anticompetitive conduct by buyers and sellers results in underenforcement against anticompetitive buyer conduct.7Antitrust law focuses on the benefit that consumers derive from markets, with consumer generally meaning customer. As such, legal standards have evolved to address sellers' anticompetitive conduct. These standards require courts to measure the procompetitive and anticompetitive effects of firm conduct and balance them against each other.8 Because buyer exercises of market power in intermediate markets tend to increase the welfare of the final customers, courts have been more forgiving to monopsonist conduct;9 they find that monopsonistic conduct reduces final prices and find no liability under antitrust law.10 Currently, courts routinely find anticompetitive conduct by buyers in input markets permissible, whereas parallel conduct by a seller in the output market would be unlawful.11This Note analyzes how courts' leniency affects a particular category of anticompetitive buyer conduct: agreements between employers that restrict competition in labor markets. If, as courts and commentators generally agree, the goal of antitrust law is to promote the welfare of consumers,12 how should courts balance the welfare of workers and customers under antitrust analysis? Arguably, worker welfare should be included in consumer welfare.13 If so, anticompetitive agreements between employers benefit one subset of consumers (customers), while hurting another subset (workers). The persistent procustomer and antiworker effect of such complicates a court's choice to find conduct per se unreasonable or to apply the rule of reason under § 1 of the Sherman Act.14 Further, it calls into question how to balance procompetitive and anticompetitive effects of agreements subject to rule of reason analysis.Because exercises of market power in labor markets tend to cause a result that courts treat as a procompetitive effect of restraints of trade,15 courts must change how they weigh the anticompetitive effects of anticompetitive employer conduct against its procompetitive effects. In output markets (the markets in which goods are sold to the end-use customer),16 courts appropriately focus on the effect of anticompetitive conduct on customers because anticompetitive conduct in output markets extracts welfare directly from customers. Courts should analyze monopsonistic restraints of trade in labor markets with the same primary (and often exclusive) focus on the parties from whom the anticompetitive conduct extracts welfare-the workers.Such a change would force courts to consider the welfare of workers or customers that a restraint immediately affects, determine whether it has a net anticompetitive effect within that specific market, and, if so, find it impermissible. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We use this accounting to problematize the conventional practices of goal-oriented meetings and co-authored papers as forms of academic meaning-making. In finding a meeting point where expertise was disorientated and status undressed, we were able to investigate the idea of co-being between human and nonhuman realities as the step social theory needs to take to become a point of connection with the social world, instead of an escape from it.

A common complication of head trauma is the intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). This study was performed to evaluate the association between early discharge and long-term outcomes of patients with traumatic ICH. Methods: In this prospective cohort, patients with traumatic ICH referring to the emergency departments (EDs) of two teaching hospitals were investigated. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded in the checklists and then a radiologic assessment was done. According to the time of discharge, the patients were divided into two groups: early discharge (≤ 24 hours) and late discharge (> 24 hours). The collected data were analyzed using SPSS-24. Results: A total of 28 patients (84.8%) in the early discharge group and 36 patients (81.8%) in the late discharge group completed the study. The age distribution was similar in the two groups. The most common clinical symptoms after discharge were a headache in the first group and a headache plus vertigo in the second group (n = 7, 25.0% vs. n = 4, 11.1%; P = 0.020). At the end of the follow-up, in the first group, 28 patients (100%) had a GOS of 5 and in the second group, 33 patients (91.7%) had a GOS of 5 and 3 patients (8.3%) had a GOS of 4, showing no statistically significant differences (P = 0.118).

In response, many institutions have turned to corporate principles to run their operation and to recruit their ‘customers’ (that is, the students themselves). This exploratory study serves to ascertain whether using a relationship marketing approach is conducive to the task of identifying, selecting and recruiting highly desirable students. In this respect, particular emphasis is placed on whether these individuals are actually interested in establishing a pre-application relationship with a selected number of institutions, as well as the benefits they hope to accrue from such relationships. A hypothesized framework is thereafter appended as a guide for initiating and developing relationships with prospective students. Key variables influencing the decision process were probed. The reputation of the institution was found to be the most important factor in a scholar’s decision of a place of further study, followed by geographic location and thereafter campus safety. However, these differed between ethnic groups. Scholars’ receptiveness to the prospect of entering into a pre-application relationship with a tertiary education institution was found to be favourable. A mere eight percent of respondents claimed that they didn’t wish to have a relationship with an institution prior to the applications period. The remainder wished to be associated with one or more institutions. It was concluded that on average, the more serious scholar is interested in relationships with two institutions. In this regard, the factors attracting scholars to such relationships were identified. The availability of financial aid was found to be the most prominent factor, followed by curriculum advice and reduced application fees. It was therefore concluded that scholars seek real value and are less concerned with social benefits.","[{""country"":[""South Africa""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Design/Methodology/Approach An action research approach was adopted involving two research initiatives; firstly, a survey to elicit stakeholders’ understanding of sustainable local food, with a view to creating a shared agenda and informing future strategic direction; and secondly a combination of research approaches, including paired discussions, generation of pictorial outputs and a workshop, aimed to inform the future vision and mission of the Partnership. Findings Collaboration with stakeholders through a variety of research initiatives has facilitated the development of a Sustainable Food City Partnership, with the overarching aim of achieving a transition towards a more sustainable food system. Moreover, collaboration has contributed to the transition of the Partnership to ensure sustainability and continuity after the initial funding stage. Research limitations/implications While universities have an important role to play in guiding direction and shaping new community initiatives for sustainability in their regions, the challenges, resources and time involved may be under-estimated; these projects take considerable time to yield fruit. Practical Implications The findings of the study will be of interest to those working in the community to promote education for sustainable development and better food systems. Originality/value This paper addresses a gap in the literature in relation to universities and their collaboration in multi-actor networks, in building capacity and contributing to local sustainability transitions.

Therapeutic strategies, complementary to HAART, aim at a ""functional cure"" i.e. control HIV in such a way that it no longer produces harm to the immune system. Anti-latency drugs, anti-inflammatory agents and/or measures to prevent or eliminate concomitant infections may contribute to a functional cure. Immunotherapy represents another possible strategy, which should reverse deficient T cell generation, aberrant differentiation, exhaustion and ineffective HlV-specific T cell responses. ::: ::: Four major pathways are being attempted: ::: ::: 1. Administration of so called common γ-chain cytokines, including inter-leukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-15 or IL-21, which are crucial in T cell generation, differentiation and function. Only IL-2 has been formally evaluated in a phase 3 trial: although it increased CD4 T counts, it failed to improve clinical outcome. ::: ::: 2. Blockade of negative regulator receptor-ligand interaction, including CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3 has been shown to improve HlV-specific T cell function in vitro, but seemingly discrepant results have been obtained in the SIV macaque model. PD-1 blockade lowered viral load and improved survival, whereas CTLA-4 blockade increased viral load, probably because of immune activation. ::: ::: 3. Therapeutic immunization with HIV antigens. Older trials with de-enveloped HIV particles (Remune®) failed to improve clinical outcome in HIV-infected subjects. More recent trials, using ALVAC®, a canarypox vaccine, containing HIV antigens-encoding genes, mitigated viral load rebound after HAART interruption in several trials, but had no effect or even increased rebound in other trials, the latter result being probably linked to inappropriate immune activation. ::: ::: 4. The most recent tendency is to target dendritic cells with either inactivated autologous virus or virus antigen-encoding RNA. Safety and immunogenicity of this strategy has been well established, but clinical results are equivocal as yet. In any case, this approach is amendable to further refinement, with regard to inclusion of RNA encoded patient-adapted viral sequences and co-stimulatory molecules, as well as improved targeting. ::: ::: In conclusion, several HIV immunotherapy strategies are being attempted, with varying success. The basic challenge remains to find a (combined) strategy, successfully activating effective HlV-specific T cell responses, while reducing inappropriate HIV-promoting immune activation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Methods: Non-equivalent control group pretest and posttest design was used. The participants were men with chronic schizophrenia hospitalized in N mental hospital located in N city (29 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group). The program was provided 3 times a week for 8 weeks, 24 sessions each lasting 45~60 minutes. Effects of this program were evaluated using BMI, K-POMS-B, PANSS. The data were analyzed using percentage, x 2 -test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, paired t-test, t-test, and ANCOVA with SPSS 12.0 version. Results: After the aerobic exercise program, statistically significant decreases in BMI, depression, fatigue score of the K-POMS, and psychiatric symptoms were found for the experimental group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that aerobic exercise programs are an effective psychiatric nursing intervention to decrease BMI, general psychiatric symptoms and fatigue, and also to improve mood states. Therefore aerobic exercise program are suggested as a potential approach for reducing re-hospitalization and facilitating social readjustment for patients with schizophrenia.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

While there are obvious factors like the dot com bust that may explain much of our communal enrollment crash over the last few years, anecdotal reports also suggest that the No Child Left Behind act of 2001 (NCLB), and specifically the fact that computer science is not an area that students are tested on, may be a factor in the decreased presence of computer science at the high school level. But how can we empirically separate the effect of the dot com bust from that of NCLB given the proximity in time of the two events? This paper presents a first attempt to do so: recognizing the fact that private schools are exempt from NCLB, it seems appropriate to compare public school students with their private school counterparts.

Few universities, however, actively develop leadership skills or provide targeted training as a primary objective within course modules. Leadership coaching is a competence that is outside the experience of most engineering academics and providing it offers a new challenge for them. This paper compares two models for teaching 'leadership', offered as options in the final-year of an undergraduate engineering programme. Both use methods far removed from the usual diet of lectures and examinations. One is focused around a semester-long activity where senior students take responsibility for a team of younger students undertaking an industrially-based project. It is supported by a series of activity-based workshops. The second has similar objectives but is very different in style; it encapsulates a three-day intensive outdoor management course that exemplifies team-work and leadership theory through hands-on activities and provides the main focus for precourse learning and post-course assignments. This paper describes the two variants and the philosophy that inspired them. A short survey reveals how a year-group of students responded to the different training methods and provides a comparison of the two educational models.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Although children have been maltreated in the course of our entire history, since they have no knowledge of the wrong and the right, hence ‘interest theory’ of jurisprudence remains true. [1] Child abuse and neglect are serious global issues and can be physical, sexual or psychological. Many research studies have shown that children under the age group of 5-12 are at a higher risk of suffering from child abuse and neglect. The statistical analysis says that 40 million children become victims of child abuse all over the globe and 1,850 die due to extensive abuse and lack of affection and attention. An attempt has been made to differentiate the types of abuses and neglect, the signs and symptoms, the impact of the trauma on the well-being of the child. Drawing inferences from previous research works on the global issues, the paper has been prepared on the national context as the child sexual abuse is an under-reported offence in India. The study conducted by the Government of India in 2015 estimates the burden of sexual abuse which revealed shocking results and showed that every second child in the country was abused; among them, 52.94 per cent were boys and 47.06 per cent were girls. Highest sexual abuse was reported in Assam (52.27%) followed by Delhi (41%), Andhra Pradesh (33.87%) and Bihar (33.27%). [2] There is a causal connection between child abuse and pornography; specifically child pornography depraves and corrupts the young minds which pose more danger to the child abuse. However, arguments frequently presented to defend pornography; such dichotomy stands between law and morality. The research paper tries to review the above issues focusing on recent legislations and views of policy makers in this regard.

A Thai dance master must train close together with his or her students to transfer tacit knowledge. However, there is a lack of teachers and tools for teaching Thai dance. A Thai dance training tool prototype has to be developed to help the dance students practice dance movement outside the class. The tool is developed to give feedback to Thai dance students on basic dancing movements and to get a better performance based on the feedback. The evaluation process for the Thai dance training tool is taken into consideration. The method is to compare the machine feedback points with the Thai dance expert perspective. The comparison method is using the t-test to get a p-value between two groups and the difference within the groups to provide an evidence of significant value. Therefore, this paper is focusing on comparing machine scores with Thai dance expert scores (scores for each body part and an overall score) with 2 groups of Thai dance movement (Group A & B). The result of both groups has shown significant and insignificant values which are irrelevant to the score given by the machine and by the expert. The insignificant result provides the knowledge for improving the evaluation process of the Thai dance training tool.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

For centuries, mankind has used them for agrarian purposes, the military, or recreation. Contrasting literature with behavioral observations, we seek a better behavioral understanding andthus comprehensive solutions for their welfare enhancement. Over the past 6 years, we have assessed physical and behavioral welfare in over 900 mules by surveying owners from Egypt, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and the U.S. These mules participated in shows, brick kiln work, cart-pulling, packing, tourism, and cattle herding. Observations are discussed alongside facts from the literature. Unfortunately, their behavior has been misunderstood by many, and harsh treatment and equipment has been used to control them. Few studies have attempted to define or use learning theory to understand how and why mules and hinnies behave as they do. Hence, understanding their health considerations, natural behavior, and training theory is crucial for those who work with them.Solutions to welfare improvement partially lie in an individual’s ability to handle mules and hinnies from birth, and to proceed slowly through training. Conclusively, this review sets forth a clearer understanding of these hybrids’ behaviors and promotes positive handling, allowing their access to more routine healthcare and ultimately, a higher welfare standard.","[{""country"":[""Egypt, Arab Rep."",""Mexico"",""Peru"",""Portugal"",""Spain"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The purpose of this article is not to dwell on what people perceive adult education to be, but rather to look at the nature and the approaches that are used in the study of comparative education. It is important to explain first the following concepts: Comparative, Adult Education, Comparative Education and Comparative Adult Education. After defining these concepts, the paper proceeds to discuss some of the approaches that are very relevant to the study of comparative education. These approaches are by nature historical, scientific, sociological, philosophical and methodological. The paper then concludes with a discussion on what comparative adult education is, and what it should aim at in the years ahead.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We first develop a life-cycle search and matching model which incorporates random match quality as well as elements capturing important institutional features of the Japanese economy. Our model is consistent with the life-cycle properties of Japan’s labor market, namely that the job separation and unemployment rates are U-shaped, whereas the job finding rate declines with age. We then conduct three experiments that are relevant to Japan: a decline in productivity, a removal of the firing costs, and a decline in the population growth. In the first two experiments, we find substantial changes to these three rates, where young workers tend to be the most affected. We observe, however, a very small labor market impact in the third experiment.","[{""country"":[""Japan""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To determine the effect of this mutation on oxidative stress marker genes, we performed oligonucleotide array analysis (Affymetrix), and compared the results in Atp7b m/m rats with those of a sibling line with the Atp7b w/w genotype. We focused our studies on the expression of the aldo-keto reductase 1 family B7 (AKR1B7)-like protein gene, since this gene codes for reductase enzymes involved in the detoxification of oxidizing compounds (e.g., aldehydes) and was differentially expressed in Atp7b m/m and Atp7b w/w rat liver. Akr1B7 mRNA expression was significantly increased in comparison with the expression of 4 other known oxidative stress responsive genes, haem-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), thioredoxin (Trx), aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). By searching binding motifs, five nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) binding sites were located in the 5'-upstream region of the akr1b7 gene. Transient co-transfection with both I-kappaBalpha and the Akr1b7 6 kb promoter (p6.0-AKR-Luc) inhibited luciferase activity of p6.0-AKR-Luc in HepG2 cells. Cuprous ion however did not affect the transcription activity induced by p6.0-AKR-luc. Gel-shift assay showed that the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB increased in the livers of LEC rats, suggesting that the oxidative stress is mediated through NF-kappaB. The results indicate conclusively that in LEC rat liver, akr1b7 might be up-regulated by oxidative stress mediated through NF-kappaB, but not that mediated directly by copper.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This paper presents a framework for crisis management that incorporates insights from research on social media users' behaviour. It looks beyond specific platforms and tools, to develop general principles for communicating with social media users. The framework's relevance is illustrated via a widely publicised case of detrimental UGC. The paper proposes that, today, businesses need to identify relevant social media platforms, to monitor sentiment variances, and to go beyond simplistic metrics with content analysis. They also need to engage with online communities and the new influencers, and to respond quickly in a manner that is congruent with said social media platforms and their users' expectations. The paper extends the theoretical understanding of crisis management to consider the role of social media as both a cause and a solution to those crises.

The data available on their spontaneous signing is summarized here and possible reasons for the spontaneity discussed. Instructional techniques for promoting spontaneity are outlined, and implications of sign spontaneity for research are considered. Nonverbal children can learn to sign spontaneously to express their desires, to initiate social interaction, and to describe aspects of their world; they also sign egocentrically to guide their own behavior. This spontaneous signing, it is argued here, develops as an adaptation and extension of the behavior of goal-directed grasping to the tasks of social communication. To promote this spontaneity it is important to begin sign language instruction with the expression of desires, to de-emphasize imitation, and to use structured waiting. The developmental aspects of nonverbal children’s acquired spontaneity in signing suggest intriguing research possibilities.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The language of brave space conveys a tone for engagement while also proposing a manner of engagement (Cook-Sather, 2016). The transformative experience of engaging in student-faculty partnership in and of itself constitutes a brave space where learners transition from dependence on authority to self-authorship (Baxter-Magolda, 2009, 2014). Within this paper we share Nicole’s lived experience engaging in authentic learning within the brave space created through pedagogical partnership. Nicole’s expression of her teaching philosophy privileges the importance of the shared accountability that students and educators have for teaching and learning and represents how she embraced the notion of self-authorship to create an understanding of how her teaching philosophy informs her growing practice as a registered nurse.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Australian governments want courts, constituted overwhelmingly by non-indigenous lawyers, to decide land disputes as for feudal socage. Therefore, this article suggests a need to understand this attempted radical reframing of Australian Indigenous titles to land, through the convenient lens of Goffman's frame analysis. The research question is whether Anglo-Australian frame transformation of the Indigenous land titles into mere religion, song and art, extinguishes land title. The article tries to show that Australian indigenous land title is communal allodial title, as a bundle of subsisting rights by operation of Australian Continental Common Law, which therefore cannot be extinguished by the fraud inherent in frame transformation. Indigenous land title is true communal allodial title, beset by a fraudulent colonial occupation, suggesting a lack of internal reason in colonial policy and administration. Successive governments have tried to frame transform the highly sophisticated and ancient indigenous legal and social system, including sophisticated celestial mapping and navigation systems, into mere religious art. This frame transformation is reversible by epideictic rhetoric. The Indigenous system is transmitted phylogenetically, in which governance government officials can have no participation. Indigenous land title cannot be extinguished.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In particular, the core factor (CF) and the upstream activation factor (UAF) have been shown in vitro to bind the core element and the upstream promoter element, respectively. We have analyzed in vivo the DNAse I footprinting of the 35S promoter in wild-type and mutant strains lacking one specific transcription factor at the time. In this way we were able to unambiguously attribute the protections by the CF and the UAF to their respective putative binding sites. In addition, we have found that in vivo a binding hierarchy exists, the UAF being necessary for CF binding. Because the CF footprinting is lost in mutants lacking a functional RNA polymerase I, we also conclude that the final step of preinitiation-complex assembly affects binding of the CF, stabilizing its contact with DNA. Thus, in vivo, the CF is recruited to the core element by the UAF and stabilized on DNA by the presence of a functional RNA polymerase I.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The SDPDM results show that the direct drag effect of land and energy is, respectively, 0.75 and 2.38%, indicating that the constraints of land and energy will reduce the economic growth rate by 0.75 and 2.38%. Besides, the indirect drag effect is 0.40 and 4.86%, suggesting that the focal unit’s economic growth would also be influenced by the behavior of its neighbors.

Design: The paper has the character of a cross-sectional validation study. Methods: The study was conducted between November 2015 and January 2016. The convenience sample consisted of 207 registered nurses working in internal care units at a specific faculty hospital in the Czech Republic. Analysis of the psychometric properties of the HSOPS was conducted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reliability testing. Results: Acceptable psychometric properties of the HSOPS were verified in our study. We confirmed 12 components of the HSOPS, the same number stated in the original version from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The reliability of the instrument was evaluated using the Cronbach alpha coefficient, and is considered acceptable. Conclusion: These findings can help healthcare institutions to raise awareness of patient safety culture and to gain a comprehensive overview of the individual dimensions of patient safety culture. In the future, the instrument could help to compare the components of patient safety culture, not only at a national but also at an international level. ::: Keywords: factor analysis, Hospital survey on patient safety culture, internal care units, instrument, nurse, patient safety culture, reliability","[{""country"":[""Czech Republic""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

While some medical school curricula include budgeting and student loan education, content on managing finances as a resident is usually lacking. We sought to quantitatively assess residents' financial circumstances, needs, and interests to inform the design of a resident personal finance curriculum. Methods Surveys were sent to residents in eight specialties at an academic medical center. Likert-type responses allowed respondents to rate their level of comfort (1 = Very Uncomfortable, 7 = Very Comfortable) and interest (1 = Very Uninterested, 7 = Very Interested) in various personal finance topics including budgeting, loan repayment, disability insurance, life insurance, home buying, and retirement planning. Details regarding financial circumstances, including assets, liabilities, and insurance, were also collected. Results of questions that utilized a Likert-type scale are reported as median (interquartile range). Results Of 346 residents surveyed, 144 (41.6%) responded. Residents were from Internal Medicine (56, 38.9%), Pediatrics (34, 23.6%), Emergency Medicine (18, 12.5%), and other specialties (36, 25.0%). Ninety-one (63.2%) reported educational loans, with an average balance of $191,730. Credit card balances exceeding $3,000 were reported by 11 (7.6%) respondents. One-hundred-two (70.1%) reported emergency savings, but only 65 (45.1%) reported having a retirement account (average balance $27,608). Respondents rated highest comfort levels with budgeting (5[4-6]), and lowest level of comfort with disability insurance (2[2-4]) and home buying (2[2-5]). Interest in learning each topic was high (6[5-7]), with retirement planning (6[5-7]), investing (6[5-7]), and home buying (6[5-7]) the topics of highest interest. Conclusion These results highlight the deficits in personal finance literacy among residents. Future work should focus on development of a nationally scalable personal finance curriculum for residents.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This note clarifies this challenge and possible contributions by considering: (1) what estimated relations would be informative for improving understanding within an intergenerational life-cycle behavioural framework with important unobserved variables (e.g. genetics); (2) possible resolutions to estimation problems; and (3) different types of data. The greatest progress can be made by focusing on: Links between parental background and adult child resource access for which effects are thought to be particularly large and relatively uncertain. High quality data regarding (a) representativeness, (b) power, (c) coverage of important concepts for such studies and (d) limited measurement error. Data that permit better estimates, including their robustness to different assumptions - e.g. with complete information on key variables for two or three generations, on intergenerational transfers, linked to time series records on contextual changes, sibling information, experiments, and/or longitudinal data. Through careful examination of existing data, keeping in mind considerations in this note, much can be learned about the IGT of poverty.

However, a research data management (RDM) service does not exist in Japan. Therefore, at the National Institute of Informatics (NII), we developed the next-generation RDM on a national scale by using the open science framework (OSF). We combined the RDM with the existing NII worldwide cyberinfrastructure services (SINET and GakuNin) and OSF add-ons for external Cloud services and institutional repositories. Finally, we displayed the first closed trial for nationwide RDM services in seven universities and a national research institute for research integrity; this helped promote open science in Japan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. NII and participant organizations obtained some RDM operating know-how and discovered new issues by follow-up meetings.

Finally, Brazilian and American racial attitudes differ considerably in explaining black disadvantage. These findings question perceptions of Brazilian racial attitudes and the efficacy of dominant theories for their analysis, suggesting a context‐driven approach to theorizing and for antidiscrimination strategizing.","[{""country"":[""American Samoa"",""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program hubs are uniquely suited to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations across universities and academic medical centers. This paper describes the activities at the Columbia University CTSA Program hub to address a current public health crisis, the opioid epidemic. Columbia's CTSA Program hub led a three-phase approach, based on the Conceptual Model of Transdisciplinary Scientific Collaboration as described by Stokols et al.: (1) a university-wide planning and brainstorming phase to identify key leaders across many domains who are influential in addressing the opioid epidemic, (2) a campus-wide and community outreach to identify all interested parties, and (3) ongoing targeted support for collaboration development. Preliminary metrics of success are interdisciplinary collaborations and grant funding. We describe recent examples of how interdisciplinary collaboration, academic-community partnership, and pilot funding contributed to the development and funding of innovative interdisciplinary research, including the New York site of the HEALing Communities initiative. The processes are now being used to support interdisciplinary approaches for other translational public health issues.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Along with European novel, the Historic Albanian novel is written on novel awereness, but the later, due to political causes, conserved this romantic spirit longer. Therefore it’s present nowadays not just for political issues, but because of existential ones. Besides other characteristics this type of novel reveals, it’s on our interest to bring to evidence the features it gained by some writers of the second half of the 20th century like: SabriGodo, Jusuf Buxhovi, Bilal Xhaferri, Ismail Kadare, Dhimiter Shuteriqi, Skender Drini, Mira Meksi, Ben Blushi etc. It’s obvious that in the modern hist.novel of the second half of the 20th century, critical awereness towards history is seen as realistic one. In the Balkans today’s novel represents the strengthening of the national conscience , whilst the European one represents the national crisis, the resistance to cosmopolitan issues as well as the concern on various types of ideology. The hist. Alb. novel of the beginning of the 21st century changes from being narrative to authentic fiction; therefore it enriches the Albanian novel through direct reference on historic truth. Kadare’s novel, which develops a new attitude towards history ; its parody on historical function as an opposition to censorship, makes out the most innovative example in this context. The typological mixture is a presentation of the inner development of our literature indicating structural changes due to actual social and cultural Albanian structure after the 90’s. V.Shkollovski states that novels can be best modified compared to other janres.

Wound healing can be particularly challenging following high-energy trauma where wound necrosis and infection rates are high. Surgical incision for joint arthrodesis can also be considered high-risk as it requires extensive and invasive surgery and postoperative distal limb swelling and wound dehiscence are common. Recent human literature has investigated the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) over high-risk closed surgical incisions and beneficial effects have been noted including decreased drainage, decreased dehiscence and decreased infection rates. In a randomised, controlled study twenty cases undergoing distal limb high-energy fracture stabilisation or arthrodesis were randomised to NPWT or control groups. All cases had a modified Robert-Jones dressing applied for 72 h postoperatively and NPWT was applied for 24 h in the NPWT group. Morphometric assessment of limb circumference was performed at six sites preoperatively, 24 and 72 h postoperatively. Wound discharge was assessed at 24 and 72 h. Postoperative analgesia protocol was standardised and a Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Score (GCPS) carried out at 24, 48 and 72 h. Complications were noted and differences between groups were assessed. Percentage change in limb circumference between preoperative and 24 and 72 h postoperative measurements was significantly less at all sites for the NPWT group with exception of the joint proximal to the surgical site and the centre of the operated bone at 72 h. Median discharge score was lower in the NPWT group than the control group at 24 h. No significant differences in GCPS or complication rates were noted. Digital swelling and wound discharge were reduced when NPWT was employed for closed incision management. Larger studies are required to evaluate whether this will result in reduced discomfort and complication rates postoperatively.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Adhesins must be released by cleavage before the parasite can enter the cell, but the processing enzymes have remained elusive. Recent work indicates that the Toxoplasma rhomboid intramembrane protease TgROM5 catalyzes this essential cleavage. However, Plasmodium does not encode a direct TgROM5 homolog. We examined processing of the 14 Plasmodium falciparum adhesins currently thought to be involved in invasion by both model and Plasmodium rhomboid proteases in a heterologous assay. While most adhesins contain aromatic transmembrane residues and could not be cleaved by nonparasite rhomboid proteins, including Drosophila Rhomboid-1, Plasmodium falciparum rhomboid protein (PfROM)4 (PFE0340c) was able to process these adhesins efficiently and displayed novel substrate specificity. Conversely, PfROM1 (PF11_0150) shared specificity with rhomboid proteases from other organisms and was the only PfROM able to cleave apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). PfROM 1 and/or 4 was thus able to cleave diverse adhesins including TRAP, CTRP, MTRAP, PFF0800c, EBA-175, BAEBL, JESEBL, MAEBL, AMA1, Rh1, Rh2a, Rh2b, and Rh4, but not PTRAMP, and cleavage relied on the adhesin transmembrane domains. Swapping transmembrane regions between BAEBL and AMA1 switched the relative preferences of PfROMs 1 and 4 for these two substrates. Our analysis indicates that PfROMs 1 and 4 function with different substrate specificities that together constitute the specificity of TgROM5 to cleave diverse adhesins. This is the first enzymatic analysis of Plasmodium rhomboid proteases and suggests an involvement of PfROMs in all invasive stages of the malaria lifecycle, in both the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This mind-map is an essential working tool that uses indexing features—such as author names—as reference points. The Harvard style (HS), in which citations in the text are made of names and years of publication and the references are listed in alphabetical order, actively helps to establish this mind-map. In our view, the Vancouver style (VS), in which citations in the text are numbers and the references are listed in order of appearance within the text, does not enhance the formation of a mind-map in a similar way and makes detections of incongruity between the reader’s mind-map and the text more difficult. In an ideal academic world, HS would be used because of these two effects: constant education of and easy quality control by the scientific reader. Although VS reduces printing space and allows easier reading for less academically trained readers, scientific readers may find this style difficult when trying to check and verify sources. For reviewers, who cannot opt not to make such checks, VS is even more tedious. We advocate that journals using VS in print should use HS for the reviewing process; further, in the final printed version, the references should be numbered and listed alphabetically rather than according to the order in which they are cited. Especially for maturing scientists, reading texts with HS referencing is essential.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Selected self- reported HBCs in the past 12 months by BMI category were examined in this secondary analysis of the Canadian Community Health Survey 4.1. These HBCs included increased sports/exercise, weight loss and improved eating habits. Barriers to HBC were also examined. Results: Our final sample was n = 111 449. Overall, 58% of respondents had made an HBC, with increased sports/exercise as the most important HBC in 29% of the sample, followed by improved eating habits (10%) and weight loss (7%). Half (51%) experienced barriers to HBC; lack of will power was most commonly cited, followed by work and family responsibilities. Obese respondents reported HBC more frequently than normal-weight respondents (60% vs. 55%), but the prevalence of increased sports/ exercise and improved eating habits was similar across BMI categories. Regression models accounted for only 6%-10% of the total variance. Conclusion: That a majority of respondents had made at least one HBC bodes well for positively shifting population health. Additional work to further characterize the population, and to improve on population indicators, is needed to assess the impact of health promotion/disease prevention efforts.

Recent studies have used long light exposure to produce photic phase shifts or to enhance non-photic phase shifts. The presence or absence of light can also influence the expression of locomotor rhythms through masking; light during the night attenuates locomotor activity, while darkness during the day induces locomotor activity in nocturnal animals. Given this dual role of light, the current study was designed to examine the relative contributions of photic and non-photic components present in a long light pulse paradigm. Mice entrained to a light/dark cycle were exposed to light pulses of various durations (0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 h) starting at the time of lights-off. After the light exposure, animals were placed in DD and were either left undisturbed in their home cages or had their wheels locked for the remainder of the subjective night and subsequent subjective day.

It is emphasized that liability has an advantage over taxation: inefficiency of incentives arises under taxation when, as would be typical, it would be impractical for a tax to reflect all variables that significantly affect expected harm, whereas efficiency of incentives under liability does not require the state to determine expected harm - it requires only that injurers pay for harm that occurs. However, taxation enjoys an advantage over liability: incentives under liability are diluted to the degree that injurers might escape suit. The optimal joint use of taxation and liability is also examined, and it is shown in the model that is analyzed that liability should be employed fully because liability creates more efficient incentives than taxation; a tax should be used only to take up the slack due to the possibility that suit for harm would not be brought.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Planning for sustainable development requires integrating conflicting criteria on economy, energy, environment and social aspects. In this paper, we introduce a Weighted Goal Programming model involving criteria on the economic development (GDP), the electricity consumption, the greenhouse gas emissions, and the total number of employees to determine optimal labor allocation across various economic sectors. The proposed model is validated with data from the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates). The results of the model aim to provide empirical evidence and insights to decision makers and policy analysts in developing optimal strategies able to simultaneously satisfy energy demand, economic growth, labor development and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to achieve sustainability targets by the year 2030.","[{""country"":[""Bahrain"",""Kuwait"",""Oman"",""Other small states"",""Qatar"",""Saudi Arabia"",""United Arab Emirates""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Taking as the dependent variables stylistic features identified in machine learning research and popularized in a Web interface called the Gender Genie, a multivariate analysis was conducted of entries from random weblogs in a sample balanced for author gender and weblog sub-genre (diary or filter). The results show that the diary entries contained more 'female' stylistic features, and the filter entries more 'male' stylistic features, independent of author gender. These findings problematize the characterization of the stylistic features as gendered, and suggest a need for more fine-grained genre analysis in CMC research. At the same time, it is observed that conventional associations of gender with certain spoken and written genres are reproduced in weblogs, along with their societal valuations.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The pre-migration experiences of Croats over the past century, spanning imperial and fascist periods, socialism, the Yugoslav Wars of Succession, and independence, combined with the struggles and challenges of life in Canada, have all but defined the lives of diaspora Croats for generations. This is reflected not only in the particularities of different migration waves, opportunity structures, and other barometers of diaspora adaptation but in the effects of major upheavals and transformations in the “place of origin,” variously defined as empire, nation, republic, region, or domovina (homeland). Disparities among and between different generations of Croats are typically conceived of as political/ideological. This tendency, though driven largely by the tumultuous history of the former Yugoslavia, overlooks the complex dynamics underlying significant social, cultural, and other conflicts and contestations within diaspora Croat communities, many of which were on full display during the Homeland War, a time when the “thousand-year-old dream” of Croatian independence was to unite all Croats globally. The implications of the Croatian case for thinking about generation are found in the constant and, at times, fraught engagements of diaspora Croats with their homeland.","[{""country"":[""Canada"",""Croatia"",""Slovak Republic""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The reason for this theme being highlighted is the excellent exchange of knowledge between EU policy makers and the relevant patient communities. The former negligence has been caused by the apparent low patient numbers. The definition of a rare disease in Europe contains, that there are less than five patients out of a total population of 10000 persons suffering from this disease. Taking the total of all patients, suffering from rare diseases, it becomes a different number. An estimated 30 million EU citizens are suffering from a rare disease. This tells us that rare diseases are actually not exactly rare. Due to the great part of the population,which is affected, we have a social obligation to prioritise on this matter. Furthermore, the type of health conditions deserves a strong focus. The European Union, and notably the European Parliament, has made significant progress towards the provision of a political framework, which would define rare diseases and provide incentives for the research and development of medicines. The EU Orphan Medicines Regulation, adopted in 1999, was a political milestone in the prioritisation of rare diseases. It has provided the European Union with a clear competence in refining this topic. It was this legislation, which created incentives for medical manufacturers to develop products, furthermore, they generated a market exclusivity going beyond patent protection and a fee waiver for the evaluation and registration process of specialized products. The establishment of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) in 1995, meant the foundation of a centralised body, which can appropriately deal with the necessary central registration of available and registered medicines. This has been a great success story. Since then, 639 products have been registered with the European Medicines Agency. More importantly, the Agency transformed Europe to a leading region for research and development in this field.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

These factors determine the activity and attitudes of an elderly subject and preserves his control and self­-determination.Most psychologists currently consider human aging to be the continued development of an active subject who interacts with society, during which involu­tion symptoms are persedinterspersed with progressive changes that help to sur­mount the destructive phenomena of gerontogenesis and help to achieve a new level of self-realization of the an individual's personality (Korsakova, Balashova, 1995; Antsypherova, 2001; Ryff et al., 2004). With this the aspect of personality realization in the elderly own need in using personal experience of relations with environment, of self-understanding and self-regulation, this experience appropriated at the previous stages of personality development -- in childhood, adoles­cence and adult age, is underestimated by psychologists. Some authors consider this experience to be a personal resource (Antsypherova, 1996, 2001; Ermolayeva, 2007; Erikson, 1982). No individual uses all of their potential personal resources over the course of one's their life because some resources were not needed or available (Hekhauzen, 2003; Druzhinin, 2005). All of the possible resources combined form ""the space of potentials"" (Leontiev, 2011). These as yet unused personal resources can be considered to be a latent resource of personality, which is possible to achieve only through a self-determined choice made on one's own (Leontiev, 2011). During aging, use of the appropriate personal experience is com­plicated by increased feelings of inability and incertitude and decreased levels of self-regulation.Based on these issues experienced by the elderly, we the aim of this study is to search for possibilities and special conditions for mobilizing personal resources in the elderly.The task of this study is to use a specially organized art environment as an ex­ternal factor for mobilizing personal developmental resources in the elderly.The following theoretical foundations form the basis of this study:* Previous stages in personality development and previous forms of its exis­tence gradually provide a hierarchic structure in which the new psycholog­ical formations, strategies and tactics are not eliminated, but instead, they are qualitatively changed. The previous formations are enriched, limited, or become more dominant due to their inclusion into new systems of perso­nality that are linked with the environment and into new life attitudes. This personal potential permits an elderly person to realize productive changes in their own life and to perform new meaningful activities (Antsypherova, 1996).* Subjectivity in the elderly involves a process of self-determination through an actualization of the purpose of life, preserved control functions, a stable and flexible self-image, self-acceptance and the possible search for a new identity (Alexandrova, 2000).* Each ""generating activity"" (Antsypherova, 2001, p. 95) in the elderly favors an actualization of new meanings in the social world of objects surmounted by the state of incertitude at this stage of ontogenetic development. It re­quires the stimulation of mental potentials to force the personality to use both actual and potential life experience, which forms the ""zone of proxi­mal development in the elderly"" (Ibid).* The participation of an elderly individual in an integrated mental activity (Tatenko, 1995, p. 33) transforms some structural functional units. Among them, the unit of motivation for development and purpose-making abilities are first decreased as well as their motivation and useful abilities ""the re­sults and meanings of one's own mental activity in own experience"" (Ibid). …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This collision among contexts makes for a turbulent transition and has profound implications for identity formation, friendship patterns, aspirations and expectations, and social and economic mobility. Undocumented children move from protected to unprotected, from inclusion to exclusion, from de facto legal to illegal. In the process, they must learn to be illegal, a transformation that involves the almost complete retooling of daily routines, survival skills, aspirations, and social patterns. These findings have important implications for studies of the 1.5- and second-generations and the specific and complex ways in which legal status intervenes in their coming of age.

The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the fisheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the flow of benefits from the fisheries. In reality, different interest groups often push for several, often conflicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage fisheries is referred to as the fisheries management regime. The fisheries management regime consists of a (i) fisheries management system, (ii) fisheries enforcement system and (iii) fisheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appropriately designed and implemented. The efficacy of the overall fisheries management regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of fisheries management. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multidisciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques. In many respects this is the kind of problem operations research techniques are designed to deal with.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A search was made for equal assumption of responsibilities and, specifically, for joint leadership, i.e. a formal mandate for decision-making affecting the full range of responsibilities attaching to the managerial post. The results show that shared leadership is tracked on a work-life level, and that the most far-reaching form joint leadership was found among 5 % of the managers. Thus, the phenomenon cannot be ignored as anecdotal. This adds relevance to influencing perceptions of leadership towards more pluralism, in which questions of leadership naturally incorporate more interactive variations than does the hitherto accepted theory of singular leadership.","[{""country"":[""Sweden""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This ambiguity has often been the focus of research designed to investigate the processes by which syntactic structures are built during sentence comprehension. Reading time differences between more difficult and less difficult reduced relative sentences (e.g., The hangman executed by the government was convicted of treason vs. The martyr executed by the government was convicted of treason ) have been interpreted as reflecting syntactic disambiguation processes. In this article, we point out that there exists a possible alternative interpretation of the differences, namely, that reading times are longer for the more difficult sentences because the information in their relative clauses mismatches a reader’s general knowledge of how events typically occur in the world or how they are typically referenced in discourse. Under this interpretation, the differences in reading times do not have their bases in disambiguation processing.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

She traces the evolution of gay life, gay organizations and gay identity in San Francisco from the 1950s to the mid-1990s, identifying two events as pivotal in their evolution. First, in 1969 the encounter between early homophile organizing and the New Left produced gay liberation and its signature contribution - coming out. Second, the sudden decline of the New Left in the early 1970s reduced the viability of the radical gay-liberation goal of societal transformation and prompted gay activists to redirect their movement to the affirmation of gay identity and the pursuit of gay rights. ""Forging Gay Identities"" should be valuable for anyone studying social movements, culture, identity politics or ogranizational theory.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The plasma concentration of verapamil was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and general peripheral vascular resistance (GPVR) were measured using integral rheography according to Tishchenko (Mingograf-410, Russia); blood pressure (BP) was measured by Korotkoff sounds. Analysis of verapamil pharmacokinetics in both experiments showed identity of the averaged curve profiles that did not differ significantly. The pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable. Based on hemodynamics analysis, HR elevation 1 h after verapamil administration was the most common reaction in both experiments; a short CO rise and GPVR decrease were observed in experiment 2 1 h after administration. These hemodynamic shifts were not pathologic and did not deviate from the physiological range in healthy people; changes in verapamil pharmacokinetics were also not detected.

In this study, a novel systematic methodology is proposed for the energy management of the ship propulsion engine, which is the largest ship energy producer. The methodology employs a combination of tools including statistical analysis, predicting the engine air flow via compressor modelling and energy and exergy analyses, whereas its output includes the engine operating profile, the most frequently occurring propeller curves and the engine most frequent operating points, the key performance indicators for quantitatively assessing the recorded parameters quality as well as the energy and exergy flows and exergy destruction of the engine components. The methodology is implemented for three case studies for a very large crude carrier, a container ship and a bulk carrier, for which recorded data were available by using different monitoring techniques from either noon reports of automatic data acquisition systems. The derived results provide the engine operating profile demonstrating that the investigated vessels were operating in slow steaming conditions with a lower engine efficiency associated with a greater exhaust gas wasted energy. The measured data analysis demonstrates the better quality of the data recorded by automated monitoring systems and pinpoint maintenance issues of the engine components. Lastly, the exergy analysis results demonstrate that the exhaust gas and jacket cooling water provide the greater exergy flows rendering them attractive for energy saving initiatives, whereas the engine block, compressor and turbine are the engine components with the greater exergy destruction, thus requiring closing monitoring for timely identifying mitigating measures.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Findings indicated that while the vast majority of the sample had experienced sibling violence, they utilized terminology in a manner that failed to recognize their experiences as a form of violence. When the data were classified according to gender and level of violence within the sibling relationship, quantitative analysis indicated a difference in terminology. In an attempt to interpret these results from the theoretical perspective of discourse as an aspect of social constructivism it was postulated that the study identified both a dominant discourse that renders physical violence among siblings invisible and several subordinate discourses by which individuals reflect their varying characteristics. It was suggested that future research utilize qualitative analysis to clarify and expand upon this interpretation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It considers Australia’s history of failing to protect Indigenous peoples from racially discriminatory legislation, and the problem of cultural racism which remains in contemporary law and policy. The article evaluates recommendations of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples which refer to the notion of ‘advancement’ and prohibition of racial discrimination unless it is for the purpose of ‘overcoming disadvantage’. These issues are critically analysed in light of current law and policy intended to be beneficial for Australia’s First Peoples: the new Indigenous Advancement Strategy announced in the 2014-15 Federal Budget; and the Improving School Enrollment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure (‘SEAM’). These matters suggest that more robust constitutional protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples is necessary to guard against racial discrimination that can be entrenched in purportedly benevolent law and policy.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The study contributes to the literature on persistence in productivity along four main lines. First, it develops a conceptual framework that links the persistence in productivity performance to persistence at the firm level in innovative activities, which include the adoption and imitation of innovations introduced by third parties. Second, it shows how the internal characteristics of companies, including the propensity of managers to leverage dynamic capabilities, can shape the dynamics of the process. Third, it confirms that external factors, such as the access to local pools of knowledge and the dynamics of economic activity, have relevant effects on persistence and shape its evolution along its path. Fourth, the use of Multiple Transition Probability Matrices (MTPMs) and the subsequent econometric analysis provides substantial evidence on the relevance of the crucial distinction, within non-ergodic dynamics, between past dependent processes, characterized by full hysteretic irrever sibility, and path dependent processes in which events that take place along the process may affect its direction and pace.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Since the data set was collected over a longer time period (10 years), we also added each individual’s exposure to risk. To estimate the parameters of the three Sarmanov distributions, we analyze a pseudo-maximumlikelihood method.

It focuses on creativity and innovativeness towards the production of high quality artefacts to fulfill societal needs. It is line with this mandate that the Visual Art curriculum has been crafted to refine and train students in the various art disciplines such as Textiles, Sculpture, Ceramics, Leather Work, Jewellery, Basketry and Graphic Design, just to mention a few. However, certain developments in recent times militate against the realization of this mandate. The craze for Graphic Design at the expense of other art subjects has almost reached its peak. 8 out of every 10 Visual Art students in the Tertiary and Senior High Schools prefer to offer Graphic Design. This unfortunate development has left most of the other art related subjects with few students. In most of the Senior High Schools in Ghana, the other art subjects have been scrapped leaving Graphic Design, General Knowledge in Art and a 3 dimensional art subject as the (subject combination). As a result, most of the teachers who teach the other art related subjects have become redundant except a few who teach General Knowledge in Art. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the cause of the problem and to proffer solutions. The study adopted the Purposive Sampling Technique. The sample population was made up of two-hundred and ten (210) respondents. The main research tools employed to collect data for the study were questionnaire and interview. A major finding of the study is that most respondents prefer Graphic Design because of its computer relatedness, general appeal and employment prospects. The study recommends that ICT should be incorporated into the curriculum of all art related subjects as well as rebranding of the other art subjects such as Sculpture, Leather Work and Basketry to be more attractive and appealing.","[{""country"":[""Ghana""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, when he is confronted with the skepticism of one of the officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport investigating the ship’s sinking, Pi provides an alternative version of his tale of survival, a version that replaces animals with people. Pi then puts a question to the investigators: “So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can’t prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?” When both officials choose the story with animals, Pi replies, “Thank you. And so it goes with God” (352). 3 Although reviewers of Life of Pi are, without exception, warm in their praise of Martel’s storytelling abilities, they have found his treatment of religion unpersuasive. As Peter Whittaker succinctly puts it: “This wonderful book did not make me believe in God but it did reinforce my faith in the considerable redemptive powers of fiction” (33).2 But this is precisely Martel’s point. He is not out to prove the existence of God, but rather to justify a belief in God’s existence. Martel’s position is a post-modernist one, from the perspective of which God’s existence has the same status in relation to truth and reality as Pi’s experience of shipwreck. Agnostics, Pi tells us, “lack imagination and miss the better story” (70). God’s existence, in other words, is a matter neither of fact nor of faith, but rather is a better story than the one told by those who doubt or deny God’s existence.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The current paper is a corpus-based research to explore the word frequency and text coverage of Coxhead's AWL in research articles of education. To this end, 1.7 million-word corpus was compiled consisting of 239 research articles published by Educational Research Review, International Journal of Educational Development, International Journal of Educational Research, Linguistics and Education, Teaching and Teacher Education during the period of 2002 to 2010.Using WordSmith program, computer analysis showed that the AWL words accounted for 4.94% (84115 of the running words). The qualitative analysis also indicated huge differences in frequency of first two subsets in comparison to the rest (accounting for almost 50% of the whole occurrences). An attempt was also made to identify the most frequent word families of AWL in the Education Research Articles Corpus as well as to obtain a list of non-AWL words (not included in Coxhead's list nor West's General Service List) but still have the criteria to be included in the general academic vocabulary of education. A word to be included in the list must occur at least 50 times in the corpus and appear over 5 times in all journals. This study concluded that attempts must be made to create discipline-specific word lists. Further pedagogical implications are discussed in detail.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In Zambia, the historic arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard is predominant in most health professions’ training programmes. Scientific validation of this practice, however, remains scarce. The aim of this study was to compare the academic performance on the historic arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard to the Grade Point Average (GPA) score attainment for pharmacy students examined between 2013 and 2017 at the University of Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 445 randomly selected final examination results for undergraduate pharmacy students examined between 2013 and 2017 at the University of Zambia. The data was analysed using Stata 13 and GraphPad Prism 5. For all the statistical tests conducted, normality of the data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. There was statistically significant difference between the historic arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard and the course-specific examination composite score attainment in all the courses (P<0.0001). ::: Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference between the examinees’ GPA score attained and the acceptable GPA score of 3.0 (Median GPA 1.75; IQR: 0.75-2.25 and 1.67; IQR: 1.0-2.0) for the fourth and fifth-year examinees respectively). The comparison of the academic performance on the arbitrary 50% pass-fail standard and GPA score attainment for pharmacy students revealed that despite students demonstrating ability to attain high course-specific composite scores using the arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard, the attained median GPA score was statistically significantly less than the minimum acceptable GPA score of 3.0. While the 50% pass-fail standards’ precision to detect academic performance maybe questioned, the findings suggests that the incorporation of a credit point and GPA system for making assessment decisions to rate students, certification and graduation requirements in Health Professions Education may offer better precision and prediction to detect academic performance and competency attainment.","[{""country"":[""Zambia""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Academics perceive a decrease in the control over their own work due to the increasing presence of non-academic managers. The presence of new public management and managerialism has also been apparent in Portugal since the end of the 90’s. Several studies have been developed to understand the impact of these changes, but few of them concentrate on the administrative side. The aim of this paper is to examine the changing landscape of professional boundaries in higher education institutions in a binary system like the Portuguese one. Our main finding is that even though non-teaching staff are nowadays recognised as more qualified and more relevant even in terms of the visibility of their work, the traditional roles assigned to both the teaching and non-teaching staff are still pre-dominant, especially in terms of the clearly asymmetrical power relations between these two groups.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The NT region is mired in a variety of economic, social and political challenges that have contributed to mass migration north to Mexico and the United States. We contend that higher education can contribute to the future development of the region. One approach to explore the potentional of higher education engagement is to examine the level of collaboration between institutions within the region, between the NT and the greater Central America region and with external partners such as the United States and the European Union. While we argue that regional partnerships rely heavily on North-South collaborations, we also contend that the conditions exist in Central America for further development of a more integrated higher education community.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

A systematic review was conducted to determine the effectiveness of health promotion interventions that target social isolation and loneliness among older people. Quantitative outcome studies between 1970 and 2002 in any language were included. Articles were identified by searching electronic databases, journals and abstracts, and contacting key informants. Information was extracted and synthesised using a standard form. Thirty studies were identified and categorised as ‘group ’ (n=17) ; ‘ one-toone ’ (n=10) ; ‘service provision’ (n=3) ; and ‘ community development ’ (n=1). Most were conducted in the USA and Canada, and their design, methods, quality and transferability varied considerably. Nine of the 10 effective interventions were group activities with an educational or support input. Six of the eight ineffective interventions provided one-to-one social support, advice and information, or health-needs assessment. The review suggests that educational and social activity group interventions that target specific groups can alleviate social isolation and loneliness among older people. The effectiveness of home visiting and befriending schemes remains unclear.","[{""country"":[""Canada"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

He came to China more than ten times to investigate Chinese education, deliver academic lectures, and conduct cultural exchanges from the 1920s to the 1940s. He made a great contribution to Sino-American cultural and educational exchanges in Modern China. However, for quite a long time, academic circles at home and abroad have paid little attention to this because of Dewey’s dazzling work in the field of education. Based on a systematical investigation of all Monroe’s previous visits to China, from the perspective of educational exchange between China and other countries, this article gives a relatively deep exploration into Monroe’s work to expose the subtleness and depth of its historical truth. It examines the relationship between Monroe and overseas Chinese students, Monroe and Educational System in 1922, Monroe and the reform in Chinese primary and middle schools during the 1920s to the 1940s, Monroe and the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture as well as the China Institute in America. It draws the conclusion that Monroe has exerted a profound influence on the educational development of China in modern times, and made a unique contribution to talent cultivation, educational reform, social transformation, and cultural and educational exchange.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this paper I argue that politicization provides a useful springboard for remedying democratic deficits at the EU and global level. Despite this promise, there are a range of concerns that inhibit a direct relationship between politicization and increased democratic legitimacy. The paper unpacks what politicization is and how it might relate to democratic legitimacy. It then argues that problems surrounding representation – in particular the constructivist view of representation – complicates this relationship. Significantly the notion of mobilization generates suspicions of democratic representational legitimacy. In response, the paper details a framework for assessing the democratic legitimacy of representative claims under conditions of politicization that responds to the aforementioned concerns. This framework is briefly applied to the cases of TTIP and TPP to show its merits.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Training the next generation of environmental health scientists has been an important part of the SRP since its inception. In addition to basic research, the SRP has grown to include support of broader training experiences such as those in research translation and community engagement activities that provide opportunities to give new scientists many of the skills they will need to be successful in their field of research. Looking to the future, the SRP will continue to evolve its training component by tracking and analyzing outcomes from its trainees by using tools such as the NIEHS CareerTrac database system, by increasing opportunities for trainees interested in research that goes beyond US boundaries, and in the areas of bioinformatics and data integration.

According to the empirical data obtained, after a twelve-year period (1995-2006) of inactivity in this area, the SCJN recently (2007-11) has begun to gradually take action. The change is evident in three aspects: a) the increased use and reinterpretation of its powers in Amparo proceedings; b) the increased use, interpretation and regulation of Powers of Investigation for serious violations of individual guarantees (abrogated in 2011), and; c) the inclusion of deliberative elements in preparing proceedings on grounds of unconstitutionality (Accion de Inconstitucionalidad). The change in the SCJN’s behavior towards human rights since 2007 is explained by the institutional independence it has gained in the fragmented political system in assuming the role of arbitrator in important conflicts between political actors. The SCJN has also developed strategies that legitimate its greater involvement in protecting human rights before the political system and society. In general, the political system under which the Court acts has not reacted to provoke a reversal of this tendency in favor of human rights. In the 16-year period studied here, the incremental change in the SCJN’s behavior is observed along with its evolution from a weak court with marginal participation into a court that has won its independence before political power and is currently looking for greater participation in protecting human rights.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This process wish to test a model that was constructed based on a variety of models as reviewed from various scientific journals and the results of the research that has been done before. Finally, it was found that there are seven independent variables were able to significantly improve people's satisfaction in public service held by government. In other words, this research found that hypothetical model has been tested on a limited basis in the city government. All variables constructed in the model can be used to form the model, but this model still requires testing the validity of the spectrum of types of services are varied and diverse characteristics of the area, in hopes of finding a stable model structure and universally valued.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As such, this strategy is deceptively threatening to the territorial integrity and political independence of the target States of groups such as Hezbollah, Mahdi's Army, and Hamas. Under traditional interpretations of the jus ad bellum, indirect aggression can be attributed to sponsor States if it is comparable to the direct use of force by a State, or if the State is substantially involved in the armed group's attack. That Iranian support is veiled, and rarely meets the control requirement necessary over its armed groups, leaves a significant gap in efforts to deter this unlawful behavior. This article examines the nature of Iran's support to select armed groups, whether it constitutes unlawful aggression, and provides a comprehensive legal framework for deterring this aspect of the Islamic Republic's foreign policy.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Under which rules office-holders on these positions or in units operate varies between countries. Apparently, the countries that initially relied on informal rules and pragmatic bargains such as the UK and Denmark struggle with increasingly developing formal rules to govern Special advisers (SpAds) whereas in ‘usual formalization-suspect’ such as Germany and Sweden the role of functionally equivalent staff units rather changed without any change in the formal regulation, but in an informal process hardly noticed outside federal government. Based upon a Public Service Bargain perspective, the paper aims to explain this ‘formalization paradox’ reflected in differences in the degree of formalization of the PSB of such SpAds and ‘political’ staff units in Denmark, UK, Sweden and Germany.","[{""country"":[""Denmark"",""Germany"",""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The two-dimensional landscape famously described in Justice Robert H. Jackson’s concurring opinion in Youngstown has dominated discourse about the interaction of the three federal branches. Charting presidential conduct on the vertical axis of a map whose horizontal axis measures Congress’s position ranging from approval to disapproval gave Justice Jackson an elegantly simple and memorable way to classify presidential actions from the most strongly defensible to the most constitutionally vulnerable.The resulting classification scheme became a convenient triptych describing the geography of a “flatland” constitutional universe — one constructed in a two-dimensional space, carved into three simple zones. Missing from that triptych has been an analytical guide for navigating a multidimensional universe of relevant constitutional values and relationships. This Essay proposes an approach to developing such a guide: by considering two additional dimensions relevant to the separation of powers — respect for federalism and concern for individual rights — courts can better discern the lawful shape of presidential power.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In broad terms, we can distinguish at least two major traditions which have developed more or less in parallel directions and in increasing interaction with one another. There is the older American tradition of “borderlands studies” that has gained new ground and forms today an established academic institution around the scholarly organization Association of Borderlands Studies (ABS) with its regular conferences and publications, most notably the Journal of Borderlands Studies (JBS). In this review I will concentrate on the more novel European based research tradition which has partly gained inspiration from the American scholarly discussion and partly opened new research directions, with certain influence on the broader international research community. This tradition is perhaps best known through the series of Border Regions in Transition (BRIT) conferences and the publications linked to them. Since the first gathering in Berlin in 1994, there have been ten BRIT conferences organized in Finland, the U.S., India, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Poland, Canada and Chile. Its activities have gathered together scholars from around the world, from Europe and the Americas as well as from Asian countries. In my analysis on the recent trends in border studies I will concentrate mainly in reflecting on the publications of BRIT conferences. As in the U.S., also the European conference and publication activities have led to more challenging institutional forms. Members of the BRIT network have carried out several national and international research projects including large-scale projects of the European Union Framework program for research such as Lines of Exclusion as Arenas of Co-operation (EXLINEA) and Local Dimensions of a Wider European Neighbourhood (EUDIMENSIONS). In addition, new research units and Centres have been established both in the European Union and outside, e.g. Finland, the Netherlands, the UK, Canada, India, Israel and recently even Japan.
