Stakeholder risk perceptions are a key factor in adaptation to climate change because they fundamentally drive or constrain stakeholder action. This paper examines climate change perceptions of winter tourism stakeholders in Tyrol (Austria). Using a qualitative approach, expert interviews were conducted. Four opinion categories reflecting different attitudes toward climate change issues were identified: convinced planners, annoyed deniers, ambivalent optimists, convinced wait-and-seers. Although the findings generally indicate a growing awareness of climate change, this awareness is mainly limited to perceiving the issue as a global phenomenon. Awareness of regional and branch-specific consequences of climate change that lead to a demand for action could not be identified. Current technical strategies, like snowmaking, are not primarily climate-induced. At present, coping with climate change is not a priority for risk management. The findings point out the importance of gaining and transferring knowledge of regional and branch-specific consequences of climate change in order to induce action at the destination level.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

While the survey highlighted that funding is predominantly from government sources, there is growing interest in the diversification of funding sources to meet service demand, enable service innovation and attain agency sustainability. Flexibility and discretion of funding utilisation is favoured by agencies to meet service objectives. Summary of key findings: Of the 398 Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) (response rate 35.5%) that completed the survey – 298 of these provided organisational funding information (298 SHS represent approximately 20% of the services in the AIHW data collection) – while 216 provided funding dollar amounts. Also a small sample of 21 non-SHS provided funding information (with 17 providing funding dollar amounts). As this sample is likely to be unrepresentative, any findings in relation to these providers should be treated with caution and not directly compared to the SHS findings. Services profile – of the SHS and non-SHS respondent services (n=319) 17.7% of respondent services were homelessness specific agencies with 70.7% providing a mix of homelessness and non-homelessness services. Annual revenue of these services comprised: 21.9% less than $1m, 30.2% $1m–$5m and 47.9% greater than $5m. Funding profile (n=216 SHS that provided funding dollar amounts) – not surprisingly, 84.6% of funding received by SHS comes from government (49.5% via NAHA or NPAH). A further 5.2% government and 2.7% non-government funding is allocated by the parent agency. Only 3.6% of funding came from donations, philanthropy and sponsorships. Rent contributed to 92% of internally generated revenue. However this makes up only 2.4% of the total (internal plus external) funding source. For non-SHS (n=17) 60.6% of total funding came from government and 21.3% from donations/sponsorship/philanthropy. 75.6% of internally generated revenue came from social enterprise however this was only 0.7% of total funding. No SHS or non-SHS reported funding via social impact investors or social impact bonds. The level of unmet demand in the SHS sector suggests that resources are not adequate to meet demand. In 2013–14 for every 100 clients there were 60 unassisted requests and in 2014–15 there were 47 unassisted requests.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The use of alternative construction techniques to build the walls of UK housing has the potential to reduce their environmental impact in a range of ways. This includes the reduction of embodied energy as well as operational energy use, the latter through improved thermal performance. A major challenge to be overcome if alternative techniques are to be used is the acceptability to purchasers. The current acceptability of a range of construction techniques and issues that are important to purchasers were examined using a questionnaire. Although the acceptability of lower carbon alternatives is less than that of the conventional technique, findings in this research suggest that there is potential for their use in UK housing. The acceptability of alternative construction techniques varies greatly with type. Concerns expressed about the construction techniques could often be dispelled by existing research, indicating that education is key to improving acceptability of alternative construction techniques and hence opening the way to accessing their environmental benefits. The respondents identified environmental issues, finance, operating costs and risk as key areas of concern, which need to be considered during decision-making.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

By using a sample of 99 strategic alliances in high-tech industry, we empirically examine the theoretical hypotheses proposed in this paper, and find some evidence supporting these hypotheses. Consistent with transaction cost economics (TCE), empirical results suggest that alliances are more likely to be organized by equity joint venture (EJV) when more uncertainties or complexities are involved. However, the existence of alliance experience can also significantly affect the alliance governance, and we find out that alliance experience may substitute for contractual-based governance to some extent, for both prior ties and reputation negatively correlate to the choice of equity alliance.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The SLA is an agreement signed between the service provider and the service consumer for accessing the service provided by the service provider over the internet. We can investigate the negotiation strategy between the service provider and the service consumer through the third party called a Broker. In many approaches SLA is designed and trusted through the measurement of various non-functional requirements such as response time of job, CPU usage, memory usage and the storage used by the consumer. Main focus of the business process is satisfying the customer need by quick response. In our proposed approach for satisfying the service consumer (customer), parameter such as response time of deadline based job is considered. The response time of the job is affected due to improper scheduling of the job. Therefore a novel hierarchical scheduling with job prioritization is used to give more priority for deadline based jobs. This approach will satisfy the service consumer and meet the SLA by increasing the performance of the scheduling algorithm.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Our findings are consistent with Hong and Stein’s (1999) “underreaction hypothesis.” Unlike prior literature, we pinpoint the length of underreaction by employing daily data. We provide a comprehensive examination of the return linkages among 25 commodities and 49 industries. This provides a more detailed investigation of underreaction and investor inattention hypotheses than most related literature. Finally, we implement data-mining robust methods to assess the statistical significance of industry returns reactions to commodity log price changes, with precious metals (such as gold) featuring most prominently. While our results indicate modest out-of-sample forecast ability, they confirm evidence that commodity data can predict equity returns more than four trading weeks ahead.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The developing countries are becoming more open to adapting and accepting Western business practices. One of the important issues in this context is the use of the standard performance measurement systems. In the current literature, the capability to measure the performance of manufacturing industry operations can be seen as an important prerequisite for improvement. Companies have increased the capabilities of their performance measurement systems. The manufacturing industries in developed countries have been developed and implemented successfully multi-dimensional performance measures, and measurement systems for their business success. Whereas research results and data related to developing country's state of performance measures are very minimal. With the recent global integration and economic relevance of developing countries, we investigated the level of performance measurement systems in Ethiopian. The paper presents the existing practices in performance measures, and measurement systems based on case studies on twelve companies and questionnaire survey on thirty two companies’. A survey and case study results show that manufacturing industries still largely use financial and productivity performance measures. Despite the powerful advantages of performance measurement, it has not been widely implemented in the manufacturing industry in developing countries. The current performance measurement systems have faced different challenges what they did not encounter in developed nations companies.","[{""country"":[""Ethiopia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The EU has been losing market share in almost every commodity, and this trend is expected to accelerate in the future. The US continues to have significant presence in bulk commodities, but has lost share in most crops, expect corn and cotton, while its meat export growth faces competition. In the rest of the developed world, Australia has been increasing its exports in most commodities, whether crops or livestock. New Zealand has been growing faster, but in a more limited range of products (essentially dairy and sheep meat). Finally, Canada has remained rather stable or has slightly increased its export share. The biggest changes are occurring in the developing world. While Argentina has shown significant gains, it is especially the three agricultural giants of the developing world that would impact most world markets. Brazil is the clearest winner in agricultural market developments, with a pace of growth in its soybeans, sugar, and meat sector that raises questions about how far can it go and at which cost for world market prices. China is the other side of the developing world equation with significant increases in its imports in almost every single commodity where Brazil increases its exports, raising questions about the extent of its import growth and its potential impact on world prices. Finally, India continues to be the big unknown, with huge production of many crops and of milk, yet almost absent from world agricultural markets because of its present tariff structure, adding an additional level of uncertainty for world agricultural markets, because of its mere size.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The industry is seeing an increased emphasis on collaborative working, encouraged by the increased use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and the government’s drive towards the widespread adoption of BIM by 2016. However, the rail industry is also in a state of flux. Network Rail has recently undergone reclassification as a central government body, bringing significant debt to the national balance sheet and the potential for changes to the management of the industry. In addition, the emergence of new technologies may bring significant advances but also additional challenges and competition for the industry.

Typically, its quantification requires data that is not easily available in different geographies. This paper makes use of a methodology based on monetary input–output tables and international trade statistics that might be easily replicable to many metropolitan areas in the world, and which is intended to provide a first rough estimation of urban material flows. The paper discusses the results obtained for four metropolitan areas (Lisbon, Paris, Seoul–Incheon and Shanghai), assessing the material requirements of these economies. The urban areas are compared in terms of the quantity and the type of material input, destination of materials within the economy and their distribution among economic activities. The results showed that while Lisbon is the most diverse urban area in terms of the consumption of material types, it is also the urban area with the least diversified manufacturing sector. The application of this methodology to several urban areas and across multiple years enables the assessment of the technological and economic evolution of those regions.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In a setting with unemployment, this could be the case if the employee's performance signals that his productivity exceeds the average productivity of unemployed workers by a sucient amount. Thus, bonus payments can be used to motivate a worker to perform dicult tasks, while termination con- tract motivates them performing easy ones.

Many researchers believe protest participation is crucial for democracy to be consolidated and effective, and previous studies have shown that protest participation is one of the main characteristics of a democratic public. Though protest is on the increase in western democracies, it declined in postcommunist democracies from 1990 to 2000. The bulk of participation research still comes from western countries and less is known about participation patterns of postcommunist and especially post-Yugoslav citizens. More importantly, previous cross-national studies have mostly not dealt with the motivations behind protest participation in post-Yugoslav countries. The aim of our research was twofold: firstly, we compared levels of protest participation (signing petitions, joining in boycotts, and attending lawful/peaceful demonstrations) in three regions: seven post-Yugoslav countries (BiH, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia), seventeen established EU democracies, and nine East-Central European EU member states. Secondly, we analyzed the relationship between protest participation and prodemocratic political culture (i. e. democracy index consisting of items indicating acceptance of democracy and rejecting authoritarian rule) in all three regions. We employed the newest (2008) wave of European Values Study, which consists of representative national surveys. The results indicated that post-Yugoslav population is almost as protest oriented (Mprotest = 1.89) as citizens in western countries (M = 1.93), and significantly more than ECE EU member states (M = 1.55). Interestingly, within post-Yugoslav countries, citizens of Kosovo and Macedonia report the highest levels of protest potential. The results also showed that protest participation is positively and statistically significantly associated with prodemocratic orientations in all three regions, as well as within all seven post-Yugoslav national samples. If Europeanization of West Balkan countries is understood in terms of their populations taking part in elite-challenging behaviour (e. g. protest participation) motivated by pro-democratic orientations, then all non-EU post-Yugoslav countries are well on their path to Europe.

If this mechanism is strong then lower exposure or a commitment not to bailout banks, two policy prescriptions that have emerged in this literature, can backfire. We present a simple 3-period model with strategic sovereign default where debt is held by local banks or foreign investors and show that: i) Reducing exposure reduces commitment and hence increases the probability of default, without avoiding the “doom loop”. Furthermore, that allowing banks to buy additional sovereign debt in times of sovereign distress can rule out the doom loop. ii) A no bailout commitment is not sufficient to rule out self-fulfilling expectations.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this study, experimental and numerical studies were performed to determine the effect of using a flow barrier wall, a recharge well and a combination of these, to control SWI in unconfined coastal aquifer systems. The SEAWAT model was used to predict the SWI wedge and the behaviour of the retreating residual saltwater after installing the remediation measures. The results show that increasing the barrier wall embedment ratio (db/d) from 0.44 to 0.67 led to an increase in the repulsion ratio (R) from 20.8 to 46.87%. Moreover, increasing the freshwater injection rate ratio (Qi/Q) from 0.22 to 0.56 increased the repulsion ratio (R) from 10.93 to 22.39%. Barrier wall embedment with ratios (db/d) of 0.44, 0.51 and 0.57, combined with a freshwater injection ratio (Qi/Q) with a value of 0.56, achieved (R) of 41.14, 45.41 and 50.0%, compared with 20.8, 27.1 and 34.40% for the barrier wall only and 22.39% for freshwater injection only. Freshwater injection ratios (Qi/Q) of 0.22, 0.33, 0.44 and 0.56 combined with a barrier wall embedment ratio (db/d) of 0.508 achieved repulsion ratios (R) of 33.9, 36.5, 39.0 and 45.42%, compared with 10.9, 15.6, 18.8 and 22.4% respectively for freshwater injection only and 27.1% for the barrier wall only. A combination of flow barrier and freshwater injection forced the saltwater to retreat and achieved values of R greater than either the barrier wall or freshwater injection separately.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Competences lead to flawless and accurate execution of tasks, quality awareness, analytical abilities and openness to change. Competences help employees act in an organized, objective, purposeful and responsible way and enhance creativity, sensitivity and good interpersonal qualities in the work context. The purpose of this study was to establish the moderating effect of employee competence on the relationship between employee reward and nurse job performance in Kenyan National Referral Hospitals. The study employed cross sectional survey research design. Descriptive statistics, correlation and regression techniques were used to analyze the data. The study found out that the relationship between employee reward and job performance is moderated by employee competencies. The results provided sufficient statistically significant evidence to signify a moderating effect of job competence on the relationship between employee reward and employee job performance of nurses in Kenyan national referral hospitals. Employee competence, significantly improves the influence of employee reward on job performance from 74.2 percent to 82.0 percent. Employee reward and employee competence together explain 82.0 percent of the variance in job performance.The moderating effect of employee competence, significantly improves the influence of employee reward on job performance. It can be concluded that firms attach much value to employee competencies since these contribute directly to how well a firm will perform. The government through the Ministry of Health, high education and other non-governmental partners should initiate training programs for employees to sharpen their skills. ::: Key Words: Employee Competence, Employee Reward, Job Performance, Kenyan National Referral Hospitals.","[{""country"":[""Kenya""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Probability of detecting a fraud is lower than finding errors, since fraudulent activities are deliberately hidden: they are usually pursued using complex and carefully planned schemes. The results of the empirical research have revealed that utmost importance in encouraging frauds can be attributed to the conditions where various individuals can commit frauds. Thorough analysis of scientific literature, accounting and audit regulations had allowed the authors to prepare the classification of principle conditions increasing fraud risk. This classification will aid public sector executives, accountants and auditors in detecting fraudulent activities, identifying their causes and location, objectively evaluating their effect on performance of the enterprise and foreseeing specific measures of prevention.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

There colleges got accredited by National Assessment and Accreditation Council of India, hence the standard of education and faculties in these colleges are generally behind to be the best. The study used a questionnaire and the results revealed that faculty have a low perception on the collection, services, ICT facilities, manpower and infrastructure facilities of libraries in these colleges. Higher Education in India India's higher education system is the second largest in the world, after the United States. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission, which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the Centre and the State. Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 12 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission. Indian higher education system has expanded at a fast pace by adding nearly 20,000 colleges and more than 8 million students in a decade from 2000-01 to 2010-11. As of 2011, India has 42 central universities, 275 state universities, 130 deemed universities, 90 private institution, 5 institutions established and functioning under the State Act, and 33government degree colleges and private degree colleges, including 1800 exclusive women's colleges, functioning under these universities and institutions as reported by the UGC in 2012. Autonomous System in Higher Education Highlighting the importance of autonomous colleges, the UGC document on the XI Plan profile of higher education in India clearly states that: ""The only safe and better way to improve the quality of undergraduate education is to the link most of the colleges from the affiliating structure. Colleges with academic and operative freedom are doing better and have more credibility. The financial support to such colleges boosts the concept of autonomy. It is proposed to increase the number of autonomous colleges to spread the culture of autonomy, and the target is to make 10 per cent of eligible colleges autonomous by the end of the XI Plan period. Objectives of Autonomy The National Policy on Education (1986-92) formulated the following objectives for autonomous colleges. An autonomous college will have the freedom to: * determine and prescribe its own courses of study and syllabi, and restructure and redesign the courses to suit local needs; and * prescribe rules for admission in consonance with the reservation policy of the state government; * evolve methods of assessment of students performance, the conduct of examinations and notification of results; * use modern tools of educational technology to achieve higher standards and greater creativity; and * promote healthy practices such as community service, extension activities projects for the benefits of the society at large, neighbourhood programmes etc. Role of College Libraries in Higher Education A college is considered as an academic institution of higher learning. In colleges, library occupies a prominent position and it is an important and integral part of the teaching programme. It is not merely a depository of books, but an active workshop instruments in the production of original thinking. The aim of college education and college libraries is interrelated. These libraries develop in each student a sense of responsibility in the pursuit of knowledge and stimulate the student to obtain, evaluate and recognize knowledge and to familiarize them with the trends of knowledge for further education and learning. Usually the classes comprise a large number of students and unlike school education, the college students get less individual attention from the teacher. The students therefore have to depend much more on the self-learning. …","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To be a successful fashion etailer, ::: companies need to overcome typical fashion challenges such as ::: seasonality, short product life cycles and a constantly changing customer ::: demand. In addition, companies must learn to master the special ::: characteristics of e-commerce such as a web-based customer interface, ::: heavy return flows and expensive last mile deliveries. The growth of ecommerce ::: has brought new challenges upon fashion supply chain ::: management. One of these is the problem of split deliveries which is both ::: costly and dissatisfying to customers. ::: Purpose The purpose of this thesis is the develop a framework for how an e-tailer, ::: like H&M Online, can reduce the number of split deliveries during an ::: ongoing season in a virtual pooling dual warehouse scenario. ::: Furthermore, to apply the framework at H&M Online to determine its ::: potential impact in a real world scenario and to find new concrete policies ::: that results in increased value for H&M Online. ::: Methodology This thesis project was conducted in two distinct phases. First, a ::: framework for reducing split deliveries in fashion e-commerce was ::: developed using a single case study at H&M Online. The framework was ::: then applied to H&M Online evaluate current decision policies and to ::: develop new better policies using an operations research approach. ::: Conclusions The number of split deliveries can be reduced by introducing new policies ::: to the four product flows that affect split deliveries; inbound deliveries, ::: transshipments, order fulfillment and returns. New policy decisions must ::: however be taken in a structured way so that other negative effects are ::: taken into consideration.

Building on an institutional framework, we argue that there are alternative pathways to compliant implementation for government agencies with limited resources. Our comparative study of 55 Mexican government agencies that were the object of the 2003 Civil Service Reform Act reveals the co-occurrence of both technocratic and institutional pathways to compliant implementation. The common denominator across pathways in organizations with limited resources was the absence of strong oppositional norms (patronage) and the presence of robust interpersonal trust. We conclude that the role played by available resources in compliant reform implementation is far from straightforward, and depends on different combinations of public organizations' endogenous characteristics.","[{""country"":[""Mexico""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Donor countries may still give aid to poorly-governed countries because of a dilemma they face: those countries most in need typically also lack proper institutions. This paper argues that donors try to resolve this dilemma by delivering aid through non-state actors. Using aid shares as well as absolute amounts of aid allocated through different channels and considering different dimensions of governance, we provide evidence that bypassing governments via NGOs and multilateral organizations is indeed a response to weak recipient state institutions. The effect is stronger in aid sectors where donors can more easily switch between channels, and for the group of donors that have been dubbed 'like-minded' to indicate their specific focus on recipient need.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We hypothesized that, even though spirituality and religiosity are closely related, spirituality and religiosity would have different and unique associations with compassion and altruism. In Study 1 and 2 we documented that more spiritual individuals experience and show greater compassion. The link between religiosity and compassion was no longer significant after controlling for the impact of spirituality. Compassion has the capacity to motivate people to transcend selfish motives and act altruistically toward strangers. Therefore, we reasoned that spirituality (but not religiosity) would predict altruistic behavior and that compassion would help explain this link. Indeed, in Studies 3, 4, and 5 we found that more spiritual individuals behaved more altruistically in economic choice and decision-making tasks, and that the tendency of spiritual individuals to feel greater compassion mediated the spirituality-to-altruism relationship. In contrast, more religious participants did not consistently feel more compassion nor behave more altruistically. Moreover, in Studies 3 and 4 we found that the broader traits of Agreeableness, Openness, and Extraversion did not help explain why more spiritual individuals behaved more altruistically. Our findings argue that spirituality—above and beyond religiosity—is uniquely associated with greater compassion and enhanced altruism toward strangers.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Like other Soviet republics whose independent histories were interrupted by Russian (later Soviet) domination, the countries in the former Soviet south only regained their independence in the 1990s. During the Soviet era, Moscow’s control over its vast, eleven time-zone-sized territory was so complete that Washington’s Soviet policy barely acknowledged the diverse ethnic, cultural, political, and religious traditions of Caucasus and Central Asia, which are vastly different from those of Russia. Nor did the region’s mineral riches garner much U.S. interest, squeezed as they were under the thumb of Russian control, with a hostile Iran and an unstable Afghanistan to the south. The messy and abrupt collapse of the Soviet Union left behind a number of newly independent states with different political traditions. Some—like Armenia or Georgia—had proud histories dating back to the time of Christ. When they emerged from ruins of the old USSR, they already possessed all the attributes that make a territory a country: a history, folklore, intelligentsia and, in some cases, ready-made governments waiting in exile. Across the Caspian Sea, however, the picture was very different. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, or Kyrgyzstan did not exist until being invented by Russian or Soviet planners. Unlike Central Europe or the western reaches of the former Soviet empire, no tradition of independent nationstates, at least along current borders, existed in Central Asia until the Russian arrival. The region’s proud city-states like Bukhara or Samarkand, which were centers of power, culture, and education in pre-Russian times, have been either destroyed or relegated to obscurity. The new borders drawn up by Russia’s imperial bureaucracy and later by Soviet planners were designed to divide more than unite. Entire ethnic groups were resettled or carved apart by borders and new ones were created, all in an attempt to create areas of permanent instability and thus guarantee the need for continued Russian or Soviet military and political presence. All this made creating a U.S. policy toward the former Soviet south a nightmarish task. Each state or group of states represented a bundle of different problems. The transition to independence was anything but smooth, with civil wars breaking out in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. The United States not only faced the task of defining a coherent role for itself in the area, it also often struggled to simply keep up with the waves of violence that toppled governments","[{""country"":[""Russian Federation""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Applying metacognitive strategy or self-regulatory learning method, this study uses students’ evaluation results, assignments, and reflection notes as data sources. It aims to find out to what extent reading and subsequently writing poems about the environment can raise students’ awareness to care for the sustainability of earth resources. The present study reveals that, firstly, there is a lack of concern for the care of the earth, proven by the students’ choice of poems to read and write. Secondly, the study shows that self-regulatory learning is suitable to implement here as shown from the students’ expanding interests to deal critically with people-nature relationships through poetry reading and writing at the later stage. This study concludes that Ecohumanism as an educational paradigm can establish rationale to include ecology in language and literature teaching. The “what, how, why, and what next” in language and literature teaching should then be geared and habituated continually towards respecting Earth in this mutually dependent world.","[{""country"":[""Indonesia""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Findings – Based on a critical review of extant factoring scholarship, it was deduced that factoring has been effective enough to elicit a growing rate of adoption across the continents, despite the costs of adoption, as well as the 2009-2014 global financial crisis, excluding only North America where there seems to be a constant decline in adoption rate.

Does the effect of social security on fertility differ by income? How does social security change the cross-sectional relationship between fertility and income? Does social security further affect the dynamics of the earnings distribution by changing differential fertility? We answer these questions in a three-period OLG model with heterogeneous agents and endogenous fertility. We argue that given its redistributional property, social security affects people's fertility behavior differentially by income. In the model, earning ability is transmitted from parents to children. Hence, social security can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the earnings distribution through its effects on differential fertility. The mechanism used in the model to generate differential fertility is novel. We follow the line of the ""old-age security"" hypothesis and assume that children are an investment good in parents' old-age consumption. Thus,the optimal fertility choice depends on how much transfer is expected from children in relation to the cost of rearing these children to adult life. Since the intergenerational earnings process is mean-reverting, poor (rich) parents tend to have more (fewer) children because they have lower (higher) child-rearing cost and expect their children will have higher (lower) earnings than themselves and give back relatively more (less) in transfers. Social security reduces fertility by substituting children out of parents' old-age portfolio. It reduces fertility of the poor proportionally more than it reduces fertility of the rich because social security payments are a larger portion of old-age savings for poor people. These results are consistent with features of the U.S. fertility data. We calibrate the model to the U.S. data and find that social security can explain 32% of the decline in poor-rich fertility differential between the cohort of women born during 1891-1895 and the cohort of women born during 1946-1950.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Yet, as we show using Census data from 1990, 2000, and 2009–2011, immigrants are substantially underrepresented in federal, state, and local governments. To understand why, we use logit analysis for federal and for state and local government employment in each time period to test whether immigrants’ weaker educational attainment and English proficiency, lower probabilities of being citizens and military veterans, and different age, gender, and race/ethnicity distributions can explain that underrepresentation. Disparities in education and preferential government treatment of veterans are factors, but citizenship requirements appear to be the major obstacle to immigrant employment in the public sector.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Looking at the prominence of the issue in the national and international political agendas and the volume of media coverage that it has sustained in the last five years or so one is led to believe that things have changed. A series of remarkable events has contributed to transform climate change into one of the most high profile issues of the present moment: hurricane Katrina, Al Gore’s film and book An Inconvenient Truth, the Nobel prize that was awarded jointly to him and to the IPCC, the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, Live Earth, and the gloomy forecasts of the 4 th IPCC Assessment Report all concurred to putting climate change on the media, the public’s and the political agendas, which then tend to feed each other. In fact, multiple surveys indicate that people around the world are aware of the issue and very concerned, are willing to act upon it and expect politicians to take the lead. Yet, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise rapidly. The scientific, political and economic complexity of climate change brings up a number of challenges for communication, which are enhanced by the multiple time and spatial scales of the problem, the ethical, social and cultural values involved in decisions, and the urgent need for concerted action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. As recently shown by Moser and Dilling (2007), promoting social change to address climate change faces a number of hurdles but is ever more pressing. In this context, a number of questions beg for answers: What are the meanings associated with climate change in different parts of the world and how have those meanings been produced, reproduced and transformed? How have the media in different countries been representing this issue? How do people perceive it and to what extent are they integrating it into their actions? To what extent is climate change making us rethink our practices of consumption and mobility? What are the relations between political action or inaction and given forms of discursive construction of climate change?","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Motivation is thought to be responsible for ""why people decide to do something, how long they are willing to sustain the activity and how hard they are going to pursue it"" (Dornyei,2001a:8). Motivation refers in a general sense to a process involved in the initiation, direction and energization of individual behaviour. Teacher’s motivation and opportunities for professional development have been linked closely to certain fundamental conditions of teaching. Independent of the cognitive abilities & personal dispositions of individuals. The present study is intended to study the effect of work motivation on change proneness of school teachers in context to gender. The sample taken for the study is 600 out of which 300 male and 300 female school teachers. The result on ANOVA calculation is not significant at 0.05 level of significance. Change-proneness means inclination or readiness one has to change or alter his behaviour, attitudes, feelings and thoughts by being flexible rather restraining oneself to be rigid (Mukhopadhyaya, 1981). The tendency to accept anything, which is new, novel, to be imbibed in their style of work is change proneness. Change-proneness means inclination or readiness one has to change or alter his behaviour, attitudes, feelings and thoughts by being flexible rather restraining oneself to be rigid (Mukhopadhyaya, 1981). Miller (1967) first coined the concept of change-proneness is the congregations effect of curiosity, open mindedness and mental flexibility. Those who take risk in introducing new strategies imbibe new ideas and with a high change prone attitude may originate new ideas. It is a sense of satisfaction, commitment and success in the quest for new techniques, ideals and methods. Change-Proneness is defined as a state of flux and dilemma brought about by devotion to a cause or a way of life which may promote to result at expected rewards or fails to produce unexpected revolts. Teacher at his best should be active not reactive, must strive rather than submit, he must be author of his behaviour rather than have it dictated by authority. The teacher should perform his duties in his own style. The pattern of functioning of teachers reveals the existence of two categories of teachers – being very flexible in approach, those adopt new strategies and innovative, those who may not accept new strategies and implement novel techniques. A teacher who is committed, competent, and creative and work with excelsior spirit can drive out the darkness from the minds of pupils and make them educated cultured civilians. With all sterling qualities the teachers will make educative process effective","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We rely on a data set with 29,303 observations from 94 European Fortune Global 500 companies operating across 77 countries during the period 2001‐2007. We found that MNCs are more likely to enter countries with more certain—i.e., clearer and more stable—environmental regulations than those of their home countries. Results also suggest that there is a higher level of MNC entry into foreign countries with environmental regulations that are more stringent than those of their home countries. This finding challenges the controversial but commonly held view that more stringent environmental regulations deter MNCs’ FME investments. Notably, the magnitude of the regulatory certainty relationship with MNCs’ FME investments is larger than that of regulatory stringency. Findings also indicate that the increased tendency of MNCs to enter countries with more stringent environmental regulations is higher in more democratic countries and for cleaner industry firms.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

First, he restated that the United States will not allow safe haven from which al Qaeda or its affiliates can launch attacks against our homeland or our allies. Second, the United States will support an Afghan-led reconciliation with the Taliban to achieve a political settlement. President Obama framed this policy with a date of 2014 for the transition of security to the government of Afghanistan. In December 2011, during an interview with Newsweek, Vice-President Biden provided additional insight into the administration's Afghanistan objectives and what might be an acceptable outcome. First, the United States will maintain pressure on al Qaeda. Second, the Government of Afghanistan must be in a strong and secure position to negotiate with the Taliban. Lastly, Biden stated, we are in a position where if Afghanistan ceased and desisted from being a haven for people who do damage and have as a target the United States of America and their allies, that's good enough. Neither official described the defeat of the Taliban as an objective of the United States. Both leaders clearly articulated the intent to seek reconciliation with an assurance that Afghanistan will not become a safe haven for transnational terrorists. This paper will argue that a political settlement by 2014 is unlikely because of the inherent political complexity in Afghanistan. Specifically, the current security situation, uncertainty surrounding the future of coalition forces and Afghan leadership, and the interest of Afghan minorities and regional actors makes a political settlement by 2014 unlikely. The paper will identify five significant obstacles to the peace process. To overcome these obstacles, the U.S. Government will need to take a greater role in Afghan-led negotiations. The paper proposes three changes to U.S. policy to facilitate a lasting transition in 2014.","[{""country"":[""Middle East & North Africa"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this paper, a unidimensional measure of technostress is created and validated in two different samples. In addition, based on the Affective Response Model, the technology induced state anxiety (TISA) concept is introduced and conceptually distinguished from computer anxiety and technostress. The discriminant validity of TISA, technostress and computer anxiety is tested in a nomological net of antecedents and objective technology performance outcomes using an experimental design. PLS modeling is used to test several hypotheses, the majority of which are supported. This work forms an important step in further understanding negative affective concepts related to technology use, and devising intervention mechanisms.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The purpose of this paper is to explore the challenges for developing innovative, more people-oriented approaches to leadership in a command environment like the police. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Design/methodology/approach ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: A case study approach in one UK police constabulary was adopted. In all, 38 semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior police officers from chief constable to inspector rank.

Perceptions of the situation, particularly in terms of perceived risk and visibility, influenced leadership practices in the constabulary. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Originality/value ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Current research and policy places emphasis on “what works” in police leadership; the meanings of leadership to police officers is overshadowed by a focus on effectiveness. Through the use of semi-structured interviews, this research captures police leaders’ understandings of themselves and their leadership. The findings reveal that, at a time when police leadership needs to become more innovative and people focussed, the pressures and complexities of contemporary policing mean that police officers retreat to leadership that is command-based and driven by the primacy of business needs.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The resultant shifts in government policies and programs have consequences on all aspects of the country’s socio-economic, political and technological development. Industrial relations constitute one of the most delicate and complex problems of the modern society which merits national concern for proper examination and balancing. Tracing government intervention in Nigerian industrial relations, this paper weighs the contributions of military dictators and their civilian counterparts to the growth of Nigerian industrial relations. With an historical account of how government’s principle of voluntarism metamorphosed into principle of interventionism, the paper identifies and quantifies policy actions of both military and civilian governments which significantly, contributed to the Nigerian model of industrial relations today. Despite the worldwide condemnation of the military for its involvement in industrial relations politics, its achievements outweigh that of its civilian counterparts. It is, therefore, recommended that being the most desirable form of government, the Nigerian civilian government should be more pragmatic in policy formulation and implementation that is capable of ensuring long-lasting harmonious industrial relations while curtailing acrimonies and rifts in industrial relations.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Interval parameter programming is applied in combination with cooperative game theoretic concepts such as Shapley values and the Nucleolus to provide mutually beneficial solutions for water allocation problems under uncertainty. The allocation problem consists of two steps: water resources are initially allocated to water users based on the Nash bargaining model and the achieved nonlinear interval parameter model is solved by transforming it into a problem with a deterministic weighted objective function. Water amounts and net benefits are reallocated to achieve efficient water usage through net benefit transfers. The net benefit reallocation is done by the application of different cooperative game theoretical methods. Then, the optimization problem is solved by linear interval programming and by converting it into a problem with two deterministic objective functions. The suggested model is then applied to the Zarrinehrud sub-basin, within Urmia Lake basin in Northwestern Iran. Findings suggest that a reframing of the problem using cooperative strategies within the context of water diplomacy framework - creating flexibility in water allocation using mutual gains approach - provides better outcomes for all competing users of water.","[{""country"":[""Iran, Islamic Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Six Syrian and Egyptian community workers are interviewed and a structure-actor analysis is conducted. With the help of scholars such as Sara Ahmed, Etienne Balibar, Engin Isin and Bridget Anderson, three structures are identified: a social structures that constructs the immigrated as Others, a class structure that pushes the immigrated towards economic exclusion and poverty, and a political structures that pushes the immigrated out of the political, with limited rights and opportunities. The paper finds that a new vocabulary on integration is needed: by perceiving integration as equality, the integration process is to be understood as a political struggle for rights in an unequal society.","[{""country"":[""Europe & Central Asia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This paper joins those analyses that argue that the crisis reveals flaws in the theoretical underpinnings of capital market regulation, particularly in those markets that had relied upon the assumptions of ‘market fundamentalism’ as a regulatory philosophy. We suggest a more Northern European approach to market regulation better accommodates the social values necessary to ensure stable, equitable economies. In these approaches, economic actors make decisions after having consulted relevant stakeholders. By taking this view, we challenge the tendency in Anglo-American regulatory theory to rely on the self-interest of market participants as an adequate substitute for external constraints on risk-creating activity, and we challenge the perspective that suggests that the financial system can be thought of as properly separate from social values and considerations. In various Northern European countries corporate governance systems have been developed in which the management has legal requirements to interact with various stakeholder groups, enabling broader social values than shareholder wealth maximizing to be considered within the market sphere. We argue that these systems offer inspiration for market reform. In making this argument we do not idealise the legal systems of these countries, which also have their weaknesses. Our argument is that there are aspects of Northern European stakeholder governance, specifically Dutch corporate governance, that represent means by which the law can be used to allow markets to better incorporate social values. We conclude with a number of policy suggestions for incorporating such corporate governance values into capital market regulation.","[{""country"":[""Europe & Central Asia""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Until the summer of 1990, Bosnia and Herzegovina was one of the six republics of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ), which differed from the others because its population consisted of three equal nations. It November 1943 Bosnia and Herzegovina was defined as “neither Serbian, nor Croatian, nor Muslim – but at the same time Serbian, and Croatian, and Muslim” with a complete equality of all the “Serbs, Muslims, and Croats”.1 It was in that fashion that the solution of the national issue was proclaimed, and such Bosnia and Herzegovina existed from 1945 to 1990. The claim that the national issues had been solved was undisputable until mid-eighties, when the oppressive system displayed obvious signs of caving in. Towards the end of the eighties the intellectual representatives of all three nations claimed, for the purposes of daily politics, that they had been subjugated and downtrodden during SFRJ, which is an implausible statement.

In this paper, we utilize 2009 Nationwide Highway Travel Survey data and test the relationship between area commute-time means as well as variances in metropolitan-area size. We include tests for metropolitan areas as a whole and for residents from urban, suburban, second city, and town-and-county areas. The regression analysis shows that all estimated slopes are statistically significant but not much greater than zero. Commute time means and variances are highly correlated. These relationships are also invariant with respect to the place of residence. An extensive collection of literature provides evidence for the co-location of workers and jobs hypothesis: average commute times do not rise appreciably as metropolitan population increases. We conclude that these results are additional, although indirect, evidence for the co-location hypothesis.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This discussion centres on those civil wars that are primarily political in nature – conflicts that concern the supreme executive power in a given state. Although civil wars can have obvious winners and losers militarily, the judgment of international actors can often be decisive. The purpose of this paper is to examine the way in which international actors decide who holds the sovereign authority of a state during civil wars and what is needed to ‘win’ such wars in the eyes of the international community. Existing theories stress effective control over territory or the political interests of the recognising states. However, my hypothesis is that states observe a rule of recognition that equates control of the capital city with possession of a state’s sovereign authority. I examine four civil wars in order to test these three theories and in all four cases control of the capital city is shown to be necessary for recognition by other governments. Effective control and political expediency demonstrate less explanatory power. The second part of the paper investigates the possible reasons why capital cities should be so significant in civil wars and considers the arguments for the special circumstances of the African state and for the economic significance of capital cities. However, it is the symbolic value of capital cities and, more importantly, the long-standing perspective in military history that views capitals as political and territorial proxies for states, that explain the recognition pattern in civil wars. The conclusion argues that the merits of this practice of recognition should be debated, as should the ‘de-certification’ of capital cities as a way of changing the incentive structure of some civil wars.","[{""country"":[""Africa""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In the following we will report the results of four experiments with the headturn preference/discrimination paradigm we conducted with German infants between 4 and 6 months of age and with French infants at 6 months of age. Our study addresses the question of whether during this developmental period we can already find evidence that infants have determined the predominant trochaic pattern for bisyllabic words in their surrounding language. We presented 6- and 4-month-olds with trochaic or iambic bisyllabics in German and 6 month-olds with same stimuli in French. The German 6-month-olds showed a listening preference for the trochaic pattern, but not the German 4-month-olds nor the French 6-month-olds. However, 6-month-old French infants were able to discriminate trochaic from iambic bisyllabics. This suggests that the preference for the language dominant pattern of word stress arises between the age of 4 and 6 months in German. In French, in which there is little if any accentuation at the lexical level, French-learning 6-month-olds do not show a preference for any stress pattern, but they are sensitive to acoustic differences between trochaic and iambic bisyllables.","[{""country"":[""France"",""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The aims of this study are twofold: i) to explore how different causal conditions related to these factors combine in explaining the use of MCS, and ii) how these combinations of causal conditions differ when comparing the MCS that relate to planning with those that relate to evaluation. Based on survey data from a sample of high-tech start-ups, this study seeks to meet these objectives through quantitative and qualitative research methods. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the adoption of MCS by start-ups. The findings demonstrate the relevance of the configurational analytical technique when simultaneously exploring the internal and external factors that lead to adoption.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A model of structural equations using the Partial Least Squares technique was applied to a database composed of 191 small business owners in Paraguay. The results show that personal values of conservation and self-enhancement in the entrepreneur have a direct negative effect on innovation. It is also noted that entrepreneurial attitudes, such as openness to change and self-transcendence, have a mediating role in the positive impact of values on innovation. The article contributes to the literature by showing that some elements of intellectual capital, such as entrepreneurial attitudes and entrepreneurs’ personal values, interact to influence innovation in small businesses.","[{""country"":[""Paraguay""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The off-duty misbehavior of police is an important concern for police agencies exposed to potential liability costs, and scholars engaged in debates about whether studies on police deviance should include acts committed while an officer is technically off duty. The problem for scholars interested in understanding off-duty police misconduct is that virtually all of the existing data describes the misbehavior of NYPD police. The purpose of the current study is to explore the nature and character of off-duty police crime in the United States through a content analysis of news articles on arrested off-duty police officers.

The total agrochemical residue (TR) caused by main agrochemical inputs was estimated in the study area of Qinghai province and the Tibet Autonomous Region over 1995–2017 by using the emergy synthesis method. The total agrochemical residue was decomposed into the intensity factor, the structure factor, the productivity factor, and the labour factor by using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method. The change in TR could be divided into four time periods, i.e., a rapidly increasing period during 1995–1998, a stable period during 1999–2004, a slowly increasing period during 2005–2011, and a fluctuant period during 2012–2017. The study area had a mean TR intensity in area (TRA) of 3.31 × 1014 sej/ha, which was only 38.21% of that in China; however, the annual growth rate of TRA in the study area was 2.93%, higher than the rate of 1.91% in China over 1995–2017. The study area had a mean TR intensity in production (TRP) of 4.06 × 1010 sej/CNY (Chinese Yuan), which was 71.05% of that in China; however, the annual decreasing rate of TRP in the study area was 0.95%, lower than the rate of 1.98% in China over 1995–2017. All the LMDI decomposed factors contributed to the TR increase during 1995–1998; the intensity factor, the structure factor, and the labour factor contributed to the TR decrease during 1999–2004; the structure factor and the productivity factor contributed to the TR increase during 2005–2011; and only the productivity factor contributed to the TR increase during 2012–2017.

Forms of collaboration include partnerships, alliances and joint ventures. Infrastructure projects in Hong Kong often require clusters of resources, skills and capabilities that are difficult to obtain for any single organization to source using in-house resources. Large infrastructure providers have sought to overcome this problem by forming joint ventures (JVs) and other forms of relationships to co-operatively undertake these projects. One motivation for establishing these relationships is to spread financial and other risk. Another motivation is to capture learning so that this hidden and intangible asset may applied later to improve their competitive advantage. Results from a pilot study investigating the nature of the JV relationship in Hong Kong are reported upon in this paper. This research focused upon organizational learning intentions of interviewed JV representatives. It explored why learning from JV partners was deemed important by respondents and intended strategies that facilitate this learning. Results indicate that respondents have a strong strategic desire for learning from partners in collaborative relations that deliver these projects.","[{""country"":[""Hong Kong SAR, China""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

From a Reformed Christian perspective, a critical question is: To what extent is the political culture infused by the Biblical imperatives of brotherly love, respect and compassion? Given the growing use of adversarial political advertising the following two questions arise and are specifically addressed: • Could it realistically be expected of Christian political communicators in a secular country such as South Africa to communicate with full respect to people at all times, or should they be excused if they try to win at all costs? and • How do political theorists view the issue? In answering these questions, social responsibility and the need for social harmony as precondition for free and fair political activities, as well as a Biblical perspective on communication are addressed. In view of these theoretical points of departure the role of emotional messages is discussed and evaluated. It is argued that all advertising, but specifically political advertising in an emotionally charged atmosphere such as an election campaign, could have a direct negative impact on social harmony and is therefore Biblically unacceptable. Examples from previous South African general elections are discussed and evaluated from a Biblical viewpoint. It is argued that parties should not merely campaign with the aim of winning an election, but rather with the intention of respecting voters while campaigning. Simultaneously they could promote democracy within a fragile social context. Any victory outside of these parameters will not stand the test of a Biblical critique. However, it would seem extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe in any detail which types of negative advertisements are acceptable and which are not.","[{""country"":[""South Africa""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this article, a qualitative analysis of accounts relating to heterosexual experiences obtained from 25 menopausal women in Ireland through in-depth interviews is presented and considered in light of existing theoretical perspectives on sexuality. The average age of women in the sample was 54.2 years, and a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds was represented. We found that in describing their contemporary sexual experiences, contextual issues were brought heavily to bear as participants drew on discourses of personal history and biography, including previous relationships, to explain their current sexual experiences.

This title is based on original analysis of how decisions are made about the relevance of information and the other resources used in learning, showing how society has privileged objective approaches (used in rule-based decision making) to the detriment of subjective and intersubjective perspectives which promote individual and community contexts. The book goes on to analyse the academic and popular DMIL literature, showing how the field may have been, consciously or unwittingly, complicit in the ?objectification? of learning and the disempowerment of individuals and communities.

This is mainly because there is usually just one teacher who is in the position to rate the work of a group over time. Hence it is not possible in these circumstances to determine the reliability of teacher ratings. The reliability of multiple peer ratings can be estimated, however, through traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. This paper employs a novel application of ANOVA techniques to compare the reliability of multiple peer ratings with single tutor ratings. The method is outlined and demonstrated by application to rating data from two different courses. Both involved sets of multiple peer and individual tutor ratings from parallel classes that were used to assess student contributions to group process work. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed in terms both of the application of the technique and the findings from the two case studies.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Implementation was largely through the use of catalogues intended to signal and to formally accredit the supply and demand of technologically-oriented products. This paper reviews these experiences by examining the wider context and three case studies. Accreditation is shown to carry a risk of protectionism. Signaling performs a function analogous to a technology roadmap and was assisted by giving listed technologies priority for public procurement. For both types of instrument the intended mechanism did not work as planned but the broader role they sought to fill was an important factor in bringing innovations to market. The appropriateness and effectiveness of such instruments are shown to be dependent upon the state of both the innovation and the procurement systems in which they are set.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Participatory group exercises combined with individual interviews in two rural villages provided personal stories about jobs/businesses that the young people were engaged in, as well as previous experiences and future plans. Constraints as well as enabling factors working at individual and structural levels were analysed. Policies intended to address the needs of young people tend to seek to target the most vulnerable, often on the basis of individual and household level characteristics (e.g. women, orphans, AIDS-affected households). We argue that this a) neglects the structural factors operating at national and global levels and b) fails to recognise that factors interact to produce vulnerability rather than this being rooted in separate characteristics. We demonstrate that an intersectional approach, drawn from feminist studies, is a useful theoretical lens, which in combination with a livelihoods perspective helps illuminate the needs of rural young people. In situations characterized by high levels of poverty and multiple vulnerabilities, we argue that it can be costly and ineffective to try to decide ‘who is most vulnerable’, rather, resources can be more effectively spent in trying to improve conditions that will benefit all rural young people.","[{""country"":[""Lesotho"",""Malawi""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It was found out that achievement in the Senior School Certificate English Language examination and Use of English course at the university contribute significantly to the variance in students’ academic performance in specific courses of study; significant differences exist in the academic achievement of students in various faculties in the Senior School Certificate English Language examination; faculty of study does not significantly influence students’ academic achievement in Use of English, and faculty of study does not significantly influence academic performances in specific courses of study.

The continued hazard that tsunamis and related phenomena present was emphasised in the second half of 2018 when three separate tsunamis struck Indonesia (twice) and New Caledonia and Vanuatu. Each of these events highlighted different difficulties in providing effective early warning of tsunamis, in particular each featured a failure of either: (1) tsunami/wave detection; (2) warning dissemination; or (3) accurate and rapid appraisal of a detected event, so that a warning could be issued for dissemination. In this paper we describe our work to date on solving these three problems, building on our past work in this space. For warning dissemination we describe the proposed low-cost Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) Lali warning dissemination system. For event detection we describe a concept for low-cost (including maintenance) tsunami detection networks, utilising advances in low-cost autonomous underwater vehicles. For rapid event evaluation and warning release, we describe the planned ETC Lali Control Portal. Together, these three related innovations have the potential to transform not only tsunami early warning, but also the provision of early warning to a variety of other hazards, thus providing a path towards the reduction of human, social and economic harm that these events cause, and thus hopefully improving the prosperity and resilience of coastal and island communities around the world.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The reform only applied to firms established after January 2002, allowing us to use regression discontinuity design as the identification strategy. The results show that lower taxes improved both quantity and quality of firm innovation. Moreover, the reform has a bigger impact on firms that are financially constrained and firms that engage more in tax evasion.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We draw parallels to the business case for commercial software products (COTS). Compared with COTS, OSS products seem to have several advantages, but based on existing literature and a case study, we develop and discuss the hypothesis that a major barrier may be the “customer's” uncertainty and unfamiliarity with OSS vendor relationships. We find that corporate governance and architecture needs to be accounted for in both COTS and OSS.

The non‐parametric estimates using parental education as a measure of circumstances reveal that the opportunity share of earnings inequality in 2004–05 was 11–19 percent for urban India and 5–8 percent for rural India. The same figures for consumption expenditure inequality are 10–19 percent for urban India and 5–9 percent for rural India. The overall opportunity share estimates (parametric) of earnings inequality due to circumstances, including caste, religion, region, parental education, and parental occupation, vary from 18 to 26 percent for urban India, and from 16 to 21 percent for rural India. The overall opportunity share estimates for consumption expenditure inequality are close to the earnings inequality figures for both urban and rural areas. The analysis further finds evidence that the parental education specific opportunity share of overall earnings (and consumption expenditure) inequality is largest in urban India, but caste and geographical region also play an equally important role when rural India is considered.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Recently, researchers have demonstrated that making judgments of learning (JOLs) can enhance students’ short-term performance; however, it is unclear how they influence long-term learning. We evaluated this issue in three experiments. Participants studied related word pairs (e.g., castle–king). Half of the participants made a JOL for each pair and half did not. Participants took a cued-recall test after either a long retention interval (2 days) or short retention interval (3 min). Participants who made JOLs outperformed participants who did not, which was evident on long-term learning as well as short-term performance. Continuously cumulating meta-analyses revealed that these effects were strong (long-term learning, d = .66; short-term performance, d = .71). Thus, making JOLs appears to be an effective strategy to increase long-term retention of related information.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To this end, we use survey data on the organization of small business lending, collected at the end of 2006 on a sample of about 300 Italian banks, combined with balance sheet data drawn from the Bank of Italy's Supervisory Reports. Focusing on acquisition effects and controlling for size, performance and organizational characteristics, we find evidence of higher decision‐making powers in granting credit to SMEs for the main hierarchical layers of acquired banks. In particular, the powers of both the branch loan officer and the Chief Executive Officer are larger for target banks recently involved in a deal. Entering a group moves power delegated to both ends of the hierarchy within the target bank towards the higher levels shown by the bidder, to merge different cultures and credit policies. This effect appears immediately after the deal; it is persistent after a three‐year period and it is stronger if the geographical reach of the target bank is well known by the bidder. However, higher decisional lending power within the target bank is balanced by increasing branch managers’ turnover consistently with the rising monitoring costs due to growing organizations’ higher risk of losing control over decisions.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

On this premise, this study reports evidence from numeracy-related interactions between parents and their four-year-old child during cookery sessions at home. Numeracy group parents who received instructions to incorporate additional mathematics into the activity provided significantly more numeracy guidance and also created more opportunities for their children to practice advanced mathematics. Comparison group parents provided enough numeracy guidance to complete the recipe but rarely provided extensive or advanced numeracy guidance. Children in the numeracy group generated significantly more correct math responses during the activity than comparison group children, though there were no significant differences on the post-test. The findings suggest the need to raise parental awareness of opportunities to support and encourage mathematics in activities at home.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this respect, open government can constitute a way to re-connect citizens and political institutions, but at the same time, it can also be an “appealing” tool to institutionalize bottom-up participation and so anesthetizing it. The aim of this article is to present the first findings of an international research project about open government and participatory platforms in four European countries (France, Italy, Spain, the UK).

The paper traces these advocacy activities in four key problem areas for Russia's implementation of the Convention: (1) domestic judges' knowledge and citation of the European Convention or ECtHR case law; (2) the execution of domestic court judgments by Russian state bureaucratic bodies; (3) extrajudicial disappearances and killings in anti-terrorist military operations in the North Caucasus; and (4) torture or inhumane treatment in police detention. The author finds that the impact Russian NGOs can have upon domestic implementation depends greatly upon the professional cultures and incentives of the actors involved as well as whether or not prevention of violations is compatible with other high-level Russian government agendas.","[{""country"":[""Euro area"",""Russian Federation""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Due to the highly visual nature of the driving task, the impact of aging on visual function is of particular interest in the context of road safety. Although it has been suggested that older drivers compensate for the decline in their driving abilities, there has been little research which has related the compensatory driving behaviours to actual driving measures of elderly drivers who have visual impairment resulting from eye disease. In addition, current research on the driving performance of people with eye disease is limited. Importantly, it has been reported that people with eye disease often have limited insight into their condition and hence are unlikely to compensate for it. This study aims to address several issues: what impact does eye disease have on driving behaviour, is the impact of eye disease on driving mediated by awareness, and what compensatory behaviours do drivers with eye disease display compared to age-matched controls? Participants were elderly people with glaucoma who were currently driving. Driving related information was collected with questionnaires included the Activities of Daily Vision Scale, Driver Behaviour Questionnaire and a Driving Exposure questionnaire. Visual function tests included visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual fields and tests of glare sensitivity. Driving performance was assessed on a closed road circuit. Data collected to date indicates little correlation between self-rated ability and actual performance. Drivers with visual impairment perform worse at driving tasks such as obstacle avoidance and sign detection. It is envisaged that this study will guide policy decisions concerning advice for drivers with eye disease.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Motives relating to home and residential environment triggered mi-gration to the countryside: building/buying a one-family house and relation to nature as well as changes in economic situation: unemployment and over indebtedness. Voluntary migration to the countryside, living in a one-family house, economic security and good relations with neighbours guar-anteed that the migrants were satisfied with the village where they lived. Positive reputation of migrants, easy inter-action and participation in village life contributed to gaining a positive position in the village community.","[{""country"":[""Finland""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

An economic update on Cameroon with a focus on telecoms","This Cameroon economic update, the World Bank is launching a program of short, crisp and more frequent country economic reports. These economic updates will analyze the trends and constraints in Cameroon's economic development. Each issue, produced bi-annually, will provide an update of recent economic developments as well as a special focus on a selected topical issue. The economic updates aim to share knowledge and stimulate debate among those interested in improving the economic management of Cameroon and unleashing its enormous potential. The notes thereby offer another voice on economic issues in Cameroon, and an additional platform for engagement, learning and change. The report's special focus on the telecommunication sector. Cameroon has been hit by the global economic and financial crisis over the past two years, as reflected in steep declines in the price and demand for its export commodities including oil, timber, rubber, cotton and aluminum. However, the upturn in the global economy and measures taken by the authorities to stimulate domestic production, preliminary indications suggest that economic activity is recovering. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2010 is estimated to have reached 3 percent on the back of stronger non-oil activities, which expanded by about 4 percent (particularly food crops, forestry, construction, transport, and telecoms). Data on private credit growth corroborate this assessment. Cameroon is a relatively small and mature oil producer, where oil production is declining. Depleting reserves, aging equipment, and more recently postponements of some development projects and investments because of the financial crisis explain this profile. The contribution of this sector to GDP growth has been mostly negative in recent years: oil production is estimated to have contracted by a further 16 percent in 2010 (to 23.2 million barrels).","[{""country"":[""Cameroon""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In these clusters the activities of R&D, product design, production, distribution, and system integration may be split up among hundreds or even thousands of firms. Different firms will design and produce the different components of a complex artifact (like the processor, peripherals, and software of a computer system), and different firms will specialize in different stages of a complex production process. This paper considers the pricing behavior and profitability of these so-called modular clusters. In particular, we investigate a possibility hinted at in prior work: that for composite goods, a vertical pricing externality operating across complements can offset horizontal competition between substitutes. In this paper, we isolate the offsetting price effects and show how they operate in large (as well as small) clusters. We argue that it is possible in principle for a modular cluster of firms to mimic the pricing behavior and profitability of a vertically integrated monopoly. We then use our model to compare open and closed standards regimes, to understand how commoditization affects a cluster, to determine the relative profits of platform firms and firms that depend on the platform, and to assess the impact of horizontal and vertical mergers. Our model highlights a collective action problem: what is good for an individual firm is often not good for the cluster. We speculate that this conflict may be a source of strategic tension in platform firms.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Visual representations form part of a corporate identity, which in turn is linked to the building of a reputation. Jointstock banks, as new entrants and a new type of financial institution, faced fierce opposition. Portraiture, as a well-established art form, projected a historical legacy that did not, as yet, exist. Through portraiture, banks solidified and added to the sitter’s social standing and signalled the new institution’s reputation for high culture, power and professionalism to those viewing these works within a localised social hierarchy and business environment.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We also examine whether local area effects such as urbanicity, housing or labour market factors are significant. Our analyses of individuals aged 18-24 indicate that although parental background and circumstances can contribute to young adults’ propensity to return home, this is far outweighed by the impact of the individual-level characteristics of the young adults themselves. Of particular importance in promoting returns to the parental home are experiencing a change in economic activity,especially moving out of full-time education into unemployment, and experiencing a partnership dissolution. Whilst local house prices are shown to be related to the propensity to return home for women, most contextual factors are found to have little effect for either men or women.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, no consensus seems to exist about the proper roles and actual effects of information technology in dynamics of socioeconomic development. Many countries around the world have seen great opportunities in implementing initiatives that would increase the ICT adoption in different areas, especially in the government. Developed countries have exploited their ICT infrastructure for implementing success projects, while developing countries are launching their own ICT based initiatives hoping to achieve a considerable impact in the society in a relatively short term. The present research is oriented to study the implications of ICT policies for enhancing the quality of life in developing countries, especially in the Latin American countries. This paper reviews some important efforts in the deployment of ICT initiative in Peru. The contribution from a research perspective is to report on some key lessons learnt and propose a set of recommendations for future implementations in similar developing nations’ environments.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is a holding ability to absorb, adapt and transform a given technology into the operational, managerial and assignable routines that may lead to revenue. The interaction of various elements like ::: strategy, resources, and processes as innovation capability enables the success of the entire quality performance in the ::: automotive industry. The improvement of quality performance is a vital source of competition among the automotive service ::: centres. The quality performance in automotive service centres usually refers to the service quality in marketing term. To differentiate companies’ strategy, managers have to look into the new idea from external sources especially customers. ::: External sources such as customer knowledge are significant and noteworthy because the customer is now more active and ::: innovative in the service encounter. The communication among the customers and organisations around the world can be very efficient through the power of technology. Although this issue is essential, however, the number of studies related to the importance of customer knowledge management among managers in the automotive service centres are still lacking in the country. To solve this problem, the primary goal of this study is to investigate the relationship of customer knowledge management and service innovation capability; and to identify the factors that can affect the level of quality performance of the automotive service centres in Malaysia. The previous studies have confirmed that customer knowledge management has a significant effect on service innovation capability, while service innovation capability also has a positive relationship with the increasing level of quality performance. It proposed that service innovation research be regularly conducted in the organisation and organising events with customers to be actively involved in product and service design. This initiative should be given to new managers and poorly performing service centres. This paper is expected to assist academician, practitioners and local car manufacturer service centres in understanding knowledge sharing concept and enhancing quality performance among automotive service centres in Malaysia.","[{""country"":[""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It demonstrates that office-seeking parties and especially the representatives of the executive power generally dominate Europeanized debates. In contrast, peripheral parties and other party actors such as party MPs and extra-parliamentary politicians face significant difficulties in obtaining visibility and resonance for their Europeanized frames. The empirical and longitudinal analysis also shows the prevalence of claims directed towards the EU level and of nationalized debates over Europe. Overall, even though critical engagements with Europe have progressed over time, the domination of mainstream parties and party actors in framing European integration and the pro-European consensus between office-seeking parties nevertheless limit the potential for contestation on European matters.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The paper examines and describes different categories of the linguistic taboos in the Pashtoon society and the strategies used by the Pashto speakers to avoid the use of these words through different types of replacement of taboo words with more acceptable words such as using jargon terms, euphemisms, metaphoric expressions, and use of English terms. The paper also argues that these processes are conditioned by the cultural and religious norms of the society. It also offers an explanation as to why certain words are considered taboos in the society and why certain taboo words are accompanied by particular conventionally-fixed words. The taboo words in the Pashtoon society have also been divided into two categories (general and context-specific) each with subcategories. The paper adopts the ""politeness"" approach proposed by Brown and Levinson (1978, 1987) as the theoretical framework for the analysis of linguistic taboos in the Pashtoon society.","[{""country"":[""Iran, Islamic Rep."",""Pakistan"",""Tajikistan""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In addition, literature on the state of mathematics in society indicates that the changing nature of the student population and attitudes of professionals towards teaching and learning has led to the identification of a key set of issues which are in the process of being addressed. These include the dramatic fall in the number of students who were studying A-level and Further Mathematics; the declining number and quality of students entering degree programmes with a strong mathematical element; the lack of qualified mathematics teachers and the need for changes to the mathematics curriculum. ::: ::: This report outlines the specific ways in which one institution is tackling the issues through the development of a university course for non mathematics graduates aiming to become teachers; the provision of Further Mathematics courses for students pre-entry; and the addition of mathematics education and teaching options to the final year modules for students studying mathematics at the university. It demonstrates how the university as an institution, its students and the local community in particular are benefiting from this civic university approach.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However most airlines have very little understanding of their customers yet have a little knowledge about their most valuable passengers. This study is aimed to analyze financial aspects of customer value to the company in the context of aviation loyalty reward program in Indonesia. Financial value of customers is analyzed using CLV approach. Modeling of financial value of the members to the airline is developed by performing regression analysis of CLV against RFM and the associated socio-demographic characteristics of the members. This study used secondary data of customer profiles and financial transactions of the Garuda Frequent Flyer members in 2012. The empirical findings observed in this study explain that the financial value of the frequent flyer members to the airline is influenced by RFM, Gender, Age, and Frequent Flyer Tier levels. It is also found that the RFM valuation is aligned with CLV analysis. The result contributes to the knowledge of aviation loyalty program by improving the effectiveness from the aspect of capitalizing on the lifetime value of the members, and to the industry in designing proper marketing strategy and implementing accurate marketing functions in term of Frequent Flyer Program.","[{""country"":[""Indonesia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Private Sector Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Odortypic maps have likewise been confirmed in specific second and third order brain centers in these taxa. However, there are two abiding problems that confront researchers studying olfactory processing and odor representation. The first pertains to marine crustaceans, in which any olfactory receptor neuron responds to a broad range of stimulants and supplies an olfactory lobe that is very differently organized from those of the sister group Insecta. The second relates, generally, to the question of how an odor source is located by an animal in its odor space: which circuits enable the coding of “where” as distinct from “what.” Research on insects, suggests that two additional modalities are required to determine an odor source. Yet in insects, as in crustaceans, there are blind taxa living in still environments that efficiently locate odor cues. Comparative anatomical studies on arachnids and flightless insects also suggest that invoking casting behaviors within upstream wind currents may not be sufficient to account for odor source detection. To fully appreciate the challenge offered by odorlocating systems we need to turn to visual processing where recent research has demonstrated that high order visual primitives are encoded in specific glomerular islets that together comprise the optic glomerular complex (OpGC). As in the antennal lobes of an insect, glomeruli of the OpGC are interconnected by elaborate arrangements of local interneurons. The outputs from the OpGC variously extend to premotor descending pathways, to the mushroom bodies, and to central brain areas. Neurons in visual neuropils that supply optic glomeruli are retinotopically organized; yet, because the axons of any one type of these neurons converge at a particular glomerulus, information about where the stimulus occurred in visual space is not represented. The OpGC therefore shares with antennal lobe’s olfactory glomerular complex a representation of stimulus properties but not a representation of where those properties occur in sensory space. The visual system does, however, contain a simple parallel system of neurons distinct from the OpGC that encodes “where,” not of any particular feature but of a salient feature. In my overview talk I will compare organization of olfactory representation across Arthopoda emphasizing similarities with the visual system, and consider how sensory representations may have evolved from a common ground pattern. I will ask whether a search image for a substrate, in which there is odortopic representation – as opposed to odortypic representation – might develop from the study of how other modalities are encoded in glomerular centers.

Although a vague concept which is difficult to define, public interest has been easily identifiable in Turkish administrative law doctrine. The question here is whether the Turkish state apparatus has turned into just another individual who seeks to maximize its interest by making the most rational choice rather than seeking to realize public interest.

Many of these studies have posited a causal link from perceptions of disorder to subsequent fear, with disorderly cues in the environment signalling to individuals that an area is in decline and unable to control deviant behaviour. But a growing body of evidence approaches this question from the opposite direction, emphasizing the socially constructed nature of perceived disorder and the potential role that fear may have in giving meaning to ambiguous disorderly cues present in the environment. This conceptual uncertainty stems, in part, from the reliance of existing research on cross-sectional data, making it impossible to say whether it is perceptions of disorder that shape fear or whether fear drives perceived disorder. A cross-lagged panel design is applied to longitudinal data from the Offending Crime and Justice Survey to more carefully explore the causal links between fear and disorder.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This research uses a longitudinal research design and interview data to determine if there are differences by year in the experiences of a cohort pre-tenure faculty in engineering at a research-intensive university. Two major shifts in priorities occurred within the three years: a shift from an emphasis on securing external funding to managing a research team and multiple sources of funding; and secondly, a shift from concern about the ambiguity of tenure expectations to growing confidence about expectations attributed largely to clear feedback about performance. Research findings presented here suggest that new faculty will benefit from professional development opportunities that address such issues as conflict, interpersonal communication, and essentials of supervision in a team and laboratory setting.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

I postulate that the new members cannot expect the same increased FDI flows that resulted to earlier EU entrants. Both groups of countries cannot base their industrial development strategy on passive reliance on such flows. Reliance on low costs and other ''generic'' advantages such as basic infrastructure is myopic in a globalised world. Benefiting from FDI requires a comprehensive strategy to build up domestic absorptive capacity and upgrading of the quality of their location advantages, since they are faced with increased competition for FDI not just from other European countries but also from other parts of the world, most notably Asia.","[{""country"":[""Euro area"",""Montenegro""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The analysis shows how the trading strategy of informed investors and the price impact of their trades depends on market conditions. The main prediction of the model is that institutional buyers are, on average, more aggressive than institutional sellers in bearish markets and less aggressive in bullish markets. Hence, the price impact is higher for purchases when market conditions are bearish, while it is higher for sales when market conditions are bullish. However, this asymmetry vanishes during strongly bearish or bullish phases, when information-based orders stop because the informational advantage of institutional investors becomes too small with respect to the transaction costs","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The regression models confirm that the major predictive factor of satisfactory functional capacity is the practice of physical activities, while for satisfaction, the major predictive factors are self-efficacy, good quality of social relations, and the performance of significant activities such as reading and going outside the home. Educational level is a variable that cuts across all these predictors, in a context of great unequal social opportunities in Latin America. These results have implications for the development and implementation of social policies and programs to achieve an improvement in living conditions of the growing elderly population in the region, and reduce costs that societies face as a product of this new demographic scenario.","[{""country"":[""Chile""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This article explores the Active, Beautiful, Clean (ABC) Waters Program as a socio-ecological practice that builds BGI for the high-density city-state of Singapore. Launched in 2006, the ABC Waters Program aims to simultaneously improve the recreational value, physical appearance, and water quality of all waters in Singapore through 2030. Driven by the quest for water security and the pursuit of a higher quality of life, the program involves sustainable stormwater management and waterway enhancement to enrich the functions of the existing aquatic and terrestrial green spaces. The ABC Waters Program provides valuable lessons for other high-density cities to overcome land scarcity as a constraint on BGI. With a shortage of green spaces, high-density cities should strive to optimize the existing green spaces in the provision of ecosystem services and to leverage cultural ecosystem services to engage citizens and gain public support. The case study on the ABC Waters Program also reveals a research gap in the socio-ecological practice research on BGI planning and design. The fundamental question of what qualifies as BGI has yet to be answered, and it is rarely discussed to what degree urban waterways can be considered BGI.","[{""country"":[""Singapore""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data"",""Laboratory Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The characteristics of welfare systems and welfare policies and the role of the welfare state in economic development are among the issues of most concern. The literature has categorised welfare states into three models - liberal, conservative, and social democratic regimes - following Gosta Esping-Andersen’s concept (Esping-Andersen, 1990). Recently, research works on East Asian social welfare have however, considered East Asia as a particular regime differing from the three above models, which Holliday (2000) named as a “productivist” regime. Being an East Asian country, over the past few decades, Korean social welfare has had a number of “productivist” characteristics. However, after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, Korea experienced a significant reform in its welfare system (Kim, 2006). What are the factors that forced the Korean welfare system to reform? What are the distinguishing characteristics of the Korean welfare system? What are the challenges facing Korea regarding the improvement of the welfare system in order to fit in with the new development context? These are the questions that this paper would like to explore and to develop some possible answers.

In order to evaluate alternative policies, we therefore need to make some assumptions about individual preferences, even before social welfare functions are applied. Instead of making a priori assumptions about those preferences that are likely to be wrong, there are two broad ways in which experimental methods are used to evaluate policy. One is to use experiments to estimate individual preferences, valuations and beliefs, and use those estimates as priors in the evaluation of policy. The other approach is to undertake deliberate randomization, or exploit accidental or natural randomization, to infer the effects of policy. The strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are reviewed, and their complementarities identified.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Preliminary evidence supports the role of psychosocial factors such as perceived social support (PSS) and campus connectedness (CC) as protective factors in the development of mental health problems in university students. However, research conducted on the potential ameliorating effects of social support on stress applying Cohen and Wills’ (1985) stress-buffering hypothesis produced weak, inconsistent, and even contradictory results. In addition, little attention has been given to examining the protective role of CC in the relationships between perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. The cur- rent study examined the applicability of CC and PSS in buffering the relationships been perceived stress, anxiety, and depression across an international sample comprised of university students (N = 206) from Australia, Hong Kong, and the United States. The prediction that CC and PSS would moderate the relationships between perceived stress, anxiety, and depression was partially sup- ported. The results indicated CC moderated the relationship between perceived stress and depression but did not moderate the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety. PSS did not moderate the relationship between perceived stress and depression or the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety, thus rejecting the stress-buffering hypothesis. These findings sug- gest less emphasis should be placed on PSS as a protective factor, with universities focusing on enhancing CC to reduce the high prevalence of mental health problems to promote psychological wellbeing among students.","[{""country"":[""Australia"",""Hong Kong SAR, China"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The interventions of Russia in the Middle East started since 2011 where they played their role to secure the regions' interest against the West. However, this influenced deeply the economic and political situation in the Arab world, due to various circumstances. The purpose of the paper is to develop comprehensive understanding towards the rising influence of the Russia and its intervention in the Middle East, based on gaining the political and economic dimensions towards it. The aim of the study is to conduct the critical analysis on the issue by means of gathering secondary data from past studies. The findings of the paper helped in revealing that the fall of the Soviet Union changed the dynamics of the region where much of the political and economic changes have been witnessed due to series of tensions and conflicts. However, since 2011, Russia tried to portray its positive involvement in harmonizing the Middle Eastern conflicts, but the Western conflicts with the communists affected the political scenario of the entire region. The implications involve much emphasis towards playing an influential role in reducing the situation of conflict and war in Syria, Palestine, Yemen and its adjoining areas.

This chapter, being set against a policy context, focuses on another process of marketization which is taking place within the newly emerging market economy. Specifically, this chapter tries to examine how the publicly-funded educational institutions in Guangdong province have been affected by strong market forces, like the free labour market and the resurgence of private education. Under such an impact, these institutions have adopted different strategies such as fee-charging principles, venturing into the commercial field to generate additional incomes, as well as providing “market-driven” courses. All these are done in order to cope with the pressing educational needs in the changing market economy and to make their educational services become more attractive and competitive.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In the past, financial instruments have been developed to hedge price risk on capital markets; however, in more recent times new financial instruments, weather derivatives, have been developing that hedge the volumetric risk associated with unfavourable weather. Weather derivatives have the ability to effectively hedge weather related volume risk for the agricultural, mining, energy and manufacturing industries, while also providing a risk management tool for construction firms and special events organisers, although there are still many hurdles to implementing agricultural weather derivative contracts in Australia. The optimal hedging ratio is found to be quite sensitive to the degree of risk aversion of the farmer and to the cost of obtaining the contracts.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Travelers are increasingly using ORs to inform them about accommodations and other tourism-related products. As such, it is important to improve our understanding of the behavioral consequences of e-word-of-mouth. In this article, we adopt the elaboration likelihood model to identify what influences travelers to adopt information from ORs in their decision making. We measure the influence of six dimensions of information quality that are part of the central route and two dimensions that are associated with the peripheral route of persuasion. The results of this study reveal that product ranking, information accuracy, information value-added, information relevance, and information timeliness are strong predictors of travelers’ adoption of information from ORs on accommodations. These results imply that high-involvement travelers adopt both central (information quality) and peripheral (product ranking) ro...","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The purpose of this is to replicate the consumer-based equity scale developed by Vazquez, Rio and Iglesias (2002) and to determine whether the scale could be applied to a different cultural setting. To achieve this, our research will: (1) replicate the four main dimension of Vazquez et. al. scale (i.e. product, functional utility, product symbolic utility, brand name functional utility, brand name symbolic utility); (2)identify the similarities and differences of the application of this scale in Turkey (a culture which is significantly different from that for which the scale was initially developed). Confirmatory factor analysis was used and the key findings from the study indicated that, although the scale fits the Turkish culture, it needed small changes.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this note, we estimate the effects through a simple econometric exercise using a vector error-correction model (VECM). Both a descriptive analysis of the raw data and an event-study analysis based on the output from the VECM suggest that while the tightening of the mortgage rules contributed to slower growth of both credit and residential investment, the effects were not always immediate. In some episodes, a tightening was followed by a temporary increase in residential mortgage credit growth (a finding that persists even after controlling for other events in the economy), possibly in anticipation of additional tightenings. In the long run, however, the residential mortgage growth rate was reduced. The consequences of rule changes were more persistent for residential mortgage growth than for the more volatile residential investment growth.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Minority communities are classified into three types: (1) with regular bilingual education, (2) with occasional bilingual education, and (3) without bilingual education. Educational levels within Type 1 and Type 2 communities correlate positively with their literacy rates: communities with higher literacy rates tend to have higher educational levels or vice versa. In Type 3 communities, regardless of literacy rates, communities with higher Chinese proficiency have done well in education, but those with lower Chinese proficiency have not. Primary, secondary and college education in all three types of communities has been affected by the three stages in the politics of bilingual education, though in different ways and to different degrees. This study suggests that regular bilingual education is essential for all three types of communities, regardless of their history of employing written native languages in education, to make progress beyond primary education.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Exploiting the arbitrary firm size threshold using regression discontinuity design, estimates show on average 2 percentage points higher employment growth for firms that became eligible for the scheme. However, tests and complementary regressions suggest that the higher employment growth for smaller firms in 2013 is driven by a 2010 reform, which imposes more stringent reporting requirements on larger firms. Accounting for this using difference-in-discontinuity regressions, we fail to find any significant effect of the subsidy on increasing employment of eligible firms. While our study suggests several pitfalls arising from size-contingent regulations, more data are needed to test for benecial long-term effects from the hiring subsidy in addressing duality of the Spanish labour market.

For five years the government has followed its own budget targets without regard to military requirements. The military command has made unauthorized expenditures without regard to the financial capabilities of a state experiencing a deep economic decline. The president and the parliament play the role of referees whose interference as yet has not improved the picture of financial clashes between civil and military interests. At the same time national security is becoming a main source of public concern and the necessity of the military reform is clear to the country's leadership. Only 5-10 years ago the public demanded both disclosure of military expenditures and spending reductions several times. Today according to some polls, about 51% of Russians would object to increases in military expenditures, which the government constantly tries to keep at the level of 3.5% of GDP (but which in reality are 79% of GDP taking into account the debts of the Russian DOD and total defense-related expenditures).","[{""country"":[""Russian Federation""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The author claims that therapist's feelings and experiences determine the diagnosis of the personality. It is neither the behavior nor the psychopathological phenomena, which have a diagnostic value, but how the relationship is experienced in terms of the therapist's feelings. The author speaks about the problems connected to of “as if” personalities as a starting point. This concept originated with the psychopathological studies of Helene Deutsch, who associated it with schizophrenia. Later, Paul Roazen transported the concept to the social dimension of politics and to the personality of politicians. In this article, the author treats the “as if” personalities as a concept of unification, in contrast to current attempts to fragment diagnostic personality disorders, as in many psychoanalytic concepts in relation to the medicalization of psychoanalysis. Some clinical vignettes are briefly presented in order to sharpen this focus.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This takes the protagonist from the infamous neighborhood of his birth in San Francisco, “a valley of desperation in a city of towering wealth,” to his trials and tribulations in the war-torn homeland of Yemen. I will argue that the narrative, which blurs the lines between fiction and nonfiction and combines history, politics, biography and thriller, highlights the American entrepreneurial zeal and contagious exuberance which still feed the immigrant American Dream and proves that social mobility in the United States is still attainable, sometimes as a result of chasing the world’s most dangerous cup of coffee. Moreover, I argue that the protagonist’s endeavor can be read within the larger context of contemporary political consumption as an example of social justice activism and ethics-driven buying.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Within these regions, the high prevalence and regional variation in HIV rates help to explain the decline in remarriage. Widows who reject wife inheritance are more likely to enroll their children in school, while child school enrollment outside these regions does not vary by a widow’s remarriage decision. In this paper, I attempt to explain what makes a widow less likely to remarry and why within - but not outside of - wife inheritance regions her children are more likely to be enrolled in school. The conceptual model can qualitatively explain that a widow enters the marriage option with the combination that gives her a better chance of enrolling her child in school and that an unanticipated shock aects the attractiveness of schooling once she makes her remarriage decision. I present descriptive regressions motivated by the conceptual model.","[{""country"":[""Sub-Saharan Africa""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

With this in mind, I will first give a broad overview of why affirmative action was necessary in South Africa as a tool for social change. Secondly, I will sketch the landscape of South Africa’s jurisprudence on affirmative action, touching on relevant legislation, though limiting the discussion to whether affirmative action is a right in the hands of the scorned employee or a defence to be raised by the employer against that employee, with reference to case law. Lastly, I will attempt to show how the labour courts have all answered this question unanimously in recent cases, in response to the decisions of Harmse v City of Cape Town ((2003) 24 ILJ 1130 (LC)) and Dudley v City of Cape Town & Others ((2004) 25 ILJ 305 (LC)).","[{""country"":[""South Africa""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The private sector, which to date controls most releases of tGMOs globally, has combined philanthropy and commercialisation to this end. Yet few benefits have materialised. This narrative paper surveys and provides a framework for how multinational companies transfer tGMOs. It analyses the companies' limitations, including internal incentives, indemnity and intellectual property rights.

The project employs the concept of the family language policy and examines what the families’ language policies are, what factors contribute to their policies, and how and why they adhere to or change the policies. Families do not usually state their language policies explicitly, but whether intentionally or unintentionally, people make decisions on their language use in each speech community and those decisions become the community’s language policies. Spolsky (2007) says that there are three components in language policy whether it is national policy or family policy: practices, beliefs, and management. Our study focuses on the sphere of the family and attempts an ethnographic investigation into the language use in the domestic relationships through exploring the three domains Spolsky identifies.

The data was collected from the Banking sector of Pakistan. The questionnaires were used to collect the data. Convenience sampling was used in this study. The sample size of the study was 400 but we had received only 250. After applying regression and correlation we found that internal marketing have positive relationship with job satisfaction and employee engagement also have positive relationship as mediator. I. Introduction In the present era, services have become key to success in the fiscal progressions of countries worldwide. During the decade of 1980""s, many nations had faced abolishment of services specially in banking, insurance, telecommunication, transport and healthcare, which in return ultimately gave rise to a firm competition among various business. At that time many organizations felt the need to diversify and devise different marketing strategies for the satisfaction of customers. Thus in such a varying situation, survival of the fittest was pushed to be the key to sustainability. Internal marketing was first proposed as a solution to the problem of delivering high quality service. According to this concept, the human resource of an organization which affects the quality of customer service being delivered. Internal marketing is part of the marketing strategy with the employee""s themselves act as internal customers. It is used as a philosophy for managing human resource of the firm by satisfying their necessities so that they work with utmost dedication and devotion and pave way for the company""s success. The fifth ""P"" in services marketing mix is People who are a vital constituent to any service provision. If an organization wants to obtain a form of competitive advantage, it needs to recruit the right staff and train them effectively in their service delivery. Recently more emphasis is lied on providing good services to the employees of the organization than its customers. Employee Engagement is the level of commitment of employee on both emotional and intellectual grounds fulfilling all the requirements of work place making sure mission and vision of the company are met at all times. It can also be defined as owing the company in such a manner that it will benefit both the external and internal leading to success of the company. The concept was derived by Schmidt et al. (1993), describing it as modern version of job satisfaction. They defined it as ""an employee's involvement with, commitment to, and satisfaction with work. Employee engagement is a part of employee retention."" It further integrated the concept of job satisfaction with the organizational commitment (Smith et al., 1969) (Meyer & Allen, 1991). The banking industry is going through drastic revolution worldwide mainly due to the relaxation in economic restrictions, private sector ownerships and growth on worldwide scale. The Pakistani banking industry is part of all this. Banks area pivotal to the fiscal development of present countries. Conventionally, in Pakistan private participation is limited for banks as compared to banks in public sector. During the decade of 1990, circumstances got changed in the banking sector industry. Technological advancements had an incredible impact on the operations of commercial banks in the public sector of Pakistan by pioneering the concept of Mobile banking services in order to fulfill the emerging needs and facilitate clients. Like other economical service industries, the banking industry is facing some unique challenges including unpredictable market, innovations, financial volatility, furious rivalry and needs and desires of consumers. Banking is included in service industry thus its distinguishing factors are its customers and how they are being served. Employees dealing directly with customers should be acquainted with the basic know how of handling and satisfying their customers.","[{""country"":[""Pakistan""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

And not all virtual dating remains virtual as some couples who meet virtually marry irl. Virtual dating offers a host of perks that dating in real life cannot, such as: sexual encounters without fear of disease or pregnancy, anonymity, and, for some, a chance to ""cheat"" on a partner without ever leaving home. This paper will explore the ethical and prudential aspects of virtual dating, focusing on moral issues like lying and on prudential issues like satisfying urges for different partners within a committed relationship without ever touching another person. Introduction Gem and Zupy were married earlier this year in a beautiful ceremony atop a snow-covered mountain with a breathtaking view. They met last year and dated for seven months before officially taking the plunge. Theirs is a fairly common story, except the couple has never been in the same city together or even in the same state. And Gem and Zupy are both married to other people irl (in real life). Their wedding ceremony, and their entire relationship, is virtual, having taken place in the virtual world of Second Life. How does virtual dating compare to traditional face-to-face dating? Since they are both legally married to other people, does Gem and Zupy's virtual relationship and marriage count as cheating or even as polygamy? Continually improving technology has made virtual dating more attractive than in the past. The advent of social virtual worlds like Second Life, and the popularity of other kinds of virtual worlds such as MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) like the immensely popular World of Warcraft, have made purely virtual relationships and dating more appealing then in the past when the available options were online chat rooms and dating websites. And not all virtual dating remains purely virtual as some online relationships later turn into ""real-world"" relationships. Virtual dating offers a host of perks that dating in real life cannot, such as: sexual encounters without fear of disease or pregnancy, anonymity, and, for some, a chance to ""cheat"" on a partner without ever leaving home. This paper will explore the ethical and prudential aspects of virtual dating, focusing on moral issues like lying and on prudential issues like satisfying urges for different partners within a committed relationship without ever touching another person. Dating, Cybersex, and Virtual Worlds Virtual dating, online relationships, and online sexual encounters (which I will group under the category cybersex) can take place in a number of ways and in a number of virtual venues, but perhaps the easiest places for such encounters to take place in are virtual worlds. Virtual dating, online relationships and cybersex are in no way restricted to virtual worlds, however virtual worlds like the popular Second Life and World of Warcraft offer subscribers far more visual stimulation, as well as more potential partners, than most other online venues. Having spent over four years playing World of Warcraft and a few months wandering around some very interesting places in Second Life, I can say that both worlds are far more ""social"" than one might suspect. While online dating experiences and cybersex encounters surely can vary greatly, a look at these two most popular virtual worlds can offer some insight into purely virtual relationships. For those who have never encountered a virtual or online world, the idea of dating in one may be strange indeed. But virtual worlds have amassed a huge number of subscribers and their popularity only continues to grow. Linden Lab's Second Life (SL, for short) and Blizzard's World of Warcraft (commonly known as WoW) each claim to have more than 12 million subscribers worldwide, and WoW has servers in many different countries. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Optimization of an athlete’s level of motivation through the operationalization of the psychological training aims at maximizing the level of performance achieved by the athlete. The research was carried out using specific techniques, based on quantifying motivational levels in order to identify global motivational force (GMF), determining the general motivation instrumentality (GMI) and the motivation instrumentality (MI) by motivational factors, which reflect the independent variables of motivation, these generating objectives in the optimization of psychological training. Quantifying the motivational level of an athlete revealed to us the sensitive differences between the values of the athlete (7.35) and those of his coach (6.85), in his perception of the athlete’s motivational structures. Based on the values identified regarding the general motivation instrumentality (GMI) for the athlete O.M. and taking into consideration the evaluation of the athlete by his coach and the ranking of each motivational factor, we were able to create objectives for psychological training. The results recorded throughout the research show an ascending curve in the GMF values of the athlete, from 7.35 to 8.57, values which signify a motivational profile with increased tendencies towards a higher level. Applying this strategy with regards to optimizing the motivational level of the athlete (O.M.) through operationalizing his psychological training leads to an improvement in both GMI and GMF values. © 2016 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.uk","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Schelling. If the concept is accurate, it can improve how we conduct such interventions. ********** Popular accounts of civil wars and insurgencies are filled with references to ""windows of opportunity"" and ""tipping points""--moments in time when the dynamics of a conflict are supposedly shifting in ways that may portend a decisive change in a war's trajectory. These concepts have been used in mainstream media accounts, professional journals, and special reports to explain recent events in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Syria, and elsewhere. If windows of opportunity and tipping points accurately describe critical junctures in conflicts and can be identified either ahead of time or as they occur (rather than solely through the benefit of hindsight), the policy implications are substantial. After the painful experiences of Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States is committed to avoiding large-scale entanglements in other nations' internal conflicts, seeking instead to ""develop innovative, low-cost, and small-footprint approaches to achieve our security objectives."" (1) Unfortunately, US military doctrine and numerous other sources make clear that decisive intervention in civil wars and insurgencies typically is a manpower-intensive and costly endeavor. (2) If there are particular moments in time when a conflict is at a critical turning point, it may be possible for small-scale interjections of external forces to have disproportionately large effects. Conversely, if there are only short-lived opportunities in which the course of a conflict might be turned without a massive commitment of resources, then that knowledge might help the United States better identify when it should avoid intervention. Despite the widespread appeal of concepts like windows of opportunity and tipping points to explain the trajectories of civil wars around the globe, there have been few attempts to apply them in a systematic way and even fewer efforts to explain their implications for foreign military intervention. (3) As they are typically used, the terms do not distinguish between simple changes in a conflict's trajectory--potentially fleeting and insignificant--and more meaningful junctures. This article explores the concept of a tipping point and its implications for America's reliance on low-cost, small-footprint approaches to stabilizing embattled partner governments. More specifically, the article asks two questions: Are there identifiable opportunities in the course of an insurgency in which even relatively small actions could help tilt the conflict decisively in favor of the government? And if so, how can the United States best take advantage of these opportunities? (4) Tipping Points The concept of tipping was first formalized by the Nobel Prizewinning economist Thomas Schelling. (5) Tipping points are a subset of ""critical mass"" or ""threshold"" dynamics in which the behavior of a certain proportion of the population--a proportion that is different in every circumstance--causes others to behave in a similar manner, leading to cascading effects. Tipping point dynamics typically occur as an iterated process. In the first step, a ""critical mass"" or ""threshold"" number of people makes a particular decision--for instance, to participate in a protest against a regime. Their behavior, in turn, provides information that causes other people to act in a similar fashion. After witnesses of an anti-regime demonstration observe that the regime did not engage in violent repression, they may become emboldened to participate themselves. (6) As more and more people make the same decision, pressures continue to mount on those who had initially opposed such behavior. Loyalists, for instance, might have preferred that a regime stay in place, but once most of their neighbors change loyalties, they may feel uncomfortable, or even unsafe, engaging in public support of the regime. …","[{""country"":[""Indonesia"",""Iraq"",""Libya"",""Mali"",""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Per Spanish law, minors internationally adopted by a Spanish parent are “Spanish by origin” (espanoles de origen). Over and above this, however, Spain’s Civil Registry Law was modified in 2005 to allow internationally adoptive parents to officially change their child’s place of birth in the formal record. I draw on legal material about this change, as well as online posts by adoptive parents discussing it, to make two claims. First, I identify the significance of place as a key resource for the production of kinship—belonging to a Spanish family and nation. Second, I note the persistence of an ideology of secrecy or privacy surrounding the family that is linked to a history of illicit child circulations during the Franco era. I further show that documents are a key nexus mediating the place–kinship and privacy–kinship relations, requiring further attention to both legal documentation and the proliferation of public personal narratives, such as blog posts, as evidence of family dynamics.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Drawing on allostatic load as a long-term biological consequence of physiological wear-and-tear and an indicator of stress response, we use three different studies to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between self-employment and physiological outcomes. In Study 1, based on a sample of 194 self-employed and 1511 employed individuals, we find that self-employment is marginally related to allostatic load and allostatic load marginally mediates the relationship between self-employment and physical, but not mental, health. Study 2, based on a sample of 776 self-employed and 8003 employed individuals, extends these findings, and provides evidence that those who are self-employed for longer periods have a higher allostatic load. Finally, in Study 3 we draw on a sample of 174 twins and, consistent with Study 2, show that those reporting self-employment in two waves (about eight years apart) had a higher allostatic load, however, when leveraging problem-focused coping such individuals experienced lower allostatic load. Taken together, these three studies extend our understanding of the relationship between self-employment and wellbeing.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Despite its prominence, however, a number of fundamental questions remain regarding the structure and function of attitude strength. In this chapter we draw on a wide range of evidence to clarify the nature of attitude strength. Rather than conceiving of attitude strength as a meaningful psychological construct, we argue that it is better conceptualised as an umbrella term that refers in only the most general way to multiple, separable classes of attitude outcomes, instigated by different antecedents and produced by distinct psychological processes. Although strong attitudes share a set of general qualities—resistance to change, persistence over time, impact on thought and behaviour—there are many distinct routes by which attitudes come to possess these...","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Methods : ActivPal3â„¢ activity monitors were affixed to 25 Bryan Collegiate High School studentsâ€™ to monitor their standing time and activity levels. Data were collected at the beginning of the school year (fall) in traditional seated desks and in the spring in stand-biased desks. After attrition, 18 of the original 25 students were included in the final analysis. The physical activity data (steps) as well as standing and sitting time data provided by the monitors was used for within subject intervention analyses. Results : Descriptive statistics and a two-sided t-test were used to analyse differences between pre and post intervention sitting and standing times. Analysis indicated a significant reduction of sitting time post stand-biased desk intervention (p<0.0001) and a significant increase in standing time, post stand-biased desk intervention (p<0.0001). Analysis also revealed a non-statistically significant (p < 0.0619) average increase of 2,286 steps per school day when comparing mean steps pre-intervention (6,612) and post-intervention (8,898). Conclusions : Standing desks have the potential to reduce sedentary behavior and increase light to moderate physical activity for high school students during the school day.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Next, it uses public opinion and elite survey data to provide descriptive evidence about citizen perceptions of levels of corruption. Third, the paper uses media data to explore the place that corruption held in the public agenda during the last fifteen years. Finally, using court records, it evaluates the efficacy of existing structures to punish abuses.

What is the women's studies critic to do when a genre dominated by women writers and readers appears to conflict with feminist ideals? And what are teachers to do when that conflict turns up in the classroom: when students feel a disjunction between their pre-existing reading practices and the critical theories that inform their studies? The opposition between feminist theory and women's popular reading practices, in scholarship and in the classroom, is an especially pointed instance of an opposition often expressed in the scholarship of teaching literature more generally. This article examines the conflict between popular and critical literary reading practices. It then focuses specifically on romance by outlining feminist critical arguments both for and against romance reading. Finally, it recommends that we acknowledge these two areas of dissonance (the conflict students may feel as they straddle different reading practices, and the complicated relationship between feminism and the romance genre), and suggests strategies for making them an analytical focus in class.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The paper assesses how shipping lines have adapted their liner service schedules (in terms of commercial speed, number of vessels deployed per loop, etc.) to deal with increased bunker costs. The paper also includes a cost model to simulate the impact of bunker cost changes on the operational costs of liner services. The cost model demonstrates for a typical North Europe–East Asia loop that the current bunker prices have a significant impact on the costs per TEU even when using large post-panamax vessels. The model also shows shipping lines are reacting quite late to higher bunker costs. The reasons that explain the late adaptation of liner services relate to inertia, transit time concerns, increasing costs associated with fixing schedule integrity problems and fleet management issues.","[{""country"":[""East Asia & Pacific"",""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This stimulated some retail developers to prepare plans for mega shopping centres. As mega shopping centres do not exist in the Netherlands, this study aims at eliciting consumers’ preferences for this kind of new developments. Consumers visiting a down town shopping centre and one of the largest out-of-town shopping centres in the Netherlands were presented descriptions of different hypothetical mega shopping centres, systematically varying on 10 attributes. The consumers were asked to select the centre they preferred most from sets of two centres. The following attributes were used to define the mega shopping centres: accessibility by car, accessibility by public transport, parking tariff, length of the main shopping streets, type of shopping supply, type of anchor stores, type of traffic allowed in the shopping centre, design style, scale of the shopping streets, and type of activities in the shopping centre. Over 300 respondents completed the online questionnaire. Discrete choice models (both multinomial and mixed logit) were estimated to assess the importance of each attribute. Overall, the estimation results confirm expectations. Shoppers prefer well accessible shopping centres and free parking. The preferred time needed to walk through the main streets of the shopping centre is 45 minutes; 30 minutes is still acceptable, but 15 minutes is not preferred at all. Shoppers do not prefer a shopping supply existing of small and medium sized (local) shops, and specialised/exclusive shops are preferred over the well known national chains. Regarding anchor stores, shoppers seem to dislike the very large electronics stores and traditional department stores are preferred over flagship stores. Only pedestrians should be allowed to enter the shopping centre. Other traffic modes like bicycles and especially motorized modes are not preferred. The design style should be historically while a Disney style is detested. A modern design style is somewhere in between. The preferred scale of the shopping streets is a mixture of short/narrow and long/wide streets. Only long/wide scale shopping streets are not preferred. Finally, the type of activities offered by the shopping centre should be a mixture of passive and active activities. Shoppers seem to be less happy with active activities only. Although all attributes have a significant impact on the preference for a shopping centre, parking fee and design style appear to be the most important attributes. In addition to the overall effects, significant differences between females and males, between younger and older respondents, and between respondents recruited in the down town shopping centre and respondents recruited in the large out-of-town shopping centre were found. Some interactions between attributes were significant as well. The models perform very satisfactory.","[{""country"":[""Netherlands""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The population of this study is non-finance and banking companies listed at IDX. The sample of this research were 29 non-finance and banking companies listed in IDX during 2012-2016. This research used multiple linear regression and logistic regression method for testing the hypothesis. The results of this research showed that on the first model, sustainability report disclosure doesn't affect the corporate performance. The second model showed that public responsibility aspect of sustainability report disclosure, negative effects on financial distress. The last model showed that corporate performance doesn't affect the financial distress. Therefore, corporate performance can't be used as an intervening variable. The implications of this study theoretically can provide evidence of the theory being tested related to the effect of sustainability report disclosure on financial distress with company performance as an intervening variable. Practically, this research is expected to be able to give an overview of the importance of sustainability reports disclosure to be made and published periodically by the company because this is considered to improve the performance of the company which will minimize or prevent companies from financial distress. ::: Keywords: corporate performance, financial distress, product responsibility, sustainability report.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The study focuses on asking how the comprehensive schools cope with the reform in a time of economic instability and contradictory goals. The first phase of the research program took place during a continuing education program about inclusive education and school development. The participants comprised 530 in-service teachers and 14 school principals in fourteen primary and secondary schools. The two and half year long continuing education program offered spaces for reflections in the school community and in tailored seminars for the schools involved. The participants were engaged in discussions of gaining understanding of inclusive education and of how to respond to students´ diversity. In the study inclusion education is seen as a complex transitional process and a multifaceted question, which involves different levels from educational policy on a national level to the local school community level and the single teacher as an agency for change. According to the preliminary results the transformation process demands a cultural shift of the traditional teacher work culture; from tend to work alone to collaboration and cross sectional cooperation. The school leaders are in a key position in fostering requisites for a professional learning community with spaces for reflections, sharing experiences and knowledge in order to get enough unanimity in the school community for promoting inclusive learning settings. A single teacher´s attitude is affected by these collective meaning making processes. During the professional development program different kind of collaboration was encouraged and changes in a more collaborative direction could be recognized. In the article we discuss the results in terms of the raised contextual factors at different levels in the transformation processes.","[{""country"":[""Finland""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

These changes in user access behavior present a challenge of delivering content to a diversified consumer base. This article addresses this challenge by identifying the key factors for the design of content delivery systems (gross value of content, delivery delay, sensitivity to delivery delay, accessing cost, and processing cost) and explicitly modeling their interactions. We investigate two content delivery systems—push and pull systems, and solve for the content provider's optimal push frequency decision and consumers’ push versus pull decisions. We show that the content provider's selection of push frequency plays a critical role determining the segmentation of the consumer market into the push group and the pull group. Our findings suggest that firms should set a relatively high push frequency to cater to high-type consumers, which leads to two consumer groups with low-type consumers belonging to the pull group and high-type consumers belonging to the push group","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Respondents included a birth cohort from 1928 to 1937 with data collected in 1992 (N=941) and in 2002 (N=574) and a birth cohort from 1938 to 1947 with data collected in 2002 (N=884). We assessed cohort and time-sequential changes. Parents of the later cohort had more contact and support exchanges with their children than the earlier cohort, revealing that families have not declined in importance. Furthermore, longitudinally, contact and supportive exchanges with adult children decreased, suggesting that parents and children devote less time to intergenerational relationships during this “empty nest” phase.","[{""country"":[""Netherlands""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

While transfers of war crimes suspects to The Hague have dominated EU relations with the countries of the Western Balkans, domestic transitional justice mechanisms such as truth-telling inquiries and war crimes trials have been ignored by the international community. However, international justice remains both remote and heavily contested across the region, and is often used to radicalise nationalist sentiments instead of facilitating reconciliation among ethnic communities. The goals of EU conditionality in ex-Yugoslavia – promoting reconciliation and cross-border cooperation – can only be effectively advanced if mechanisms of transitional justice are employed at the national level, articulating truth and rebuilding the rule of law by establishing war crimes accountability from within.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

To assess this demand effect, a demand-truncated production function is developed and an “effectiveness” measure is proposed. Often a firm can adjust some input resources influencing the output level in an attempt to match demand. We propose a short-run capacity planning method, termed proactive data envelopment analysis, which quantifies the effectiveness of a firm’s production system under demand uncertainty. Using a stochastic programming DEA approach, we improve upon short-run capacity expansion planning models by accounting for the decreasing marginal benefit of inputs and estimating the expected value of effectiveness, given demand. The law of diminishing marginal returns is an important property of production function; however, constant marginal productivity is usually assumed for capacity expansion problems resulting in biased capacity estimates. Applying the proposed model in an empirical study of convenience stores in Japan demonstrates the actionable advice the model provides about the levels of variable inputs in uncertain demand environments. We conclude that the method is most suitable for characterizing production systems with perishable goods or service systems that cannot store inventories.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

KEYWORD: Staff training; staff or employees; CONSIBOTCOMPANY International Conference on Social Science, Education Management and Sports Education (SSEMSE 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 247 staff from the employee in terms of staff to the enterprise training enthusiasm is low, the training satisfaction is lower, the enterprise did not improve the training evaluation mechanism. 2.2 The problems existing in the staff training of CONSIBOT co., LTD Staff requirements analysis is divided into organizational analysis, task analysis and individual analysis of three levels, through the investigation, understand the company analyzed the organization and tasks, which solved the ""what is the focus of the training?"" What is the content of the training and ""?"" Two aspects of problems, but not for individual analysis, personnel analysis is to determine which staff need to accept the culture of the enterprise, and what kind of training need to be, that is, to solve ""who take part in training?"", through understanding, to participate in training is only part of the new employees, and to have a job for a period of time after the need to continue education of staff and senior managers, the company did not make analysis and training arrangement. 2.3 Rainfall distribution on the lack of a reasonable training plan 1). Training objects scope is small Understands through interviews of management personnel, the company training new employees is the main object, and long working hours and the professional knowledge have a deep need of employees and the company management personnel are not included in the scope of training. 2). the training schedule is not reasonable accounted for only 33% of employees feel company training time arrangement is reasonable, and 67% of people think that the training time arrangements and unreasonable. Through the interview with the manager and employee, training schedule problems include two aspects: (1). the whole training time is shorter. Training content arrangement is more, and each training time in just five days or so, in the end of the training, business leaders will address, probably take up 1/4 of the training time, cause the unnecessary waste of time. A few days time, employees cannot learn substantial content. (2). the specific time training arrangement is not reasonable. Training arrangement of time is on Saturday and Sunday, Monday to Friday to go to work in the company. Down during the period of training, the whole week, employees have almost no time to personal disposable, the serious influence to participate in training the enthusiasm. 3 PERFECT THE CONSIBOT CO., LTD., THE CONCRETE MEASURES OF STAFF TRAINING PROBLEM 3.1 To do a good job of training demand analysis First of all, managers should first change training idea, realized that not only is the staff need training, enterprise management knowledge and management skills of high and low, for the direction of the enterprise plays a more important role. So the training object should not be confined to the grassroots staff, senior members of the staff and enterprise need to continue education should accept more relevant training. 3.2 reasonable training plans Arrange training time Now the company training time in about five days, and will arrange the training content is more, should increase staff training time to arrange a more reasonable training plan, to 12 days, for example, the front to relate the theoretical knowledge, a few days later a few days can give employees in the factory process of actual operation, this can let employees accept specific procedures, upon completion of the training work at the same time, also improve the quality of the training better. Each training time is on Saturday, should give staff arrangement of spare time in the weekend, for their freedom. Can change the training to the time, that is, the date to the date, but not every time training is conducted at the weekend. Holdings to change the training site In noise larger factories, which seriously affects the quality of learning? If is the classroom type training company should arrange a relatively quiet and comfortable teaching environment, can be in outside rent a house or choose management as a training base in the home. 3.3 to organize and implement do systemic training He will strengthen training pertinence Don't post staff specific needs, training content can be according to the result of employee training demand analysis and trainers, jointly by the company employees to make recommendations on the content of the training can be at the same time, in the direction of the company to grasp the teaching better meet the demand of staff training at the same time, enhance the pertinence of the training content, improve the quality of staff training. 3.4 Adopt various training methods, strengthen the training of flexibility CONSIBOT company adopts force-feeding teaching, this way of training is hard to adapt to the","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The statutory and functional powers of the institution are wide and the ombudsman enjoys a priori sympathy from Parliament and the media. In addition, there are no specialised administrative courts in Denmark and the ombudsman is thus unrivalled on the legal scene as the primary specialist protector of good administration. Nevertheless, the Danish ombudsman subscribes to a narrow scope of focus in the protection of citizens’ rights. In practice, the ombudsman often limits his review to the authorities’ compliance with national law and in particular with general procedural requirements. The rights of citizens are only actively protected by the ombudsman as far as certain parts of general administrative law are concerned. The limited horizon in the control and thinking of the Danish ombudsman leaves the European Union rights of citizens largely unidentified and unprotected. The Danish ombudsman is a watchdog with teeth but with discerning taste buds. As to EU Law, the ombudsman is a watchdog with no appetite at all.","[{""country"":[""Denmark""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Specifically drawing on themes contained within the sociology of knowledge and Marxist conflict theory, it is argued that the inclusion of experiential persons and collectivities is necessary to produce socially and culturally grounded knowledge regarding the meaning and consequences of illicit substance use. We argue that knowledge flowing from the everyday existence and experiences of drug users forms the basis of effective policy and programming. Experiential knowledge challenges “expert” groups such as policy makers and academic researchers to be reflexive about their position vis-a-vis those they study and to develop effective alliances with user groups. In addition to informing research, policy and programming, user group organizations play a key role in challenging dominant rhetoric regarding illicit drug use as a social problem and demonstrate that the most marginalized members of society can effectively mobilize in the interest of emancipatory social change. Despite the important benefits associated with the inclusion of experiential persons and user groups in research and various levels of social policy and programming, many structural and cultural barriers to meaningful inclusion of user groups exist; it is important to identify these barriers so that they can be strategically engaged and overcome. Two Canadian examples of user group organizations are discussed in order to illustrate both the positive influence and common challenges associated with including experiential knowledge and user group organizations in policy and program development.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The null hypothesis of no threshold eff ect is rejected at the 5 percent signi cance level for most cases. While we fi nd no evidence of a threshold around 90 percent, our fi ndings suggest that the debt threshold for economic growth may exist around a relatively small debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent.

Behaviours that signify resistance to the rules according to which benefits are allocated prompt us to consider causal links and feedbacks between benefits, perceptions of benefits, meanings attached to the benefits, and the regulatory instruments that mediate the distribution of benefits. An understanding of how meanings influence the perception of benefits exposes the complexity inherent in how people perceive and allocate value to natural resource benefits. Meanings are personal, sometimes overlapping, context dependent and variable across space and time. A challenge in directing resource user behaviour in common pool resources is that the relationship between the resource and resource use is typically not interpreted to include the manner in which users associate resource benefits with meanings. We propose that collective ordering of meanings and associated rules help to direct behaviours and in doing so they contribute to the purposeful maintenance of desirable elements of a social-ecological system (i.e. robustness). Using an example, we illustrate how tensions around benefit sharing are rooted in the emergence and changing prioritisation of contexts and meanings over time. The importance of eliciting, ordering and sanctioning of meanings is emphasised. We conclude by discussing the implications for robustness and benefit sharing in social-ecological systems and we comment on the usefulness and limitations of the framework.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The British possessions in the region were at stake in the aftermath of the First World War. Since the early 1930s the Foreign Office had been eagerly planning the establishment of a university in the region in order to make the local elites familiar with Western culture. Egypt, Palestine, and Cyprus were considered the most likely locations for the institution. It is argued that cultural propaganda was perceived by the Foreign Office as an essential component of the empire’s strategy and legitimacy in its sphere of influence. Although the project was eventually not realized due to the outbreak of the Second World War, its significance lies in the demonstration of the British grand strategy in the eastern Mediterranean during the interwar period.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

By providing empirical evidence, it intends to show that the upgraded quality of institutional development is significantly and positively related to FDI into the SEE countries. The paper measures institutional development based on a series of indicators of the progress of the transition process constructed by European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Using panel dataset for the period 1999 to 2006 we constructed an econometric model that was used to estimate the determinants of FDI on sectoral level. Econometric analysis used OLS with panelcorrected standard errors (PCSEs). Our analysis indicates that general measure of institutional development is statistically significant and confirms that the overall quality of the institutions attracts FDI in manufacturing sector in SEE region. The descriptive analysis reveals that most SEE countries managed to attain standards and performances typical of advanced industrial economies only in the areas of Price liberalization and Trade & Forex system, while in all the other observed areas of institutional progress (Large scale privatisation, Small scale privatisation, Enterprise restructuring, Competition policy, Banking reform & interest rate liberalisation, Securities markets & non-bank financial institutions, Overall infrastructure reform and Telecommunications) SEE countries are at different stages of designing, adopting and implementing their institutional reforms. Thus, it can be deduced that the quality of institutional development is still poor, and that significant efforts need to be made to facilitate institutional development in order to attract foreign investors.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A mixed method evaluation design has been adopted in the study.,The findings revealed that effort expectancy was negatively associated with behaviour intention and push factor and positively associated with pull factor. Performance expectancy was positively associated with balance factor, push factor and behaviour intention. Hedonic motivation was positively associated with behaviour intention and emotional factor. Behaviour intention was negatively associated with use behaviour. Facilitating conditions was positively associated with push factor. Habit was positively associated with behaviour intention and negatively associated with pull, push, balance and emotional factors. Necessities and habit were not motivation factors for women entrepreneurs.,The sample was restricted to women entrepreneurs, limiting the generalizability of the findings.,The practical implications of the study show that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions and habit are the key factors for the women’s entrepreneurship motivation. Women’s entrepreneurship commissions to be established in chambers of commerce and industry can improve entrepreneurial motivation.,This is the first study that reveals the effects of technology acceptance and use behaviours on women’s entrepreneurship motivation.

These industries rely on low-cost labor, often supplied by migrants, typically acquired through labor brokers. Very little attention has so far been paid to trafficking of men into extractive industries or its connection with trafficked women in the region's mining hubs. Recent reports suggest that labor-brokering practices foster human trafficking, both by exposing migrant men to lack of pay and exploitative conditions and by creating male migratory patterns that generate demand for sex workers and associated trafficking of women and girls. While trafficking in persons violates human rights, and thus remains a priority issue globally, there is little or no evidence of an effective political response to mine-related trafficking in southern Africa. This article concludes with recommendations for legal and policy interventions, as well as an enhanced public health response, which if implemented would help reduce human trafficking toward mining sites.

The use of these criteria willoften result in a short list of environmentalattributes of which some are causally related. The inclusion of attributes that have a``cause-effect'' relationship may stimulate somerespondents to seek to understand the causalrelations among attributes in order to assigngreater meaning to the alternatives, andpotentially, simplify the decision makingprocess. This may have implications for theweights they assign to each of the attributeswhen identifying the preferred alternatives,and subsequently for the implicit prices and/orwelfare estimates. A test of the impact ofincluding an attribute that causesimpacts on ecosystem health as well as anattribute relating to ecosystem health effectson parameter estimates, implicitprices and welfare estimates is conducted. Twoquestionnaires are developed, one with the`causal' attribute included and one without. Acomparison of results indicates that when the`causal' attribute is included in the vector ofchoice attributes, the implicit value of asingle endangered species falls by 34 per centwhilst no significant difference is detected inthe parameter estimates. Importantly, however,estimates of compensating surplus for a givenpolicy package do not differsignificantly across the two treatments. Thisimplies that to the extent that the inclusionof a `causal' attribute reduces the implicitprices for one or more of the `effect'attributes, the associated loss in utility isapproximately offset by the utility nowassociated with the new attribute.

The conference proceedings were published under the title Technology and Language Testing (Stansfield, 1986). The proceedings indicate that several papers presented at the conference dealt with CBT and the application of latent trait models to item-bank construction, item selection, and computer adaptive testing (CAT). The general measurement profession had been working with CBT and, more specifically, with CAT since the early 70s. The first conference on CAT was held in 1975. Perhaps the main reason the L2 field has lagged behind in this area is because it has long promoted performance-based assessment, a form of assessment that does not lend itself as readily to computerized administration as do more traditional test formats. In fact, the second section of the Stansfield volume deals primarily with performance-based assessment. So, whereas general measurement researchers, especially those working with CAT, have concerned themselves more with selected-response item types, the L2 field has continued to promote performance-based assessment. Even today, CBT performancebased assessment continues to be a challenge. After Stansfield (1986), the most significant work on language testing and technology is an edited volume by Dunkel (1991). Dunkel's volume is devoted to computer-assisted language learning and CAT. The CAT section documents how knowledge in the L2 field has progressed in the area of CBT. For the most part, the studies continue to explore the value of the adaptive format and report on various CAT developments and validation research efforts. What is most significant about this volume, however, is the variety of CAT applications for assessing L2 proficiency in school and university settings, a clear indication of the growing use of CAT. Indeed, since the Dunkel volume, the number of CBT and CAT instruments developed by academic and testing organizations has continued to increase. Many universities and virtually every major language testing organization are engaged in the development of CBT or CAT. Brigham Young University was a pioneer in developing French, German, and Spanish CAT instruments used for placement at universities. The Educational Testing Service in 1998 launched CBT TOEFL in the in US and in numerous countries around the world. The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES) also developed CAT instruments in various languages and for various purposes. More specifically, UCLES developed CommuniCAT primarily for language programs in academic settings and BULATS (Business Language Testing Service) for the corporate sector. Languages targeted in these tests include English, French, German, and Spanish. In addition, the Council of Europe has sponsored the DIALANG project, which provides diagnostic assessment in 14 languages. Coupled with this proliferation of CBT and CAT instruments has been a steady flow of publications on the topic. These publications include those by Brown and Iwashita (1996, 1998); Young, Shermis,","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Using multinomial modelling, this article examines the class distribution (using the NS-SEC scheme) given levels of education and gender. The analysis of ethnicity, age, gender, marital status and number of children in relation to employment suggests that there are no universal characterizations that can be founded on any of these independent variables. Although Pakistanis dominate the demographic profile they are not likely to suffer the greatest. Muslim Black Africans experience harsher conditions and it could be argued that there is an ethnic colour penalty that is greater than the ethnic religion penalty for Muslims. The forces of colour racism remain omnipotent, even when testing for the impact of religion on patterns of employment inequality.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Unlike many previous campaigns, neither party's candidate made much mention of problems besetting states and localities. The war against global terrorism and the changing situation in Iraq shaped the election. Progress was made on homeland security, but intergovernmental wrangling over federal grants continued unabated. Federal-state feuds were common in several policy areas, including education, environmental protection, and health care. State finances received a revenue boost as economic growth picked up, but rising costs for Medicaid, education, employee pensions, and prisons clouded states' financial forecasts. The U.S. Supreme Court decided several cases with a federalism dimension, and these decisions plus those of the past several years suggest the Court has moved not so much to grant more power to the states but to prune back the power of Congress. Much of what has happened during the first Bush administration must be seen against the larger background of changes in the American political party system. Changes in party organization and policy control, especially during the first Bush administration, reaffirm David Walker's assessment that over the past quarter century American federalism has become more nationalized.

We found a possible source and factor for its more effective manifestation and development in the direction of the aim generation to the reflection on the cognitive activity in the educational process in Biology.

The authors consider various strategies used to seek organizational legitimacy in the U.K. casino gambling market. The findings are based on a detailed, multistakeholder case study pertaining to a failed bid for a regional supercasino. They suggest four generic strategies for seeking organizational legitimacy in this highly complex context: construing, earning, bargaining, and capturing, as well as pathways that combine these strategies. The case analysis and proposed bidimensional model of generic legitimacy-seeking strategies contribute to limited literature on organizational legitimacy in controversial industry sectors. In addition, beyond organizations active in controversial contexts, this study and its implications are useful for individuals and organizations supporting or opposing the organizational legitimacy of organizations in controversial industries.

This article contributes to analysing the role of the EU as a security actor in countering piracy off the Horn of Africa, by examining three different dimensions of the EU response to this problem: (a) the immediate EU response (the EU military mission EUNAVFOR Atalanta); (b) the medium-term EU response (the Critical Maritime Routes (CMR) programme launched by the European Commission); and (c) the long-term EU response (development and security assistance). This article concludes that the EU has been very active in addressing piracy through its naval task-force to protect maritime transport in the western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, as well as its efforts to enhance regional counter-piracy capacities and thematic and geographical financial instruments. The EU thus has taken up the fight against ‘Captain Hook’.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Stabilizing Sub-Saharan Africa is a vital task that is essential to long-term global security. This paper examines Africa's current situation and the reasons behind its catastrophic circumstances. It focuses upon Security Sector Reform (SSR) as a relatively new but key process that is essential to developing a healthy political environment. The paper examines the roots of Africa's instability and analyzes one example of SSR in Africa. It further identifies the practice's characteristic features, develops a set of 10 operating principles, and makes recommendations to implement SSR on a broad scale across Africa. The paper recommends that to bring Africa to an acceptable level of stability, the militaries of the wealthy nations need to become much more actively involved in security reform. The one nation best placed to initiate and coordinate that reform is the United States with its newly formed Africa Command. Assuming this responsibility means willingly undertaking an expanded range of tasks that are outside the realm of traditional warfighting. Such activity will drive further transformations in the character and structure of modern armed forces.","[{""country"":[""Africa""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The selection process is extremely difficult because there is a myriad of products, because of the dynamic nature of the market and market participants' actions, and because of the complexity of many of the products. We consider the existing types of tools, in particular the rating schemes that have been proposed by industry participants to provide guidance to the investor. We propose a set of properties that a rating scheme should show and check whether the existing schemes carry these properties. Our findings suggest that the existing rating schemes do not carry the desired properties. Furthermore, for the purpose of solving a highly indefinite selection process, an effective rating scheme may not exist. In light of this, we propose the introduction of a new quantity, the floor, that has a legal and financial meaning, on which issuers can also compete in addition to price and spread. Its acceptance and use would also yield standardization towards investors' interests by excluding some pricing practices and severely limiting others. Even though very little research has been produced in this area, we believe this to be a topic of high importance in establishing guidelines for healthy industry development and regulation that upholds investors' interests.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The Montado is an agrosilvopastoral system dominant in Southern Portugal. Due to its various types of uses, the Montado is recognizedly a multifunctional landscape, though future management conditions are still to be defined. In order to ensure the development of rural areas, knowledge about the present state of 'new' functions is needed. While the issue can be tackled from different perspectives, the research presented here surveyed the use and the assessment that different land-users and landowners make of 'new' rural functions. A qualitative survey was carried out through 204 personal interviews with different types of land-users (rural and urban inhabitants, workers, tourists, hunters, mushroom pickers and bee-keepers) and 28 interviews with landowners. The interviewees responded to questions about the activities they carry out in the Montado, as well as existing difficulties and also possible improvements related with their activities. The landowners were asked to describe the current incorporation of 'new' functions in the management of their farms and their motivations to do so. Results reveal that there is a variety of 'new' rural functions in the Montado, such as walking, hunting, mushroom picking and beekeeping. As to the main difficulties, problems were identified regarding access to private properties, a feeling of lack of security due to no information regarding wild cattle, hunting and fire and lack of facilities promoting orientation, such as the signposting of walking paths and tourist information. For landowners, inclusion of 'new' functions in their estate management was mainly influenced by economic motivation. Most landowners included hunting in the management of their estates. Few landowners perceived the 'new' activities as being no more than a complication for the purely productive management of their properties. The present study highlights several aspects that are important for the successful inclusion of 'new' rural functions in the management of Montado private properties. Namely, the economic benefits that 'new' rural functions bring to landowners, the fact that qualified help is needed for landowners in the implementation process, and the importance of a clear definition of rights and responsibilities of land- users and landowners with regard to the functions mentioned.","[{""country"":[""Portugal""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Completed in 2014, the project approached this topic with two fundamental questions: (1) whether the reviewed public library valuation studies provide mounting evidence concerning the contributions that public libraries make to the economic prosperity of the communities they serve, and (2) what steps need to be taken in order to strengthen this assertion? The results of the analyses performed to answer these questions suggest that Americans typically receive five to six dollars for every dollar they spend on public library services.

Analysis of problem-cause relationship through farmer participatory approach revealed that low profitability was mainly due to the reasons of unavailability of quality seed, imbalanced use of fertilizers, improper plant protection measures, weed menace and high labour cost. The technological intervention points identified through farmer participatory approach and implicated on-farm conditions revealed that high yielding medium duration variety Aishwarya out-yielded local variety with substantial higher returns in the project area. Application of recommended dose of fertilizers gave around 500 kg grains per ha extra over farmers practice. On farm research on weed control in paddy revealed that application of weedicide gave an average yield of 2.5 t ha-1 as compared to farmers practice of 2.2 t ha-1. Control of insect pests like leaf roller and stem borer gave additional net returns of Rs. 1105/ha by way of increased yield over farmers' practice.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

From a theoretical perspective, the possible things that happened in Makassar is there is changes in economic growth cause changes in transport activity, meaning that growth in the demand for travel depends on economic growth. The development of the city has not been integrated with the development of social service and economic services in the area multifunctional and does not follow transit-oriented development, so the volume of movement of the population is very high towards to downtown service centers, whereas housing development should be brought closer to the service centers with mixed function and bus stop for transportation mode transfer.

The results confirmed multiple factors such as Social norms, Intention to Act, Information Need and Situational factors significantly influence and shape the nature of pro-environmental behavior in the US and sets of Social norms, Intention to act, Environmental awareness, Information need and Situational factor in China. These findings are in consonance with the tenets of theory of planned behavior, norm activation theory; though the loading and effects differ in their local environment. University students in US showed higher level of pro-environmental behavior despite their individualistic society compared to Chinese students in China. The findings confirms the complexity of human behavior through the robustness of the comprehensive action determination model by showing that using unitary construct to predict environmental behavior is context specific and using different combinations of predictor variables exert significant influences in different local environments.","[{""country"":[""China"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Therefore,stakeholders such as regulators, managers, researchers, etc. are concerned to fix a precise level of long-term sources of fund in their capital structure. DIs are highly levered firm because major portion of their capital structure consists of debt collected from deposits. Thus, capital adequacy ratio is a significant measure to evaluate efficiency and stability which affects the likelihood of insolvency for those institutions. Nepalese banks are applying Basel framework in order to maintaining a precise level capital standard. But, Nepalese cooperatives such as saving and credit cooperatives, multipurpose cooperatives, etc. are not regulated by the central bank, and thus, are not subjected to follow the Basel. In this regard, we evaluated the determinants of the capital adequacy ratio of Nepalese cooperative societies through descriptive, correlation, and regression analysis using an unbalance panel data of 126 co-operatives from 2009 to 2013. The core determinants of capital adequacy ratio for the Nepalese cooperatives are credit to deposit ratio, net interest margin and types of cooperative in positive direction, whereas assets utilization ratio, size and return on equity in negative direction. Though, the big sized cooperatives have poor strategic capital, the resulted mean and standard deviation suggest cooperatives? capital adequacy ratio is higher but inconsistent than commercial banks.","[{""country"":[""Nepal""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Furthermore the term ‘radical’ comes up relative to both ideas and groups. Although it may be presumed that groups or individuals who are radical are so because they embody an ideology defined as such, this is not always the case. The “Not In My Name” social movement is called radical because it stands opposite to the ideology held by ISIS. This debate though, for once, does not exist on a spectrum; there is no ‘extreme right’ and ‘extreme left’. Through past examples of similar situations and scholarly analogy it will be shown that ISIS is radical because it has a desire to return to a fundamental root system. Not In My Name, in contrast, is not advocating a change, only a disassociation of the name of Islam with ISIS. Due to the contrast between the two groups it will also be discussed whether public declaration of allegiance should be required, or if allegiance should be assumed until proven otherwise.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The foundation of this paper revolves around crime and real estate supported by background literature detailing external effects on real estate prices to set up the framework for the research on mass shootings and residential real estate values. The findings in this paper are based on 73 events involving mass shootings in the United States from 1996 to 2015. I find that the effect of mass shooting events plays a significant role in the decline in real estate values following a mass shooting event in areas near the shooting event. Interestingly, this response is otherwise not supported by probability data as death by mass shooting is highly unlikely. The resulting economic changes are meaningful, suggesting between a 15%-20% decline in residential real estate prices within a three-year period around a mass shooting location.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study therefore investigated the perceived efficacy of Betula alba (BA) and Sutherlandia frutescens (SF) decoctions used in the management of HIV/AIDS in Ghana. ::: Materials and Methods: A study on the records of HIV/AIDS patients attending Habibi Herbal Clinic, Kumasi, Ghana, was conducted to obtain information on the initial viral load presented during their maiden visit and results after treatment with the herbal decoctions. The decoctions were assessed for immunostimulatory property in cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppressed ICR mice. Total white blood cell count, as well as lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were determined and their effects compared with Levamisole. The decoctions were also screened for antimicrobial activity by the micro dilution method. ::: Results: The two herbal decoctions used significantly reduced (P ≤ 0.001) the patients’ viral loads (47.42 ± 17.28 % to 13.69 ± 12.42 %; n=16). BA (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg) and SF (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/kg) caused significant increment (P ≤ 0.001) in total WBC and lymphocyte count in mice comparable to that produced by 2.5 mg/kg Levamisole. The decoctions also exhibited antimicrobial activity against gram negative and gram positive bacteria as well as Candida albicans (MIC 0.607 to 3.062 mg/ml). Phytochemicals present in both plants include saponins, terpenoids and coumarins. ::: Conclusion: The Betula alba and Sutherlandia frutescens decoctions have interesting immunostimulatory and antimicrobial properties and hence could be useful in the management of HIV/AIDS and associated opportunistic infections.","[{""country"":[""Ghana""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Based on a content analysis of 232 scholarly articles, the literature is categorized into four focal lenses: technology, institutional, viability and user-centric. We find that the first two dominate the RE debate. The viability lens has been used less frequently, whilst the user-centric lens began to engage scholars as late as 2007. We provide an overview of the technological, institutional and viability lenses, and elaborate upon the user-centric lens in greater detail. For energy policy and practice, we combine the four lenses to develop a business model framework that policy makers, practitioners and investors could use to assess RE projects or to design future rural electrification strategies.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, increasing droughts and water scarcity have highlighted concerns regarding the environmental sustainability of agriculture in the region. An integrated assessment combining a gridded water balance model with a geodatabase and GIS has been developed and used to assess the water demand and energy footprint of irrigated production in the region. Modelled outputs were linked with crop yield and water resources data to estimate water (m3 kg−1) and energy (CO2 kg−1) productivity and identify vulnerable areas or ‘hotspots’. For a selected key crops in the region, irrigation accounts for 61 km3 yr−1 of water abstraction and 1.78 Gt CO2 emissions yr−1, with most emissions from sunflower (73 kg CO2/t) and cotton (60 kg CO2/t) production. Wheat is a major strategic crop in the region and was estimated to have a water productivity of 1000 t Mm−3 and emissions of 31 kg CO2/t. Irrigation modernization would save around 8 km3 of water but would correspondingly increase CO2 emissions by around +135%. Shifting from rain-fed to irrigated production would increase irrigation demand to 166 km3 yr−1 (+137%) whilst CO2 emissions would rise by +270%. The study has major policy implications for understanding the water–energy–food nexus in the region and the trade-offs between strategies to save water, reduce CO2 emissions and/or intensify food production.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

I will review the welfare changes brought in by President Clinton through the PRWORA as this act was the first significant redesign of welfare policy since President Roosevelt’s New Deal (Fitzgerald 2003). As will be seen, social conservative views were written into welfare legislation during President Clinton’s Administration and were progressively expanded during President Bush’s time in office (Fitzgerald 2003, Smith 2007). This paper will conclude by speculating how core values of the individualization of social policy and the role of the father in the family may survive the transition to President Obama’s Administration.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The research reported in this article concerns the interaction between Grade 10 Physical Sciences teachers’ beliefs about inquiry-based learning, and their practice of inquiry in their classrooms. This research adopted a mixed methods design. In the first phase of the research, quantitative data were collected by distributing a validated questionnaire to Physical Sciences teachers in an education circuit in rural Mpumalanga, South Africa. The next phase of the research involving teacher interviews, provided a more in-depth explanation of some of the findings, which emerged from the questionnaire survey. It was found that sampled teachers from the rural district have a positive attitude towards inquiry in the teaching and learning of Physical Sciences, and recognise the benefits of inquiry, such as addressing learner motivation and supporting learners in the understanding of abstract science concepts. However, despite this positive belief towards inquiry-based learning, teachers are less inclined to enact inquiry-based learning in their lessons. Teachers claim that the implementation of inquiry-based learning is fraught with difficulty, such as availability of laboratory facilities, teaching materials, time to complete the curriculum, and large classes, which creates tension in their willingness to implement it.

This is particularly useful in a region of many languages and laws, almost all of whose civil justice systems are enshrined in a civil code. Each civil code will now grant judges the power to recognize settlement agreements obtained through mediation to be enforceable contracts. The directive achieves its main goal: it recognizes and establishes uniform judicial treatment of cross-border commercial dispute resolution throughout the European market.

We sought to examine the impact of resident involvement on outcomes after bariatric surgery using a population-based clinical registry. Study Design We analyzed 17,057 patients who underwent a primary laparoscopic gastric bypass in the 35-hospital Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative from July 2006 to August 2012. Resident involvement was characterized at the surgeon level. Using hierarchical logistic regression, we examined the influence of resident involvement on 30-day complications, accounting for patient characteristics as well as hospital and surgeon case volume. To evaluate potential mediating factors for specific complications, we also adjusted for operative duration. Results Risk-adjusted 30-day complication rates with and without residents were 13.0% and 8.5%, respectively (p Conclusions Resident involvement in laparoscopic gastric bypass is independently associated with wound infections and venous thromboembolism. The effect appears to be mediated in part by longer operative times. These findings highlight the importance of strategies to assess and improve resident technical proficiency outside the operating room.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

First, using firm level data, we show that there is a large price discount for H shares relative to the A shares. Second, when we divide the firms into a high price disparity group and a low price disparity group, we find that the high price disparity group’s pricing information transmission is stronger than the low price disparity group during the pre-liberalization period (in terms of significant mean coefficients). Third, when we divide the entire sample period into a pre-liberalization period and a post-liberalization, we find that the mean value spillover is stronger during the post-liberalization period for the low price disparity group. Finally, we report that during the post-liberalization period, the volatility spillover increases from A shares to H shares while it decreases from H shares to A shares. This implies that there is an information advantage of H shares, disappearing with the liberalization of A shares.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We then obtain approximate analytical expressions for the optical force, equilibrium position, and trap stiffness for a Rayleigh particle. At equilibrium, the displacement for the particle from the focus scales like a(3) (where a is the radius) for a transparent particle, owing to scattering, whereas for absorptive particles it scales like C+Da(2), owing to absorption. The trap stiffness is found to be proportional to a(3), in agreement with the recent experiment. The radially polarized beam is found to be superior to the linearly polarized beam in the Rayleigh regime in terms of its ability to trap. It is found that the larger the ratio of epsilon(r)/epsilon(i), the closer the equilibrium to the focus, and thus higher stability.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Monitoring of disease activity is crucial because the disease tends to progress despite treatment with glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressive agents. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have generally been used as disease activity markers, but these are nonspecific inflammatory markers and lack the sensitivity and specificity to accurately monitor the disease status. Given the histological findings characterized by destruction of elastic fibers, we hypothesized that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) could be useful as markers of disease activity in TA. ::: ::: ::: METHODS AND RESULTS ::: A consecutive series of 25 patients with TA were enrolled in this study. According to the National Institutes of Health criteria of disease activity, 11 were in an active phase and the remaining 14 were in remission. Circulating levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 were determined by ELISA in all patients with TA and controls. MMP-2 levels were higher in patients with TA than in controls, but no correlation was found between serum MMP-2 and disease activity score. In contrast, MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels in patients with active disease were higher than in patients in remission and controls, and a positive correlation was demonstrated between circulating levels of MMP-3 or MMP-9 and disease activity score. The high levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 improved when patients underwent remission. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The present results indicate that MMP-2 can be helpful in diagnosing TA and that MMP-3 and MMP-9 can be used as activity markers for TA.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Four types result from the intersection of two implicit choices made about networks â€“ networks are assumed to be either personal or impersonal, and are viewed either internally or externally. Thus, networks are understood in terms of sociability, access to resources, enabling structure, or social capital. Second, I argue that networks function in a fundamentally ambiguous way. They operate in their capacity of a safety net or survival kit, provide a â€˜beating the systemâ€™ capacity or compensate for the systemâ€™s defects. At the same time networks provide constraints such as high costs of informal contract, limits on individual action, lock-in effects and the handicaps of social capital. Third, I illustrate differences between networks serving the economy of favors in Russia and networks serving the purposes of â€˜network society.â€™","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this paper, I consider a model where firms from two countries compete with each other on a third market. I analyze optimal policy choices of the firms’ residence countries aiming at strategically manipulating the competitivity of their firms on the third market. I show that, as has recently been claimed, countries prefer the tax exemption system over the tax credit system if transfer prices for headquarter services to the affiliate are close to the headquarter’s variable cost and if the third country’s tax rate is low (i.e., if there is a large tax differential between both locations within the firm). However, if transfer prices are high and the tax rate in the third market country is sufficiently close to the residence country’s tax rate, I show that the tax credit system is an optimal tax policy choice for both countries. From a policy perspective, the view that the tax exemption system is generally the best policy response if domestic firms’ competitiveness is a policy goal has to be qualified.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The cognitive literature has been organized around three central coronary-prone behaviors—hostility/competitiveness, low self-esteem, and low perceived control—and for each behavior, the literature on basic beliefs, attitudes, overt behaviors, and person-environment reciprocal interactions is reviewed. A new hypothesis concerning the beliefs and attitudes underlying low perceived control is presented. According to this hypothesis, low control emerges from a belief in pure environmental determinism, where the environment is blamed for problems, and a related belief that the environment is malleable and can always be changed with persistence. Alternatively, high control emerges from a belief in reciprocal determinism which de-emphasizes blame and considers causes of problems from multiple perspectives, and a related belief that the environment may not be malleable despite persistence. Thus, low perceived control emerges from persisting in attempts to control the uncontrollable, while high perceived control emerges from knowing when and how to switch from trying to bringing the environment in line with one's wishes to bringing oneself in line with the environment.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As they began the program, but before any program interaction had occurred, students were asked to complete an online questionnaire (included as part of this report). (Another questionnaire, completed at the end of the first year of the program, is the subject of another report.) The questionnaire asked students to assess their career prospects (career advancement and career change were known, through previous research, to be major motivations of program students), and their expectations of the program. Specifically, students were asked to state how important an outcome was, and to identify which outcomes were “critical” to their satisfaction with the program. The survey sought to determine the areas in which doctoral students already felt confidence, the areas in which they hoped they would gain greater skills or more capabilities, and the topics considered critical to their satisfaction with the program. Results were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, ATLAS.ti, and SPSS.PC. The conclusions and recommendations showed that students expected programs to provide the following: increased credibility; knowledge of the distance education literature; data-analysis and writing skills; enhanced academic prospects; opportunities to do more teaching; connections to other universities; and broad knowledge of technology developments. Also, to meet students’ express expectations, Athabasca University’s graduate programs (master’s and doctorate) should provide a better introduction to fields (enculturation and socialization); more research opportunities through engagement with the working research community; more direct links to employment; emphasis on development of a unique professional,","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The various authors investigate changes in the supply and demand for labor, including the extent to which the private sector has contributed to employment creation, and the groups that have benefited from employment growth. Trends in labor earnings and wages, in women's and youth employment, and in child labor and schooling are analyzed and the role of the informal sector in employment creation is explored, as well as the extent to which the labor market itself has become more informal over the period.","[{""country"":[""Egypt, Arab Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This non-uniformity warrants the use of public transport operational strategies to attain operating efficiency. The optimization of these strategies is commonly being done from the operator perspective, and indirectly from the user perspective. However, the environmental perspective of these strategies, in terms of vehicle’s emission, has not been investigated. This study proposed a methodology to analyze the benefits of using transit operational strategies to reduce operating cost and eventually also to reduce undesirable emissions. First, a strategy-based optimization model is established to minimize the number of transit vehicles required. Four candidate operational strategies are considered in this model, including full route operation (FRO), short turn, limited stop, and a combination of limited stop and short turn. Second, the pollutant emissions of transit vehicles are estimated by the MOVES emission model. The developed methodology is applied to a real life case study in Dalian, China. Results show that the use of operational strategies can not only significantly save the number of vehicles by 12.5%, but also reduce emissions of pollutants (i.e., CO2, HC, CO, NOx, PM2.5) by approximately 13%, compared with applying FRO strategy exclusively. In addition, both benefits can be further enhanced through the use of an efficient payment mode (e.g., off-board or contactless card) or improving bus performance in deceleration/acceleration as well as doors opening and closing at a stop.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This equality standard was set forth by the Supreme Court in a series of cases articulating the principle of ""one person, one vote."" In order to comport with the equality standard, at least every 10 years, in response to changes in the number of Representatives or shifts in population, most states are required to draw new congressional district boundaries.. Congressional districts are also required to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), prohibiting any voting qualification or practice-including congressional redistricting plans-that results in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote based on race, color, or membership in a language minority.. Under certain circumstances, the VRA may require the creation of one or more ""majority-minority"" districts, in which a racial or language minority group comprises a voting majority. However, if race is the predominant factor in the drawing of district lines, then a ""strict scrutiny"" standard of review applies. A recent Supreme Court ruling, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, set forth standards for determining whether race is a predominant factor in creating a redistricting map when considering a Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim.. Alabama also held that the inoperable preclearance requirement in Section 5 of the VRA does not require that a new redistricting plan maintain the same percentage of minority voters in a majority-minority district. Instead, the Court held that Section 5 requires that the plan maintain a minority's ability to elect candidates of choice.. The Supreme Court recently held, in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, that states can establish independent commissions, by ballot initiative, to conduct congressional redistricting.This term the Supreme Court will hear Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, which presents the question of whether partisanship can justify differences in population; and Evenwel v. Abbott, which involves the issue of who should be counted within districts in order to achieve district equality, e.g., total population or eligible voters. Although these cases are currently limited to state legislative redistricting, broad rulings by the Court might also impact congressional redistricting.During the New York debates ratifying the U.S. Constitution, Alexander Hamilton commented that ""the true principle of a republic is, that the people should choose whom they please to govern them.""1 This principle is embodied in congressional redistricting, the drawing of district boundaries from which the people choose their representatives to the U.S. House of Representatives.2Prior to the 1960s, court challenges to redistricting plans were considered non-justiciable political questions that were most appropriately addressed by the political branches of government, not the judiciary. In 1962, in the landmark ruling of Baker v. Carr,3 the Supreme Court pivoted and held that a constitutional challenge to a redistricting plan was not a political question and was justiciable. Since then, a series of constitutional and legal challenges have significantly shaped how congressional districts are drawn. Furthermore, recent and pending Supreme Court cases will continue to impact the process of congressional redistricting, and the degree to which challenges to redistricting plans will be successful.

There are few preclinical animal models to evaluate these strategies. Here we report on a model to simultaneously evaluate both of these treatment approaches. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Allogeneic clot was injected through the 6 F guide catheter after creating >50% luminal stenosis of the common carotid arteries of New Zealand White rabbits. The stenosis was released after 1 h, allowing sufficient time for clot-vessel wall interaction. Occlusion was confirmed and each vessel was assigned to receive either balloon angioplasty alone, intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, Alteplase, Genentech, San Francisco, California, USA), tPA delivery through prototype balloon infusion wire (NIT Therapeutics, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), partial stent deployment or partial stent deployment with locally delivered tPA. The negative control received no treatment. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In vivo revascularization Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score revealed that the balloon infusion wire achieved a stable and higher revascularization score of TICI 2B, with a lower dose of tPA in comparison with other treatment strategies. All treatment strategies resulted in endothelial denudation and exposure of the internal elastic lamina. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The proposed animal model permits reliable and consistent thromboembolic occlusion of the target vasculature and allows for an assessment of both pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization strategies for acute ischemic stroke.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In order to deal with environment problems and generate solutions, it is necessary that the individual be educated, sensitive and aware. For this reason, education institutions and the particular individuals who provide education in the future should make advances in environmental education. In accordance with this idea of the study, the aim is to determine to what degree science teacher candidates who complete their education, who will provide education to the new generation, are aware about the environment and what they know about this subject from primary school to the present. In order to achieve this goal, a questionnaire application for the science teacher candidates was created that has questions about environment problems. Secondly, the results are compared with some teacher candidates' information level who attended different universities and different departments. According to these results, it has been determined that teacher candidates' answers in general in social but not scientific fields who are raised as conscious and sensitive individuals about environment do not have good environmental pollution information. Moreover when comparing three student groups, it is seen that science teacher candidates' information level about environment is more than biology and chemistry teacher candidates, and biology teacher candidates' information level is more than chemistry teacher candidates. Because of this, environment education programs are to be looked over in their details and contents of lessons are arranged with environmental emphasis from primary school up to their whole life. New instruction strategies should be improved and environment educational curriculum is given in a practical and practiced form. In order to deal with environmental pollution at a national and international level, it is necessary that developed individuals who are conscious about their environment and environment problems and are conscious, have ability to think, and find solutions about environment protection be present. In order to realize this goal, it is necessary that environment education be provided to all students.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The first layer of inducible response is governed by the plant following the perception of microbe- or modified plant-derived molecules. As the perception of these molecules results in a plant response that can provide efficient resistance towards non-adapted pathogens they can also be described as ‘defence elicitors’. In compatible plant/microbe interactions, adapted microorganisms have means to avoid or disable this resistance response and promote virulence. However, this requires a detailed spatial and temporal response from the invading pathogens. In agricultural practice, treating plants with isolated defence elicitors in the absence of pathogens can promote plant resistance by uncoupling defence activation from the effects of pathogen virulence determinants. The plant responses to plant, bacterial, oomycete or fungal-derived elicitors are not, in all cases, universal and need elucidating prior to the application in agriculture. This review provides an overview of currently known elicitors of biological rather than synthetic origin and places their activity into a molecular context.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study extends the works of Cicchetti and Rizley (1981) by providing developmental parameters to classify, categorize and identify common and salient problems of children of addicted mothers (COAM). An archival method was used to review files (36 files, 69 participants, male=39 and female=30) from a residential drug rehabilitation facility. Files were reviewed in terms of children’s health and psychological problems and the purpose of the study was to discover how maternal addiction negatively influences children in relation to specific drugs; and to determine the severity and the nature of those problems in terms of how maternal addiction translates to particular problems in children. Results showed that common endogenous problems ranged from biological to psychological problems, with cognitive deficits and emotional wellbeing being salient problems. In terms of exogenous problems, unstable home environments, neglect and abuse were salient. A novel finding of this study was the occurrence of enuresis and encopresis for children, up to the age of 17. Implications of the study are discussed.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The present work is a pioneering study in this field, in which we attempt to survey the main issues and challenges posed to Economic Theory and to the design and implementation of economic policy. Particularly, we are interested in the implications that virtual currencies may have for: 1) The economic principles associated with voluntary holdings of different kinds of money; 2) The rate-of-return dominance by some currencies that may coexist with currencies offering lower real returns; and 3) The state-of-the-art Monetary Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models with micro-foundations. We believe that virtual currencies share some important features of both fiat currencies—whose value is mainly determined by the issuer’s reputation and the people’s beliefs regarding its future acceptability in exchange for goods or services—and commodity currencies, with intrinsic value. However, virtual currencies are typically issued by private agents, rather than by governments, and thus regulation and appropriate monitoring arise as potential problems that we may have to deal with in the near future.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

There is a copy number variant (CNV) in the haptoglobin gene (HP) consisting of two alleles, Hp1 (no duplication), and Hp2 (1.7kb duplication involving two exons). The spread of the Hp2 allele is believed to have taken place under selective pressures conferred by malaria resistance. However, molecular evidence is lacking and Hp did not emerge in genomewide SNPs surveys for evidence of selection. In Europe, there is geographical constancy of Hp2 frequency, indicative of absence of clinal pressures and that modern day European alleles represent a ""snapshot"" of their out-of-Africa migrations. In this work we test for signatures of natural selection acting on the Hp CNV in a sample from the UK population (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC). We present here heterozygosity decay, pairwise FST values observed between ALSPAC and 301 populations from all five populated continents, extended haplotype homozygosity analyses involving the CNV and 80 SNPs surrounding the CNV ∼500kb in each direction, and linkage disequilibrium and pairwise haplotypic analyses involving 160 SNPs on chromosome 16q22.1.

We conduct 3 separate experiments to test Prospect theory, a popular theory put forth by Kahneman & Tversky [1].

Household data were collected from cross-sectional (n = 461 participants) and preliminary childhood case-control surveys (pneumonia cases = 31 diagnosed within three months at a local health clinic; controls = 30). Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) was measured in living rooms, kitchens, children’s bedrooms, and outside areas in close proximity once during the case-control household interviews (55 homes) and once per hour from 6 a.m. to midnight in 11 homes. The household survey showed that children were 1.98 times (p = 0.02) more likely to have coughing symptoms indicating respiratory infection, if mothers were not the primary caregivers. More children exhibited coughing if they were not exclusively breastfed (OR = 2.18; p = 0.06) or there was a possibility that their mothers were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy (OR = 2.05; p = 0.08). This study suggests that household incomes and mother’s education have an indirect effect on childhood pneumonia and respiratory illness. The concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 ranged from 0.5 to 35.7 µg/m3 and 7.7 to 575.7 µg/m3, respectively, based on grab samples. PM was significantly different between the case and control groups (p < 0.01). The study also suggests that ambient air may dilute indoor pollution, but also introduces pollution into the home from the community environment. Effective intervention programs need to be developed that consider multiple direct and indirect risk factors to protect children.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The most important debate was the so-called “Eurovision debate”, which was broadcasted in almost all EU member states. In this study we explore the responses of a sample of 110 young German voters, who watched this debate, to the candidates’ messages and whether exposure to the debate caused a shift in the respondents’ attitudes towards the EU. Combining data from a quasi-experiment, real-time response data, and data from a content analysis of the debate, we find that respondents’ reactions to the candidates’ statements were—on average—positive and that some respondents displayed attitudinal changes resulting in more favorable views towards the EU. Although the direct connection between real-time responses and post-debate attitudes is not as strong as expected, most of the measured effects indicate that a positive evaluation of the candidates’ messages usually results in more pro-European attitudes. Furthermore, we find no strong evidence that political knowledge moderates debate effects. In general, differences between political ‘novices’ and political ‘experts’ tend to be rare.","[{""country"":[""European Union"",""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Such judgments negatively value the act of self-harm and lead to the discriminatory treatment of self-harmers in accident and emergency departments and upon psychiatric wards. This article argues that the treatment of self-harmers in such environments has its origins in a “moral code” that negatively values the act of self-harm in comparison to (a) suicide, (b) the accident victim, and (c) individuals considered to be “genuinely” physically ill. The article fulfi lls two functions. First, it tracks the history of “medicine’s moral code” as it surrounds self-harm in the British context during the period 1950–2000. Then it turns to examine the ways in which patients groups — so-called psychiatric survivors — resisted such discriminatory treatment in the period 1988 –2000. Such resistance, the article concludes, creates the opportunity for a democratic dialogue to develop between patient groups and service providers that could potentially ameliorate the deleterious effects of medicine’s moral code. The article’s tone is polemical and is expressly written from a perspective sympathetic to the political claims of “survivors,” which the authors conclude forms a central component in the development of democratic practices within medicine and psychiatry.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Our modular biotin-streptavidin coupling strategy enables positively charged TAT-peptide to coat oligonucleotides-saturated nanoparticles as a stable colloid formation. TAT-peptide coated nanoparticles with dense siRNA loading show efficient penetration into a wide variety of hESC cell lines. The siRNA is freed from the nanoparticles and delivered to the cytosol by femtosecond pulses of NIR light with potentially exquisite spatial and temporal control. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by targeting GFP and Oct4 genes in undifferentiated hESC (H9). The accelerated expression of differentiation markers for all three germ layers resulting from Oct4 knockdown confirms that this method has no detectable adverse effects that limit the range of differentiation. This biocompatible and NIR laser-activated patterning method makes possible single cell resolution of siRNA delivery for diverse studies in stem cell biology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Any understanding of Pakistan's foreign and security policy begins with an appreciation of the role played by the country's premier political institution, the army. The volumes by C. Christine Fair, T.V. Paul, and Aqil Shah add richly to the literature on the army and militarism in Pakistan. As in other studies, the preoccupation of Pakistan's military with the perceived threat of India looms large in the authors' analyses. The adversarial nature of civil-military relations and the military's mercurial relations with the United States are also familiar themes. These three books stand apart, however, in the weight given to strategic culture in forming attitudes and behavior within Pakistan's military. Fair finds the army's ideology and mentality necessary for explaining the biases in Pakistan's foreign policy. Shah focuses on those beliefs and mindsets in the army that lead to its repeated interventions against civilian authority. Paul shows how the military's thinking, particularly about India, has prevented the country from emerging as a development-oriented state and has instead turned it into a garrison state.While employing a similar normative approach, the books frame their analyses around different leading questions. Fair asks why after almost seven decades Pakistan has been unable to accommodate itself to India's regional preeminence and has stayed committed to a revisionist foreign policy regarding Kashmir, despite the detrimental consequences. She finds the answer in Pakistan's apprehensions about its larger neighbor that are driven more by ideology than security. It is a military fixed on an image of India as an aggressive power whose aim is to dominate Pakistan and the South Asian region. Fair describes a military that uses Pakistan's founding national ideology, Islam, to unify the country against India's supposed existential threat.Paul is most concerned about why Pakistan has remained a security state and has failed to move toward becoming a sustainable democracy. After explaining the historical and sociological reasons behind this failure, he argues that in large part what perpetuates military dominance is war preparation that has siphoned off the country's scarce resources and distracted its citizens from demanding economic and social reforms. Paul points to the state's execution of U.S regional strategic objectives in return for aid as having disincentivized the political elite from taking the route to sustainable economic growth and political reform.Shah explores why the military has repeatedly intervened in the country's political affairs. Drawing on historical evidence, he traces the expansion of authoritarianism to nation-building problems and the conception of members of the army's higher officer corps about the appropriate institutional role of the military in national security, governance, and democracy. Shah finds that the perceived security threat from India, coupled with ethnic and linguistic cleavages during Pakistan's formative years, led to the military's rapid modernization and development at the cost of economic growth and civil-institution building. Periods of instability under civilian rule strengthened the army's belief in itself as the protector of the state against external threats, ethnic fragmentation, and incompetent and corrupt politicians.In the best sense, these are academic books. They ground their analyses solidly within the political science literature and international relations theory. All three books provide deep historical context and single out the importance of political events in the shaping of the military's frame of mind. Largely free of jargon, they are written for both a well-informed and general readership. Methodologically, there are commonalities. Fair and Shah are particularly interested in what the military says about itself as recorded in its own publications and through interviews. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In Experiment 1, reflexive saccades interfered with memory span for spatial locations but did not interfere with memory span for letters. In Experiment 2, three different types of eye movements (reflexive saccades, pro-saccades, and anti-saccades) interfered with working memory to the same extent. In all three cases, spatial working memory was much more affected than verbal working memory. The results of these two experiments suggest that eye movements interfere with spatial working memory primarily by disrupting processes localised in the visuospatial sketchpad. In Experiment 3, limb movements performed while maintaining fixation produced as much interference with spatial working memory as reflexive saccades. These results suggest that the interference produced by eye movements is not the result of their visual consequences. Rather, all spatially directed movements appear tohave similar effects on visuospatial working memory.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

There are still many restrictions and contradictions, born of the particular institutional and political environment of the Russian oil industry at the end of fifteen years of transition, that act as a bar to international integration. Three factors currently define the establishment of relations with foreign investors. First, because of the many different levels of negotiation with Russian companies, the State and the Regions, the decisions are based on complex relations between the various forces. Second, the reforms, and especially privatisation and the allocation of rights of ownership to deposits, are considered by sizeable sections of public opinion and many political classes to be illegitimate, thus making the issue of international investment and foreign presence still more complicated. Finally, the State's wish to take back the oil industry in order to use it to fulfil its economic and foreign policies is creating further uncertainty.

Species distribution models, however, frequently assume a population at equilibrium in both time and space. Studies of habitat selection have repeatedly shown the difficulty of estimating resource selection if the scale or extent of analysis is incorrect. Here, we present a multi-step approach to estimate the realized and potential distribution of the endangered giant kangaroo rat. First, we estimate the potential distribution by modeling suitability at a range-wide scale using static bioclimatic variables. We then examine annual changes in extent at a population-level. We define ""available"" habitat based on the total suitable potential distribution at the range-wide scale. Then, within the available habitat, model changes in population extent driven by multiple measures of resource availability. By modeling distributions for a population with robust estimates of population extent through time, and ecologically relevant predictor variables, we improved the predictive ability of SDMs, as well as revealed an unanticipated relationship between population extent and precipitation at multiple scales. At a range-wide scale, the best model indicated the giant kangaroo rat was limited to areas that received little to no precipitation in the summer months. In contrast, the best model for shorter time scales showed a positive relation with resource abundance, driven by precipitation, in the current and previous year. These results suggest that the distribution of the giant kangaroo rat was limited to the wettest parts of the drier areas within the study region. This multi-step approach reinforces the differing relationship species may have with environmental variables at different scales, provides a novel method for defining ""available"" habitat in habitat selection studies, and suggests a way to create distribution models at spatial and temporal scales relevant to theoretical and applied ecologists.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We use a diffusion of price comparison model to examine the effects of the relative proportions of switcher and loyal segments on firms' pricing decisions. This analysis shows that the increasing numbers of price comparison-shoppers pull prices down, and the rate at which prices decrease is shaped by the diffusion curve and the brand preference. Our analysis shows that stores with loyal customers or with a preference for their brands can attain higher profits further into the diffusion process.

Vitamin E (Vit E) has antioxidant properties. Objective: To determine the microscopic changes in the diabetic testis with metformin alone or with Vit E and which of them are better to preserve the testicular structure. Materials and Methods: Fifty adult albino rats, were equally divided into five groups: Group 1: control group; group 2: diabetic group (diabetes was induced by (65 mg/kg; i.p) single dose of streptozotocin (STZ); group 3: vit.E-treated diabetic group (200 mg/kg/day) ip; group 4: Metformin-treated diabetic group (100 mg/kg/day) and group 5 Metformin and vit.E-treated diabetic group for eight weeks. Levels of testosterone, insulin and blood sugar were analyzed and testes specimens were prepared for light microscope and immunohistochemical detection of androgen receptor (AR) and caspase-3. Results: In diabetic group showed irregular seminiferous tubules with depletion, separation, vacuolation of the spermatogenic cells with perivascular and intertubular fibrosis also, the mean diameter of tubules significantly decreases. There are negative immunoexpressions of AR with positive caspase-3. Sections of metformin treated diabetic group showed incomplete or partial regeneration of germ cells while in group 4 and 5 showed almost complete regeneration of spermatogenic cells with increase in mean diameter of tubules, significantly increases in AR and decreases in caspase-3 expression. Conclusion: D.M produce damage in the testicular tissue and the concomitant administration of vit-E with metformin was shown better effect than metformin alone.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We compare this discussion to the reviews on the same topic appearing in the South African Journal of Psychology a decade ago. We find that there are several changes in focus in the research on pregnancy amongst young women.

Results show that earnings careers markedly differ between public and private sectors. In particular, for private sector workers, the life cycle of earnings matters in the formation of earnings differentials, i.e., the data reveal the presence of heterogeneity of earnings growth rates. On the other hand, public sector data indicate that earnings growth is homogeneous over the life cycle and, as a consequence, initial earnings differences tend to persist over the career. Earnings uncertainty is found to be negligible in the public sector, suggesting that it provides more stable earnings careers.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The latter debate arose in response to Kuhn’s work The Structure of Scientic Revolutions , in which he argued that while there exists a process through which scientic understanding evolves from primitive to increasingly rened ideas, it does not describe progress ’toward’ anything. Kuhn’s work was then used to argue that there is no such thing as a knowable objective reality, a view much in agreement with that of the instrumentalist. This paper argues that a generalized version of the correspondence principle applied to a theory’s domain of validity is an exclusive feature of science which distinguishes it from socially constructed phenomena and thereby supports the realist position. According to this argument, progress in science can be characterized as the replacement of old paradigms by new ones with greater domains of validity which obey the correspondence principle where the two paradigms overlap. This characterization, however, is susceptible to the instrumentalist objection that it does not t the transition from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics. In response, it is required that this argument depend on the intactness of certain core concepts in the face of experimental challenge within some regions of the theory’s original domain of validity.

We learned that inflation volatility exerts the largest overall impact, followed by personal consumption expenditure volatility, while the commercial and industrial loans produce a small (although significant) effect. We found evidences of a U-shaped impact of policy uncertainty upon volatility. However, the net effect is direct: an increase in uncertainty leads to an overall increase in economic volatility.

At the centre of this debate is the inability of states to serve the security needs of their citizens. Perhaps it is just a realisation that, despite perceptions to the contrary, the state has historically never been able to provide adequate security, and that the current inability is by no means unique to modern society. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the state has become just one of the providers of safety and security – with private security (in its various incarnations) – increasingly assuming more of a role in the provision of security than the state. The role of the state is being toned down from that of the primary provider of safety and security, as anticipated, to that of a ‘regulatory’ organ. The role of the state has been observed as that of steering the boat rather than rowing it.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, many of the underlying fundamental photophysical mechanisms in this material such as the perovskite transition band structure as well as the dependent relationship between the carrier properties and lattice properties still lack sufficient understanding. Here, we elucidated the fundamental band structure of the pure CH3NH3PbI3−xClx pervoskite lattice, and then reported about the dependent relationship between the free charge carrier characteristic and the different CH3NH3PbI3−xClx pervoskite lattice thin films utilizing femtosecond time-resolved pump–probe technologies. The data demonstrated that the pure perovskite crystal band structure should only have one conduction and one valence band rather than dual valences, and the pure perovskite lattice could trigger more free charge carriers with a slower recombination rate under an identical pump intensity compared with the impurities doped perovskite crystal. We also investigated the perovskite film performance when exposed to moisture and water, the corresponding results gave us a dip in the optimization of the performance of perovskite based devices, and so as a priority this material should be isolated from moisture (water). This work may propose a deeper perspective on the comprehension for this material and it is useful for future optimization of applications in photovoltaic and light emission devices.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In the pragmadialectical approach, a distinction is made between three main categories of argumentation schemes: argumentation based on a causal relation, argumentation based on a relation of analogy and argumentation based on a symptomatic relation [2]. A similar division of types of schemes can be found in the classical rhetorical literature, in the traditional American debate textbooks and in the work of modern rhetoricians such as Weaver [7]. In a research project on argumentative indicators Frans van Eemeren, Peter Houtlosser and I are carrying out, we investigate which clues in the verbal presentation can be used to reconstruct the relationship on which an argumentation is based and to determine what type of argument is used. The project is embedded in the theoretical framework of the pragma-dialectical approach to argumentation. Its aim is to make a systematic inventory of the verbal means used in the Dutch language to express an argumentative function of language use, to classify these means in terms of the ideal model of a critical discussion and to identify the conditions under which they can fulfil a specific argumentative function. In our project we pay attention to all elements that are crucial to the evaluation of the argument and need to be represented in an analytic overview of an argumentative text or discussion, such as the type of dispute, the argumentation structure and the argumentation schemes. For each discussion stage we establish which words and expressions can function as indicators of the relevant moves in that particular stage and as indicators of the relations between these moves. Each type of argumentation has its own assessment criteria: for each type of justificatory relation different critical questions are relevant. Someone who makes use of a particular argumentation scheme, thereby takes the first step in a dialectical testing procedure that requires the arguer to deal with specific forms of criticism in order to defend the standpoint successfully (see van Eemeren, ’The importance of being understood’) . In anticipation of possible criticism, the protagonist of a standpoint can follow up his argument with further arguments dealing with relevant objections. In a fully externalized discussion, the reactions of the opponent will relate to the evaluation issues that are relevant to the argumentation scheme concerned. It is therefore not only in the presentation of the argumentation itself, but also in the critical reactions of the opponent, and in the speaker’s follow-up to his argument, that clues can be found as to the type of relation between argument and standpoint. In this paper, I shall illustrate our approach to argumentative indicators by discussing various types of indicators of symptomatic argumentation.

Through our coordination role for the United Kingdom government we provide opening up physical and virtual forums for researchers and government science and policy staff to learn about and assess the gaps and uncertainties of the evidence base. Closing-down mechanisms are vital to policy cycles, in that they distil what is known and what is unknown. The Diffuse Pollution User Manual provides a valuable tool for policy and catchment management staff to assess the potential effectiveness of different combinations of remedial diffuse-pollution mitigation methods. It is vital that that opening-up and closing-down mechanisms are iteratively linked given the complexity and uncertainty of the science and policy cycles.

EEG findings and prognosis in post-anoxic encephalopathy: A Brazilian experience","Introduction Prognostication after cardiac arrest (CA) poses a challenge to physicians, as it may lead to futile treatment in some cases, and withdrawal of life support therapy (WLST) in others. Clinical and neurophysiological data – electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) – are used as prognostic features. In this study, we aimed at analyzing data of patients who survived CA, in a hospital setting in Brazil, where care is not withdrawn even in patients with expected poor neurological outcome. Methods We reviewed clinical and neurophysiological data of patients who had EEG after CA from 2006 to 2016. We considered background suppression, burst-suppression, periodic discharges, and status epilepticus (SE) as ‘malignant’ EEG patterns. Neurologic disability was measured according to the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Scores from 4 to 6 were considered poor outcome. Results 32 patients had EEG after CA. Age ranged from 47 to 98 years (mean 71.6). The majority of patients had in-hospital CA (75%) and the most common cause was hypoxia. 37% received therapeutic hypothermia (TH) as standard care. 73% of patients had poor outcome; 63% of these had a ‘malignant’ EEG pattern after CA. However, 45% of patients who had favorable outcome also had a ‘malignant’ EEG pattern after CA. Patients who received TH presented more ‘malignant’ EEG patterns, compared with those who did not (66% vs 50%). ‘Malignant’ EEG patterns were seen in most of the patients, regardless of CA local (in-hospital 54% vs out-of-hospital 62%). Conclusion Our results emphasize that good outcome may be achieved even if face of ‘malignant’ EEG patterns, and this should be considered when WLST is evaluated.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Many states have incorporated some variation of the public trust doctrine into their statutes, constitutions, or common law. The application of the public trust doctrine, however, has been challenged as constituting a Fifth Amendment regulatory taking of private property under the United States Constitution, giving rise to the need for just compensation. This type of application of the public trust doctrine was at issue in the nearly decade-long saga culminating in the decision of Palazzolo v. State. The case featured an owner of marshland property who sought compensation for Rhode Island’s denial of his repeated development requests. The Rhode Island Superior Court in Palazzolo ultimately held that the state’s denial of the landowner’s requests did not constitute a regulatory taking. This Comment analyzes the role that the public trust doctrine played in the court’s weighing of the various factors in a regulatory takings analysis. Further, this Comment argues that the public trust doctrine, as applied in Palazzolo, represents a tremendously powerful means for states to set aside publically valuable swaths of land, a means capable of withstanding even a constitu-","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

While there is significant interest in graph databases and querying techniques, less research has focused on helping analysts make sense of underlying patterns within a group of subgraph results. Visualizing graph query results is challenging, requiring effective summarization of a large number of subgraphs, each having potentially shared node-values, rich node features, and flexible structure across queries. We present VIGOR, a novel interactive visual analytics system, for exploring and making sense of query results. VIGOR uses multiple coordinated views, leveraging different data representations and organizations to streamline analysts sensemaking process. VIGOR contributes: (1) an exemplar-based interaction technique, where an analyst starts with a specific result and relaxes constraints to find other similar results or starts with only the structure (i.e., without node value constraints), and adds constraints to narrow in on specific results; and (2) a novel feature-aware subgraph result summarization. Through a collaboration with Symantec, we demonstrate how VIGOR helps tackle real-world problems through the discovery of security blindspots in a cybersecurity dataset with over 11,000 incidents. We also evaluate VIGOR with a within-subjects study, demonstrating VIGOR's ease of use over a leading graph database management system, and its ability to help analysts understand their results at higher speed and make fewer errors.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The aim is to compare the ranges and kinds of these words in parentchild interaction and to consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of early lexical development. Color term data were drawn from the Gleason corpus in CHILDES: 12 boys and 12 girls ranging in age from 25-62 months, and their parents. Results showed that parents used and emphasized only the same 10 most basic colors, with many teaching episodes. Parents’ most frequent terms, red, blue, and green were also children’s most frequent terms and are the ones acquired earliest according to MacArthur Bates lexical norms. In the second study CLAN programs were used to identify animal names in corpora from a variety of families in CHILDES, with 44 children ranging in age from 1;6-6;2. Children and parents produced a remarkable number and range of animal terms, with individual preschoolers naming as many as 96 different, often rare, animals, such as crocodile and pelican. Parents and children thus attend to the same limited set of basic color terms. By contrast, biophilia, our shared human love of the living world is reflected in children’s extensive animal lexicon.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We identify four scenarios of adaptation and use qualitative data to examine their empirical prevalence. We suggest that when the compatibility gap is large, there is greater likelihood that formalized techniques will be captured by and integrated into existing organizational dynamics (corruption of the technique) than that the technique will change these dynamics in a way consistent with its objectives (transformation of the organization).

Kafka’s The Trial reflects how people struggle with their own social and political dilemmas in a Kafkaesque world where the law is impenetrable. Facing similar uncertainty, six plaintiffs in an ongoing 2010 Ninth Circuit lawsuit (Franco-Gonzalez v. Holder) are individuals with mental disabilities facing deportation. The court rendered them incompetent to defend themselves, yet they struggle to do so without legal counsel in an unfamiliar setting while remaining indefinitely detained. This article unveils the parallel between what is essentially an absurd and patently unfair system of law in The Trial, and the experiences of individuals with mental disabilities in American immigration courts. Just as Kafka’s protagonist struggles to prove his innocence in a bizarre world, the Gonzalez Six also face prosecution in a bizarre system that is unjustifiable in American jurisprudence.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

There are limitations to the impact education alone can have, however. There is much acknowledgement that experience in the ‘real world’ of business is also essential (Gibb, 1996; Jack and Anderson, 1999). This is consistent with established theories of learning, where it is understood that conceptual learning, as that which best facilitates application and reconceptualisation, is achieved only through experience and participation (Laurillard, 1993; Mayes, 1995). This is not normally within the scope of formal educational practices. Moreover, it is well established that other influences, such as personality and family role models, are correlated positively with increased entrepreneurship propensity (McClelland, 1971; Dunn and Holtz-Eakin, 2000). The paper seeks to identify latent entrepreneurial activity within the student body at one university, and investigate the factors contributing to those identified as most likely to become, specifically entrepreneurial, firm owners.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To date, 12 nonsense mutations, two missense mutations, six microdeletions and one microinsertion have been reported in the coding sequence and a further six mutations in splice sites all of which were made responsible for the disease. Twelve polymorphisms with frequencies suitable for diagnostic purposes have been detected. A further 28 differences from the published sequence of the coding sequence or the promoter region are described.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Nevertheless, KIPSOs require innovations to ensure long-term survival. To help achieve this goal, this paper explores the role of supervisors in supporting innovative work behaviour (IWB) by considering the unique challenges of KIPSOs and the conditions and characteristics of IWB in this context. Based on our rich qualitative data of a single case study in the Netherlands Fire Services, we demonstrate the ability of public-sector supervisors to engage employees in innovative behaviours. On the downside, implementation failures and a lack of radical innovation projects seem to be the result of loosely coupled bottom-up and top-down innovation projects and decentralization in the KIPSO which requires situational leadership that emphasizes networking activities and lobbying with public managers.","[{""country"":[""Netherlands""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Research has shown that learning is enhanced when empathy or support is provided and that improved personal relationships between teachers and students leads to increased student motivation. Therefore, if tutoring systems can embed affective support for students they should be more effective. However, previous research has tended to privilege the cognitive over the affective and to view learning as information processing, marginalizing or ignoring affect. This chapter describes two data-driven approaches toward the automatic prediction of affective variables by creating models from students’ past behavior (log-data). The first case study shows the methodology and accuracy of an empirical model that helps predict students’ general attitudes, goals and perceptions of the software and the second develops empirical models for predicting students’ fluctuating emotions while using the system. The vision is to use these models to predict students’ learning and positive attitudes in real time. Special emphasis is placed in this chapter on understanding and inspecting these models, to understand how students express their emotions, attitudes, goals and perceptions while using a tutoring system.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Some structured schemes for guiding risk assessment, developed primarily to assess risk in psychiatric patients discharged from hospital and offenders being considered for release from prison, have recently been trialled in the inpatient setting. Against the background of some prior research demonstrating the potential benefits of structured assessment schemes, and some concerns about the practicality of these schemes for assessing risk in inpatients, the current research was initiated to assess the effectiveness of the Level of Service Inventory-Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R: SV) in the prediction of aggression within a forensic psychiatric hospital. Results showed that only a weak association between the LSI-R: SV total score and inpatient aggression existed. This is probably because the LSI-R: SV addresses more static variables and does not assess the clinical characteristics and recent hostility that is associated with aggression in psychiatric patients. The predictive validity of the LSI-R: SV in this context is therefore limited. There might be more effective schemes, some of which were designed specifically for the purpose of assessing inpatient aggression that should be used in preference to the LSI-R: SV.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We found sites with selective responses to faces clustered in the ventral TC, which responded increasingly strongly to marine animal, bird, mammal, and human faces. Both face-selective and face-active but non-selective sites showed a posterior to anterior gradient in response time and selectivity. A sparse model focusing on information from the human face-selective sites performed as well as, or better than, anatomically distributed models when discriminating faces from non-faces stimuli. Additionally, we identified the posterior fusiform site (pFUS) as causally the most relevant node for inducing distortion of conscious face processing by direct electrical stimulation. These findings support anatomically discrete but temporally distributed response profiles in the human brain and provide a new common ground for unifying the seemingly contradictory modular and distributed modes of face processing. Neuronal populations in the temporal cortex fire show increased activity in response to face stimuli. Here, the authors show using human intracranial recordings that face perception involves anatomically discrete but temporally distributed response profiles in the human ventral temporal cortex.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

There are many reasons the young learners have less interesting in reading, for example the development of the information forces the focus of teaching and learning on the critical reading. The most common thing is the students may not know their interest in reading before they start to read the books. Reading interests play a very important role in reading instruction and improvement. Furthermore, the understanding of young learners’ interest and abilities is required to help them in reading.

Methods We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model. Results Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5minutes for LDK and 100minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups. Conclusion Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is widely regarded as the information system through which financial and monetized information is generated for social, economic and political decisions. The youths (male and female), being the future hope of a nation's development, require an understanding of accounting program that will make them take initiatives and decisions to solve financial problems and improve accounting services and performance. On this note, the study investigated gender imbalance in accounting program in the Madonna University, Okija, Nigeria; from 2002/2003-2011/2012 academic sessions. The ex-post-facto research design was adopted for the study and the data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics to answer the research questions, while t-test statistics was used to test the hypotheses. Three objectives, three research questions and two hypotheses were raised for the study. Among the employers, two hundred (200) employers who have worked for 15 years and above, and have up to 10 employees including accountants, were purposively selected from the Employers' Reports sent to the University by the employers, and they were also interviewed to ascertain the employment status of these accountants who are graduates. In gender enrolment, the study made use of the admission register in the Accounting Department of Madonna University, Okija. On gender employment, data obtained from the admission register of the university for the year under study (2002-2012) were used to answer the research questions and to test the hypotheses. The study found that there was a gender imbalance in enrolment in favour of males. There was also a significant difference in the academic performance on gender imbalance. Males tended to perform better than females. There was no gender preference in employment exercise. The study recommended that the employer should sustain the current no gender discriminatory employment practices and the status of accounting discipline should be further enhanced academically and socially so as to attract the females that appear to be status-conscious.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This research aimed to identify a suitable spray application technique, and to determine whether yeast extract added to an EPN spray has an attracting and/or a feeding stimulant effect on M. brassicae. The biological control capabilities of EPN against this pest were examined in the field. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Good coverage of the underside of cauliflower leaves, the habitat of young instar larvae (L1-L4) of M. brassicae was obtained using different spray boom configurations with vertical extensions that carried underleaf spraying nozzles. One of the configurations was selected for field testing with an EPN spray. Brewer's yeast extract stimulated larval feeding on leaves, and increased the mortality of these larvae when exposed to EPN. The field trial showed that a spray application with S. carpocapsae, Addit and xanthan gum can effectively lower the numbers of cabbage heads damaged by M. brassicae.

A hypothesized mechanism of action is an overload of the visuospatial sketchpad and/or the phonological loop of the working memory. The aim is to explore how eye movements affect the information encoding of the visuospatial sketchpad and the phonological loop. Fifty healthy young adults performed two immediate recall tasks from the Wechsler Memory Scale: “Corsi Cubes” and “Digits”. Using a within-participants design, up to 16 repetitions of eight seconds of eye-movement and an eye-rest condition were performed. There were no statistically significant differences between the eye movement and eye rest conditions for either recall task. In our sample of healthy participants, eye movements did not improve the immediate auditory and visual consolidation memory, undermining this hypothesized mechanism of action of EMDR. However, these findings might also be explained by our exclusion of tests that would stimulate autobiographical memory and our use of a non-clinical sample.","[{""country"":[""Spain""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Combined heat and power (CHP) accounts for a large share of Finnish energy production and it is expected to continue doing so under the new energy and climate strategy. However, the current and predicted future electricity wholesale prices encourage replacing retiring CHP capacity with heat only boilers (HOBs), which practically excludes the possibility of electricity production at the site for decades to come. This article analyses the economics of biomass-based heat and CHP production, and the required electricity price level to ensure the economic competitiveness of CHP production in Finland. Moreover, this paper analyses the legal framework within which energy policy measures such as subsidisation can be implemented in order to ensure a functional energy system in the future.","[{""country"":[""Finland""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, studies of the avian visual system have provided a rich source of data contributing to our understanding of visual processing. In this paper we review the connectivity and function of the optic tectum (homolog of the superior colliculus) in birds. We highlight the retinotopic projections that the optic tectum has with the isthmal nuclei, and the functional topographic projections that the optic tectum has with the nucleus rotundus and entopallium (homologs of the pulvinar and extrastriate cortex, respectively) where retinotopy has been sacrificed. This work has been critical in our understanding of basic visual processes including attention, parallel processing, and the binding problem. Keywords: retinotopic maps, visual streams, nucleus rotundus, entopallium, isthmal nuclei ""A good map is both a useful tool and a magic carpet to faraway places"" (Anonymous). Visual Capabilities of Birds Since the seminal studies of Hubel and Wiesel (1968), there has been an enormous amount of work on the visual system in mammals, particularly in primates, which are regarded as having a sophisticated visual system. However, an extensive amount of research into the avian visual system should not be overlooked. There are about 10,000 known species of birds, over three times the number of mammalian species, and it is therefore not surprising that birds present numerous visual specialisations that require sophisticated visual processing. For example, eagles and falcons have visual acuity that is double that of primates (Fox, Lehmkuhle, & Westendorf, 1976; Gaffney & Hodos, 2003; Reymond, 1985; Shlaer, 1972); owls and a few other birds have global stereopsis (Fox, Lehmkuhle, & Bush, 1977; Nieder & Wagner, 2001; J. D. Pettigrew, 1979; van der Willigen, Frost, & Wagner, 1998); the peculiar oilbird (Steatomis caripensis), which spends much of it's life deep in caves in total darkness, has a retina comprised almost entirely of densely packed rods for scotopic vision (Martin, Rojas, Ramirez, & McNeil, 2004; Rojas, Ramirez, McNeil, Mitchell, & Marin, 2004); Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) have excellent colour discrimination (Goldsmith & Butler, 2005); and a wide range of species are capable of detecting ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (Odeen & Hastad, 2003). Even the generic pigeon (Columba livia), although certainly not a visual specialist in any respect, displays an extensive array of visual abilities. This is not surprising given that they have more than 2.5 million retinal ganglion cells and only a fourfold decrease in the density of ganglion cells between the central fovea and the periphery (Binggeli & Paule, 1969). These abilities include: good detection of static and dynamic stimuli in noise (KeUy, Bischof, Wong-Wylie, & Spetch, 2001), detection of biological motion (Watanabe & Troje, 2006) and other complex motion (Frost, Wylie, & Wang, 1994; Sun & Frost, 1998), colour and UV vision (Palacios & Varela, 1992; Remy & Emmerton, 1989; Vos Hzn, Coemans, & Nuboer, 1994), and stereopsis (McFadden & Wild, 1986). The pigeon visual system, particularly the tectofugal system, has been studied extensively (see below). Although a lot of emphasis is placed on the exquisite topography in the primate visual system, such as the presence of up to 30 cortical maps (Chklovskii & Koulakov, 2004; Kaas, 2008), the multiple topographic projections within the pigeon visual system are equally impressive. Moreover, the division of function in the pigeon tectofugal system is reminiscent of the visual streams in the cortex of primates (Milner & Goodale, 2008). These aspects of the pigeon visual system are highlighted in this article. Visual Pathways in Birds As in other vertebrates, there are three major visual pathways in birds, shown in Figure 1. …","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Thus, this study is an inevitable tool for policy makers and sector actors to properly optimize the benefits in their attempts at expanding the export basket of the country. This paper also analyzes theories and several attempts by the government at export diversification, some still ongoing and others not effective due to the changing need of the economy. The result estimation shows that all the variables used in the study are stationary at first differenced and also the Johansen co-integration test confirm the existence of a long-run relationship between the variables. It is of high importance to note that the granger casualty test indicated that there is a uni-directional relationship between Per Capita income and all the variables except Agricultural share of export which exhibits a bi-directional causal effects. This confirm the need for the country to look into diversifying the economy with a view to deepen the impacts of other sector on socio-economic development of the people. The study actually confirmed the assertion of relationship between export diversification and economic growth in Nigeria, using the Granger Casualty test which is the first time this method is adopted in the study of the impact of export diversification of the economy of the country, which has added to the empirical evidence.Keywords: export diversification, per capita income, oil export, agricultural export, manufacturing export.(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)INTRODUCTIONThe need for most countries in the world to diversify their economy, as well as, expanding their source of foreign earning has been the call of most trade exports and economist since the start of this millennium, this which may be adduced to the fact that facts have shown that there exist a favourable relationship between trade and economic growth. Theoretically, it has been argued that a change in export rates could change output, therefore, increase in export is often considered to be a main determinant of the production and employment growth of an economy which is shown in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth (Ramos, 2001).Therefore, since economic growth and development have been the core target of most developing and developed world macroeconomic policies, this then make the process of economic development to be a change in the social and economic structure as countries move from producing ""poor-country goods"" to ""rich-country goods."" In most developing countries including Nigeria, exports (mostly primary goods) remained one of the few channels which significantly sustain and contribute to higher income per capita growth rates of a country. This is as result of high dependence on a product or narrow export basket which often make the countries' economy to be affected by unstable global demand trends. So export basket mix is, thus, becoming the only way to alleviate these particular constraints. By doing this, the issue of global competitiveness of a country's exports will be accelerated as cross-border trade exposes country's exports to global competition.The last decade of the 20th century saw the transformation of international trade and agreements. Particularly, the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995; the establishment and reforms of various unilateral, bilateral and regional agreements has brought about changes in terms of trade. The African regional was not left out in this recent development considering the fact that 56% of African exports are mainly primary commodities. Thus, this transformation has created the need for African countries opportunity to diversify their export basket in order for them to maximize the gains of international trade, which can be through introduction of new product to old markets; new products to new markets; and old products to new markets (Kamuganga, 2012). …","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Although the structural bases for these docking sites have been defined by crystallography studies, it has not been determined whether these sites are available in the native state of Alix. In the present study, we demonstrate that these two docking sites are unavailable in recombinant Alix under native conditions and that their availabilities can be induced by detergents. In HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cell lysates, these two docking sites are not available in cytosolic Alix, but are available in membrane-bound Alix. These findings show that the native state of Alix does not have a functional Bro1 domain and predict that Alix's involvement in endosomal sorting and other ESCRT-linked processes requires an activation step that relieves the autoinhibition of the Bro1 domain.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

For example, in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) the hallmark feature is the presence of recurrent sensory images of a past trauma, known as ‘flashbacks’. These flashbacks comprise the key information that needs to be addressed in cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) to treat this disorder successfully. Another example of imagery having a key role in maintaining clinical problems is social phobia. Clients with social phobia are concerned about how they come across to other people. They spontaneously generate distorted negative images of themselves performing poorly in social situations. These idiosyncratic images represent the clients’ key fears. The images are often stereotyped, with the same imagery being generated across a range of anxiety-provoking social situations. When the images are generated, the clients feel more anxious and believe that others can see their symptoms of anxiety. Research that has manipulated self-imagery in social phobia has shown that negative imagery has a key role in maintaining the disorder. Anxious imagery often relates to a memory of an earlier aversive or traumatic situation, but the clients experience it as if it is happening in the ‘here and now’ and that the imagery is a true representation of how they appear to others. Clinicians need to assess and target imagery in the psychological treatment of anxiety disorders. CBT has techniques to target imagery and the associated traumatic memories across anxiety disorders.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

With the passing years many studies (observations) to explain the causes of dyslexia and to show the newest interventions in this field has been made. People withdyslexia have to overcome quite a few barriersduring theirlivesin order to be able to fulfiltheir dreams and achieve their targets. The fact that some of themare not assessedat an earlyage can affect their self-esteemand theirself-concept. Once theyare assessedresearch has proved that people with dyslexia learnbetter once they aretaught in their preferred learning style(Mortimore, 2003). In dyslexia one of the most commonly missed areas is the emotional side. Teachers and parents are very good at noticing problems with reading, writing, spelling and even maths. They can miss the growing element of lack of motivation, low self-esteem and upset which develops as the child goes through school and the pressures grow greater and greater. The frustration of children with dyslexia often centers on their inability to meet expectations. Their parents and teachers see a bright, enthusiastic child who is not learning to read and write. Time and again, dyslexics and their parents hear, ""He's such a bright child; if only he would try harder."" Ironically, no one knows exactly how hard the dyslexic is trying. The pain of failing to meet other people's expectations is surpassed only by dyslexics' inability to achieve their goals. This is particularly true of those who develop perfectionistic expectations in order to deal with their anxiety. They grow up believing that it is ""terrible"" to make a mistake. However, their learning disability, almost by definition means that these children will make many ""careless"" or ""stupid"" mistakes. This is extremely frustrating to them, as it makes them feel chronically inadequate. Thisinthe long termcan cause thema lot ofproblems in their personaland social life.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

During SIRS and MODS, the intestinal barrier function was seriously damaged accompanied by the occurrence of gut-derived infection which forms a “second hit summit” by inflammatory overabundance. Gastrointestinal microecology, namely the biologic barrier, could be transformed into a pathogenic state, which is called microflora dysbiosis when interfered by the inflammatory stress during AP. More and more evidences indicate that gastrointestinal microflora dysbiosis plays a key role in “the second hit” induced by AP gut-derived infection. Therefore, the maintenance of gastrointestinal microecology balance is likely to provide an effective method in modulating systemic infection of AP. This article reviewed the progress of gastrointestinal microecology in AP to provide a reference for deeply understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of AP and identifying new therapeutic targets.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However these expectations have been the subject of relatively little research in industrialised countries. The paper investigates students’ expectations with UK survey data that are superior to those used in several existing studies in various ways, including their coverage of a representative sample of universities and the rich nature of the information on socio-economic background. The analysis first shows how wage expectations vary with time remaining at university, ability and quality of the university. The paper then compares expectations with the actual wages earned by the same cohort on graduation, using data that are drawn from an attempted census of all graduates. This provides a more reliable basis for assessing the realism in students’ expectations than in existing studies. Results support the hypothesis that full-time students overestimate their starting salary, bringing a fundamental assumption of human capital theory into doubt.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Three main features of the model are outlined — basic income, asset and income limits, and a concept of work that counts all activity useful to human well-being rather than counting monetary profit. Knowledge in such an economy is considered in four main stages: production, review, dissemination and use. It is argued that, in the described cooperative economy, these stages would proceed more efficiently and lead to human well-being.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In general, this case illustrates the ethical and legal dilemmas in the reporting of a specific type of large-scale corruption in the media, which involves the denial of all accusations by most sources and a controversial stand by state authorities and politicians on the issue, forcing the media to primarily report rumors or contradictory claims and denials (after controversial files regarding the corruption were made public anonymously on the internet) or desist from reporting altogether (before the files were made public on the internet, due to possible libel threats). The findings question the normative expectations expressed in democratic theory related to the role of the media as a watchdog, in the specific context of large-scale corruption in post-communist states. Moreover, this paper suggests the need to re-examine the methodological aspects of quantitative content analysis of media coverage of corruption.

However, while the societal need for such policies is high, demand for natural disaster insurance typically is still low. While there is ample research on positive adoption decisions, reasons for non‐adoption has not yet received the attention it deserves. Using the case of earthquake insurance in Turkey, this study investigates how public policy makers and insurance companies can differentiate non‐adopter segments and consequently develop targeted strategies to stimulate the uptake of disaster insurance. Our study develops a non‐adopter typology consisting of four segments—state reliant positivist, dependers, adversaries, and uninformed loners. Differences among segments provide policy makers and insurance companies with meaningful insights to design and consequently introduce affordable natural disaster insurance to the market.","[{""country"":[""Turkey""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In: Geerts SJ, editor. Genetics today: Proceedings of the 11th International Congress of Genetics, The Hague, The Netherlands. New York: Pergamon. p. 923-993.) initiated the representation of genetic relationships among human populations with principal component (PC) analysis (PCA). Their study revealed the presence of a southeast-northwest (SE-NW) gradient of genetic variation in current European populations, which was interpreted as the result of the demic diffusion of early neolithic farmers during their expansion from the near east. However, this interpretation has been questioned, as PCA gradients can occur even when there is no expansion and because the first PC axis is often orthogonal to the expansion axis. Here, we revisit PCA patterns obtained under realistic scenarios of the settlement of Europe, focusing on the effects of various levels of admixture between paleolithic and neolithic populations, and of range contractions during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Using extensive simulations, we find that the first PC (PC1) gradients are orthogonal to the expansion axis, but only when the expansion is recent (neolithic). More ancient (paleolithic) expansions alter the orientation of the PC1 gradient due to a spatial homogenization of genetic diversity over time, and to the exact location of LGM refugia from which re-expansions proceeded. Overall we find that PC1 gradients consistently follow an SE-NW orientation if there is a large paleolithic contribution to the current European gene pool, and if the main refuge area during the last ice age was in the Iberian Peninsula. Our study suggests that an SE-NW PC1 gradient is compatible with little genetic impact of neolithic populations on the current European gene pool, and that range contractions have affected observed genetic patterns.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Second, job values have remained fairly stable over time, although workers seem to give increasing importance to the more social aspects of jobs: useful and helpful jobs. The central finding of the paper is that, following a substantial fall between 1989 and 1997, subjective measures of job quality have mostly bounced back between 1997 and 2005. Overall job satisfaction is higher in 2005 than it was in 1989. Last, the rate of self-employment has been falling gently in ISSP data; even so three to four times as many people say they would prefer to be self-employed than are actually self-employed. As the self-employed are more satisfied than are employees, one consistent interpretation of the above is that the barriers to self-employment have grown in recent years.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Extensive and accurate surgical resection is the primary treatment for MTC, whereas the use of external beam radiotherapy is limited. Moreover, since MTC is derived from thyroid parafollicular cells or C cells, it is not responsive to either radioiodine or thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, and therefore, they cannot be considered as treatment strategies. Traditional therapies for advanced or metastatic progressive medullary thyroid cancer (pMTC) are poorly effective. Among the new approaches tested in clinical trials, targeted chemotherapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now available and they represent effective interventions for progressive disease, with additional investigational options emerging. This paper reviews the efficacy and safety of vandetanib in patients with a pMTC, as it has been shown to improve progression-free survival (30.5 vs 19.3 months in controls). Vandetanib is approved by the FDA and EMA for symptomatic or progressive MTC in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease in adults, adolescents, and children older than 5 years. The most common adverse events in vandetanib-treated patients are diarrhea, rash, folliculitis, nausea, QTc prolongation, hypertension, and fatigue. More data are required to deepen our knowledge on molecular biology of tumor and host defense, with the aim to achieve better prognosis and higher quality of life for affected patients.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It arises as a result of harming or not-helping another individual, serving as a prompt for the guilty individual to take reparative actions, known as restitution. The neural regions involved in feelings of guilt are not completely understood, and in particular, regions associated with acts of restitution are not known. We employed a novel social decision-making fMRI paradigm involving decisions to donate to charities, with feedback designed to illicit guilt and a second opportunity to help. Whole-brain analysis demonstrated that decisions not to help an individual in need were associated with increased activity in the amygdala, insula, and middle temporal gyrus. In an exploratory analysis we observed a positive correlation between trait guilt and activity in vlPFC and mPFC during acts of restitution. These results extend models of decision making to suggest vlPFC and mPFC play important roles not only in processing aversive social cues and updating response decisions, but that their activity may support individual differences in such prosocial decisions. The results also support the role of the anterior insula in guilt-related decision making, identifying these regions as potential targets for interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders featuring deficient guilt.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, its detailed mechanism remains unclear. In vitro experiments were conducted with podocytes exposed to aggregated IgA (aIgA)-MSC1097-conditioned media. A total of four groups were compared in this study: A control group (CON); a healthy supernatant group (HEAs); an IgAN supernatant group (IgANs); and a triptolide group (TRI). First, aggregated IgA1 (aIgA1) was generated by heating monomeric IgA1 (mIgA1) from IgAN patients or healthy subjects. Next, the conditioned supernatant of MSC-1097 cells cultured with aIgA1 (100 mg/l) from IgAN patients (IgANs) or healthy subjects (HEAs) or without aIgA1 (CON) were harvested and used to incubate MPC5 cells. MPC5 cells in the TRI group were cultured with triptolide (10 ng/ml) and conditioned media from MSC-1097 cells cultured with aIgA1 from IgAN patients. After 24 h of treatment, MPC5 cells were collected to measure autophagy-related protein levels, including microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), p62, cluster of differentiation (CD)63, phosphorylated-protein kinase B (Akt), Akt, p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and mTOR, via western blotting, immunofluorescence or both, and to determine apoptosis by flow cytometry. All the results showed no difference between the CON and the HEAs. Compared to the CON and the HEAs, MPC5 cells in the IgANs group showed reduced autophagy, which was presented as decreased levels of LC3-II and CD63, as well as accumulation of p62, and an increased podocyte apoptosis rate. This was partly rescued by the addition of triptolide. Moreover, the p-mTOR/mTOR ratio increased in the IgANs group and decreased in the TRI group. Therefore, these results suggest that triptolide protects podocyte autophagy in IgAN patients.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

There are a range of emerge models of engaging with citizens locally to allow them to express the ways these problems impact upon their local communities to universities as a first step in the research necessary to solve those problems. But there is a risk in trying to upscale these activities into strategic university goals in crowding out. It is university scholars engaged with communities that will deliver improved local engagement, and universities need to find ways to empower these engaged scholars to stimulate their societal contributions, not creating elaborate internal structures and global networks.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Toxicofera reptiles are characterized by serous-secreting mandibular or maxillary glands with heightened levels of protein expression. These glands are the core anatomical components of the toxicoferan venom system, which exists in myriad points along an evolutionary continuum. Neofunctionalisation of toxins is facilitated by positive selection at functional hotspots on the ancestral protein and venom proteins have undergone dynamic diversification in helodermatid and varanid lizards as well as advanced snakes. A spectacular point on the venom system continuum is the long-glanded blue coral snake (Calliophis bivirgatus), a specialist feeder that preys on fast moving, venomous snakes which have both a high likelihood of prey escape but also represent significant danger to the predator itself. The maxillary venom glands of C. bivirgatus extend one quarter of the snake’s body length and nestle within the rib cavity. Despite the snake’s notoriety its venom has remained largely unstudied. Here we show that the venom uniquely produces spastic paralysis, in contrast to the flaccid paralysis typically produced by neurotoxic snake venoms. The toxin responsible, which we have called calliotoxin (δ-elapitoxin-Cb1a), is a three-finger toxin (3FTx). Calliotoxin shifts the voltage-dependence of NaV1.4 activation to more hyperpolarised potentials, inhibits inactivation, and produces large ramp currents, consistent with its profound effects on contractile force in an isolated skeletal muscle preparation. Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) are a particularly attractive pharmacological target as they are involved in almost all physiological processes including action potential generation and conduction. Accordingly, venom peptides that interfere with NaV function provide a key defensive and predatory advantage to a range of invertebrate venomous species including cone snails, scorpions, spiders, and anemones. Enhanced activation or delayed inactivation of sodium channels by toxins is associated with the extremely rapid onset of tetanic/excitatory paralysis in envenomed prey animals. A strong selection pressure exists for the evolution of such toxins where there is a high chance of prey escape. However, despite their prevalence in other venomous species, toxins causing delay of sodium channel inhibition have never previously been described in vertebrate venoms. Here we show that NaV modulators, convergent with those of invertebrates, have evolved in the venom of the long-glanded coral snake. Calliotoxin represents a functionally novel class of 3FTx and a structurally novel class of NaV toxins that will provide significant insights into the pharmacology and physiology of NaV. The toxin represents a remarkable case of functional convergence between invertebrate and vertebrate venom systems in response to similar selection pressures. These results underscore the dynamic evolution of the Toxicofera reptile system and reinforces the value of using evolution as a roadmap for biodiscovery.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The model we use in this paper is a version of the New Keynesian model with an IS-Phillips curve as was used in Christiano, Tranbandt, and Walentin (2011). We consider two additional elements of the model that characterize the environment of uncertainty: (i) private agents form forward looking expectations via adaptive learning in the presence of parameter uncertainty, and (ii) the central bank that conducts monetary policy confronts uncertainty about working capital channel. In the presence of parameter uncertainty the central bank adopts two approaches for conducting monetary policy: robust control and feedback control (Bayesian updating algorithm). We study how these two approaches are implemented in an environment of bounded rationality. Also, we evaluate three different policy schemes, policy under rational expectation (perfect information), policy based on the robust control, and policy based on the feedback (Bayesian) control, by examining which policy achieves better outcome for economic stability. Our quantitative analysis shows that the robust control policy achieves the best result under discretion. However, the robust control policy shows the worst performance under commitment. Also, for policies based on perfect information and the feedback control under commitment outperform those under discretion.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Yet behavioral decision-making data suggest a contrary biological drive to minimize cognitive effort by solving problems using simplifying heuristics. Individuals differ, and the same person varies over time, in the strength of the knowledge instinct. Neuroimaging studies sug- gest which brain regions might mediate the balance between knowl- edge expansion and heuristic simplification. One region implicated in primary emotional experience is more activated in individuals who use primitive heuristics, whereas two areas of the cortex are more activated in individuals with a strong knowledge drive: one region implicated in detecting risk or conflict and another implicated in generating creative ideas. Knowledge maximization and effort mini- mization are both evolutionary adaptations, and both are valuable in different contexts. Effort minimization helps us make minor and rou- tine decisions efficiently, whereas knowledge maximization connects us to the beautiful, to the sublime, and to our highest aspirations. We relate the opposition between the knowledge instinct and heuristics to the biblical story of the fall, and argue that the causal scientific worldview is mathematically equivalent to teleological arguments from final causes. Elements of a scientific program are formulated to ad- dress unresolved issues.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Present study demonstrates modulatory effect of Azadirachta indica on the electrical conductivity and cell death in hepatic tumors. Hepatic tumors were generated by intraperitoneal injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine (cumulative dose: 200 μg/g body mass) to male BALB/c mice. Aqueous A. indica leaf extract (AAILE) was administered orally at a dosage of 100 μg/g body mass till the termination of experiment. At the end of experiment, electrical conductivity of hepatic tumors was measured with four-pin electrode method. Tissues and tumors were then processed for TUNEL assay and DNA fragmentation analysis. The levels of TNF-α were also determined in the normal hepatic and tumor tissue. Hepatic tumors had higher electrical conductivity compared to normal liver tissue. An increased necrotic cell percentage along with elevated TNF-α was also observed. Although, AAILE co-treatment resulted in tumors with higher electrical conductivity compared to normal animals. However, the electrical conductivity was decreased significantly compared to untreated tumors. A significant increase in apoptotic cell percentage and concomitant decrease in necrotic cell percentage along with the increased TNF-α level was observed in these tumors. The results suggest that A. indica modulated mode of cell death in tumors and type of cell death had significant contribution in determining hepatic tumor electrical conductivity.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We specifically assess the extent to which occupational factors operate directly and indirectly on exiting events and whether occupations constrain traditional determinants of labor force participation. Based on a discrete-time hazard modeling approach, the results substantiate that the occupational task activities—substantive complexity and physical demands— are key elements of the work environment that are evaluated against nonwork alternatives. In the case of retirement, these aspects of occupational attractiveness function as a dominant and direct force in retirement decision making. With regard to disability, the occupational attribute of substantive complexity operates as an indirect advantage (through higher wages) by reducing the risk of disability. Indicators of career continuity also influence retirement among older workers. Finally, the results suggest that financial characteristics and health problems are central to the distribution of older workers across the alternative destination statuses of retirement, disability, and death.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As a delayed effect of cancer treatment, cardiovascular damage can occur months to years after the initial treatment. Vasospasm, thrombosis, and radiation-induced cardiovascular diseases can all cause ACS.

Shep Melnick’s new volume, The Transformation of Title IX: Regulating Gender Equality in Education (Brookings 2018). The volume recounts the startling expansion of the scope of Title IX in the decades since its enactment. Particularly notable is Melnick’s analysis of the methods by which the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the United States Department of Education engineered that transformation. One important tactic, Melnick argues, was to cultivate interest groups, most notably by carefully seeding Title IX offices in schools and universities across the country. Another was to abjure notice and comment rulemaking, instead promulgating controversial initiatives in ex cathedra, procedurally unencumbered, unilateral epistles (in recent years often introduced with the faux-familiar salutation “Dear Colleague”). Melnick argues that the agency should revert to standard notice and comment procedures. The OCR could thus legitimate its justifiable moves and recognize when it should walk back its more tendentious ones. ::: ::: But it may be the agency’s interest group strategy, rather than its unilateral approach to administrative procedure, that has cemented the transformation of Title IX. The Trump Administration recently initiated informal rulemakings in order to revise several of previous OCRs’ most aggressive “Dear Colleague” letters. But the Trump proposals, and the comments received about them, contemplate a Title IX every bit as transformed as the statute inherited from prior administrations.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We find that this measure worked well in providing an advance signal of past UK episodes of banking system distress. But this does not guarantee future signalling success. We therefore evaluate some conceptual shortcomings of the credit gap and suggest complementary indicators.

(2) We then note briefly some of the many elements that are developed in the other nine papers in the symposium. II CORE CONCEPTS The concept of Global Administrative Law begins from the twin ideas that much global governance can be understood as administration, and that such administration is often organized and shaped by principles of an administrative law character. The contemporary starting point is thus the rapidly changing pattern of transnational regulation and its administration, a pattern that now ranges from regulation-by-non-regulation (laissez faire), through formal self-regulation (such as by some industry associations), hybrid private-private regulation (for example, business-NGO partnerships in the Fair Labor Association), hybrid public-private regulation (for instance, in mutual recognition arrangements where a private agency in one country tests products to certify compliance with governmental standards of another country), network governance by state officials (as in the work of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on environmental policies to be followed by national export credit agencies), inter-governmental organizations with significant but indirect regulatory powers (for example, regulation of ozone depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol), and inter-governmental organizations with direct governance powers (as with determinations by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees of individuals' refugee status, or the WTO dispute resolution system for trade conflicts). Bodies that were not originally envisaged as regulators have increasingly become so. The U.N. Security Council now regulates movements of arms, food and money in areas subject to sanctions, and lists specific individuals whose assets are to be frozen by states under anti-terrorism rules. The World Bank supervises developing countries in their adoption and implementation of very detailed externally-devised standards for matters ranging from the structure of insurance markets to the conduct of environmental assessments. The Forest Stewardship Council, a private entity, has developed detailed sets of criteria for sustainable forest use, and for certification of products from such forests. These evolving regulatory structures are each confronted with demands for transparency, consultation, participation, reasoned decisions, and review mechanisms to promote accountability. These demands, and responses to them, are increasingly framed in terms that have an administrative law character. The growing commonality of these administrative law-type principles and practices is building a unity between otherwise disparate areas of governance. The sense that there is some unity of proper principles and practices across these issue areas is of growing importance to the strengthening, or eroding, of legitimacy and effectiveness in these different governance regimes. Instead of neatly separated levels of regulation, a congeries of different actors and different layers together form a variegated ""global administrative space"" that includes international institutions and transnational networks involving both governmental and non-governmental actors, as well as domestic administrative bodies that operate within international regimes or cause transboundary regulatory effects. And, while norms of a regulatory character have been adopted by international treaties or intergovernmental agencies with great frequency since at least the nineteenth century, international administrative roles and capacities until recently evolved slowly (some important early cases excepted). …","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this context the term “international rule of law” is chosen to designate the more recent and “thicker” understanding of international law. The paper discusses how it can be determined whether this form of international law continues to unfold, and whether we are witnessing challenges to this order which could give rise to more fundamental reassessments.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We present an inductive account of zoonosis risk perception, suggesting that beliefs about the range of animals that are able to transmit diseases to each other influence zoonosis risk perception. Consistent with our account, in Study 1, we find that participants who endorse higher likelihoods of cross-species disease transmission have stronger intention to report animal bites. In Study 2, using real world descriptions of Ebola virus from the WHO and CDC, we find that communications conveying a broader range of animals as susceptible increase intentions to report animal bites and decrease perceived safety of wild game meat. These results suggest that cognitive factors may be harnessed to modulate zoonosis risk perception and combat emerging infectious diseases.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The work culture in Japan reflects this belief system, evidenced by behaviors including working significant amounts of overtime, which is often unpaid, and taking minimal vacation. Japan also has a relatively recent history of economic instability, coupled with negative perceptions of being fired or unemployed, which creates heightened perceived pressures to fit in as an employee. These pressures, on top of tendencies to overwork, translate into an increased risk of stress and other mental health issues, which studies of prevalence have verified. Furthermore, structural and cultural stigma against mental illness and treatment in Japan acts as a barrier to addressing mental health risks among Japanese workers. In recent decades, the Japanese government has stepped up efforts to improve its mental health care system, resulting in some promising improvements, particularly pertaining to suicide prevention. However, initiatives to improve mental health at the workplace are new, underdeveloped, and currently lack scope and empirical-basis. For Japanese workers, work culture, financial insecurity, and stigma are three intersecting mental health risk factors that can be used as a framework for targeted improvements.","[{""country"":[""Japan""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

If primary CA advances to heart failure, most patients do not survive for very long after the diagnosis. ::: ::: ::: Case summary ::: A 40-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for dyspnoea, progressive anaemia, and decreased appetite. He has diagnosed with amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. Although BD treatment (bortezomib + dexamethasone) and medical treatment were started, there was no sign of improvement. Then, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) was initiated. Pretreatment echocardiography revealed typical findings of CA, such as ventricular wall thickening, valvular thickening, diastolic dysfunction, and pericardial effusion. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly reduced, and bull's-eye mapping showed typical apical sparing. After auto-PBSCT, GLS gradually improved and was almost normal after 2 years. Other echocardiographic parameters, functional status, and laboratory data also showed that there was significant regression of CA. ::: ::: ::: Discussion ::: Although the prognosis in primary CA is extremely poor, we achieved long-term survival in a patient with effective high-dose chemotherapy and auto-PBSCT. Global longitudinal strain may be a useful marker of prognosis, regression, and recovery.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Masculinity was the foremost concept behind the definition of a man. In order to gain respect, one needed to establish his own masculinity and demonstrate it amongst his peers. This was especially true in New York City, a standard of manhood was affecting the working class. A common understanding of appearance, attitude, and personality dominated the way working class men carried themselves. The thriving social atmosphere of New York's urban center obliged men to “prove” themselves. It was essential for them to socialize with their peers, demonstrating their manhood as they drank and danced through working class neighborhoods. The desire for male camaraderie brought men into volunteer fire departments, where their masculinity was reinforced on a daily basis. Men gathered in the streets after stressful hours of work as they felt the need to release the tension associated with being a working man. Throughout the nineteenth century a new “manly culture” evolved which ritualized violence amongst men. A sense of competition grew and men struggled to gain respect in society. They were forced to fight by whatever means necessary to protect their manhood. By 1845, the New York City Police Department was established bringing authority figures into the streets. Police officers were to stop the violent nature of the working class but the presence of authority figures only introduced another layer of violence to society. The archetypal man was one who had a manly appearance, socialized with his fellow fire laddies, was always prepared for an honorable fight, and stood up to authority figures. Masculinity dominated every part of a working class man’s life forcing him to do whatever it took to uphold his reputation.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The massive exodus of Syrian refugee in Lebanon has changed the country’s demographic composition in which majority of Syrian refugee comes from Moslem Sunni. Thus, it challenges the other groups of Christian Maronite, Moslem Shia, and Druze that fears for the loss of their predominance in Lebanon. This paper argues that the presence of Syrian refugee has challenged the sectarian balance in Lebanon. This unbalanced condition has further endangered Lebanon security and exacerbated its stability and placed both refugees and Lebanese into serious violent conflict.

Study 2 showed that it was the perception of the female experimenter’s math competence, not her physical presence, that safeguarded the math test performance of women.

These two goals appear to be contradictory, as mortgage lenders prefer clients with a permanent, uninterrupted income stream. For the Dutch context, multivariate analysis shows that flexworkers on temporary/zero hour contracts have smaller chances of moving into home ownership than those on permanent contracts. They also tend to express less preference for home ownership. Because flexworkers often experience spells of unemployment, risk aversion appears to play a role. Our findings show, in the Netherlands at least, that self-employed freelancers do not experience too many problems in accessing home ownership, possibly because of more stable and higher incomes. However, the role of flexible labour is on the rise and policy-makers might consider methods to promote access to home ownership, ranging from mortgage guarantee schemes to mortgage payment insurances. Our research findings may not always be valid for other countries because of international variation in institutional arrangements, such as unemployment benefits, mortgage insurance and guarantee schemes, etc., but, nonetheless, sheds considerable light on this policy issue.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, in many state jurisdictions, judicial participation is allowed or even encouraged in the criminal plea bargaining process by statute or by case law. This Article briefly summarizes some of the issues with judicial participation in the plea bargaining process from a dispute resolution perspective, including how structural issues with the way defense counsel are appointed and compensated, along with the power of prosecutors, makes good representation for defendants less likely. By then performing a fifty-state survey of rules for judicial participation in plea bargaining, the Article explicates both advantages and disadvantages of judicial participation in the plea bargaining process and the creation of a neutral dispute resolution style bargaining perspective. Most importantly, it makes five recommendations for how states can involve judges in the plea bargaining process to retain the advantages while minimizing the disadvantages of judicial participation: having a separate judge or magistrate judge manage the plea process, recording plea bargains for future review, ensuring judges take a facilitative role during the plea process, involving defendants in the process where possible, and holding plea bargains in an informal setting.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, increasing investment in acquiring the sophisticated instruments and world-patented drug prescription quells people's hope to afford the health care service, unless insurance policy allows the access. Concurred with Christensen's framework of disruptive innovation in health care delivery, we observe that the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine entitles itself to disrupt the incumbent health care system. Based on Roger's innovation diffusion model and Davies' technology adoption model we propose a framework to explore the influential factors and their interrelationship with customer's adoption intention towards the integration of traditional Chinese and Western Medicine. Hypotheses are made to conceptualize this theoretical framework and allow the methodology of structure equation modeling (SEM) to test the theory. The objective is to identify the causal links of customer perception and motivation towards the integration with construct such as customer's adoption attitude and intention. The outcome of this study makes a contribution in providing insights for the development of appropriate business model for health care service industry.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

On the one hand, the Parthian Age, stretching from the third pre-Christian up until the third post-Christian century, and in which the cultural driving forces of the preceding Achaemenid and the subsequent Sassanid era culminate, offers a significantly broad spectrum of religious contacts, conflicts and transfers and thus varied forms of transmission, condensation, hybridization, differentiation and suppression of religious ideas and cult practices. On the other hand, the historiographic tradition represents a negative imagology developed insistently since antiquity and whose terminology and vocabulary have also become milestones in a permanent East-West demarcation.

Surprisingly, these concerns have not been translated into legal challenges to trade and investment agreements for their inconsistency with domestic human rights protections. A constitutional challenge to the investor-state dispute procedures under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), launched jointly by three Canadian NGOs, may break new ground in this respect. It is not unprecedented for domestic courts to review international adjudicative regimes against domestic human rights standards. In recent years, however, despite the development of increasingly powerful adjudicative regimes for investors’ rights that impact upon constitutionally protected human rights in many countries, the responsibility of national courts to protect constitutional rights has been largely ignored. The Supreme Court has previously upheld the supremacy of fundamental human rights in both international and domestic law. This understanding of domestic and international human rights protections as interwoven is fundamental to the NAFTA claim. We hope that the increasing recognition of the link between trade and investment regimes and human rights at the international level will help to convince the Canadian courts and those in other jurisdictions to fulfil their responsibility with respect to one of the most critical human rights issues of our time.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Qualitative field investigations, including interviews and focus group discussions, are conducted with stakeholders and key informants to collect data on the scenarios before the SSS and to develop a conceptual framework after the SSS implementation. The before-implementation scenario has one strength, that is, the interest of communities and NGOs toward the SWS–SSS integration, which facilitates the acceptance and up-scaling of sustainable technologies. The after-implementation scenario shows additional strengths, such as community acceptance and satisfaction with SSS. The identified weaknesses are attributed to the lack of community-based organizations, community participation, and inter-sector coordination. The marketing of SSS, the involvement of banks and micro-credit systems, and the reuse of treated greywater have been identified as opportunities. The before-implementation scenario identifies the use of pit latrines and the lack of political will as the primary threats, whereas the after-implementation scenario identifies technology innovations for the extreme cold as a primary threat. The application of the SWS–SSS integration in other cases must be investigated further.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Factors associated with increased risk of peripheral neuropathy (PN) include cumulative dose and comorbidity. Individual genetic susceptibility may play a role. Applying GWAS methods to patients of ICON7 (NCT00483782), a phase 3 ovarian cancer trial of adding bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel, we evaluated the association of heritable genetic markers with PN. Methods: Germline DNA from 437 patients were genotyped using an Illumina Omni-Platform. In a cumulative-dose/m2-to-toxicity analysis, Cox proportional hazard models generated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for the development of Grade 2 or higher PN. Baseline clinical multivariate models of toxicity, stratified by treatment arm, were compared with and without inclusion of individual genetic markers through likelihood ratio tests (LRT), assuming an additive genetic inheritance model. Results: After quality control steps, 396 predominantly genetic European patient samples and 727,683 markers were evaluable. 28% of patients developed Grade 2+ PN. Study country but not pre-existing diabetes was significantly associated with PN in clinical multivariate models; the bevacizumab arm was associated with a trend for increased PN (adjusted HR, aHR, 1.32 (1.0-1.7; P = 0.054). Although no single marker reached genome-wide significance level after adjustment for clinical factors, top identified multiple markers associated with PN were in the pyrin (PYR; P = 9.9x10−7) and RNA editing pathways (REP; P = 1.3x10−6 by LRT). In both, the presence of each additional at-risk allele was associated with a doubled odds of developing Grade 2+ PN: for PYR, the top variant had an a HR of 1.92 (95%CI: 1.5-2.5), while for REP, the top variant had an a HR of 2.12 (95%CI: 1.5-2.9). PYR pathway is associated with a caspase-activating platform, the inflammasone, and Schwann cell damage. The REP affects neuronal structure and physiology in several animal model systems. Conclusions: PYR and REP polymorphisms were the top markers associated with PN in carboplatin-paclitaxel treated ovarian cancer patients. Validation in other trials is warranted.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The Background of Affirmative ActionAffirmative Action is usually, but incorrectly, traced to Executive Order 11246 signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 24, 1965.1 As originally phrased, Executive Order 11246 forbade employment decisions on the basis of race, color, religion and national origin and empowered the Secretary of Labor to issues rules and regulations necessary and appropriate to achieve its purpose. The order also imposed penalties for noncompliance and established an enforcement agency in the Department of Labor, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. On October 13, 1967, Executive Order 11246 was amended to include gender by way of Executive Order 11375. In 1969, Executive Order 11246 was again amended and broadened, this time by President Nixon's Executive Order 11478.2However, prior to Executive Order 11246 there was Executive Order 10925, issued by President Kennedy in 1961. Among other statements, Executive Order 10925 included the following: SEC. 203. The policy expressed in Executive Order No. 10590 of January 18, 1955 (20F.R. 409) with respect to the exclusion and prohibition of discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment in the Federal Government because of race, color, religion, or national origin is hereby reaffirmed. More importantly, and what may be the first reference to ""affirmative action,"" is found in the following:SECTION 301. Except in contracts exempted in accordance with section 303 of this order, all government contracting agencies shall include in every government contract hereafter entered into the following provisions:In connection with the performance of work under this contract, the contractor agrees as follows: (1) The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the contracting officer setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.3Executive Order 11246 even refers to the prior Executive Orders and states, ""Sec. 403. (a) Executive Orders Nos. 10590 (January 19, 1955), 10722 (August 5, 1957), 10925 (March 6, 1961), 11114 (June 22, 1963), and 11162 (July 28, 1964), are hereby superseded and the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity established by Executive Order No. 10925 is hereby abolished. All records and property in the custody of the Committee shall be transferred to the Civil Service Commission and the Secretary of Labor, as appropriate.""4The phrase ""affirmative action,"" as used in Executive Order No. 10925, is not used in the same sense as the current phrase and simply addresses the subject of discrimination.5 Even before President Kennedy, executive orders addressed the issue of discrimination. President Kennedy's executive order was preceded by President Eisenhower's Executive Order 10479, signed in 1953, and that created the Committee on Government Contracts. President Eisenhower's executive order required businesses covered by its provisions to maintain documentation and provide such documentation upon request.6In July 1948, President Harry S. Truman ordered the desegregation of the Armed Forces by Executive Order 9981.7 The order required that there be ""equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Study of Dam-break Due to Overtopping of Four Small Dams in the Czech Republic. Acta Universitatis Agriculturae et Silviculturae Mendelianae Brunensis, 63(3): 717–729. Dam-break due to overtopping is one of the most common types of embankment dam failures. During the fl oods in August 2002 in the Czech Republic, several small dams collapsed due to overtopping. In this paper, an analysis of the dam break process at the Luh, Velký Bělcický, Melin, and Metelský dams breached during the 2002 fl ood is presented. Comprehensive identifi cation and analysis of the dam shape, properties of dam material and failure scenarios were carried out a er the fl ood event to assemble data for the calibration of a numerical dam break model. A simple onedimensional mathematical model was proposed for use in dam breach simulation, and a computer code was compiled. The model was calibrated using the fi eld data mentioned above. Comparison of the erodibility parameters gained from the model showed reasonable agreement with the results of other authors.","[{""country"":[""Czech Republic""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We particularly focused on the socially deprived areas with poor sanitation conditions, as they are one of the factors affecting the transmission of these infections. Within this study, 2760 people were coprologically screened for the presence of protozoan cysts. The analyzed group comprised 1173 men and 1587 women from different regions of Slovakia. The total prevalence (2.03%) of non-pathogenic protozoa species was determined. The prevalence of Entamoeba coli was 0.80%, the prevalence of Endolimax nana 0.58%, and the prevalence of Blastocystis hominis was 0.65%. The presence of non-pathogenic protozoa was more frequent in women than that in men, in all age groups. The highest incidence of Entamoeba coli was found in children aged one month - seven years (0.79%), the lowest in the age group of 19-88 years (0.66%). Endolimax nana was most frequent in 8-18 year-olds (0.95%), where the statistical significance was found (p<0.05). The prevalence of Blastocystis hominis by the age group ranged from 0.39 to 0.95%. We did not find any statistical significance (p>0.05) for Entamoeba coli, and similarly for Blastocystis hominis associated with the sex and age. Although the circulation of non-pathogenic protozoa in the human population is far from being limited to the developing countries, their occurrence is also frequent in the population of developed countries. Despite their controversial pathogenicity, they should not be neglected, particularly in the patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.","[{""country"":[""Slovak Republic""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Author proposes three principles of good accountability. First, accountability should not focus on the way institutions operate, but on the results that they actually achieve. Second, accountability works better when it is experienced in a constructive way, rather than being imposed in an inquisition-like mode. Tertiary education institutions are more likely to appreciate the value of reporting obligations if their relationship with stakeholders, especially government authorities, is based on positive incentives rather than punitive measures. Third, the most effective accountability mechanisms are those that are mutually agreed or are voluntarily embraced by tertiary education institutions. The paper concludes that the successful evolution of tertiary education hinges on finding an appropriate balance between credible accountability practices and favorable autonomy conditions.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Stressful life events are risk factors affecting the psychological health of the unaccompanied refugee children. These vulnerabilities contribute to the increased prevalence of anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic symptoms in this population.

In spite of the large global interest in green farming, scientific literature is not rich in the studies that cover the issues of green farming development. Although previous studies examine different aspects of green business, the factors that facilitate or impede the development of green farming, especially at the national level, are hardly considered. In order to fill this gap in the scientific literature, we formulate the following problem of the research: what opportunities of green farming development can be envisaged in Lithuania? To explore the opportunities of green farming development in Lithuania on the basis of the general features of green business development. Comparative and systematic analysis of the scientific literature, graphic and comparative data analyses, and expert evaluation. The researched has enabled to identify the factors that facilitate and impede green farming development in Lithuania. On the basis of the results of the expert evaluation, the recommendations for green farming development in Lithuania were provided. It was found that the main barriers that disturb smooth development of green farming in Lithuania mainly include economic and social obstacles. Frequently changing regulations on organic farming, complicated procedures of green farming certification and lack of information about the support and subsidies call for the development of a consistent green farming monitoring system and conduct of the efficient green market research. Extensive networking systems would provide the opportunities for green farmers to share their experience and observe all the economic changes: new market niches, demand-supply indicators, new channels of product delivery, etc. Non-financial green farming support measures (e.g. consultations, training, provision of information, etc.) could substantially contribute to the development of green farming in Lithuania.","[{""country"":[""Lithuania""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is argued here, on the one hand, that behavior-analytic work on verbal behavior with children with autism needs to integrate the research body on joint attention. On the other hand, research on joint attention should integrate behavior-analytic principles to produce more effective analyses of basic processes involved. An operant analysis of phenomena typically considered under the heading of joint attention is followed by examples of training protocols aimed at teaching joint attention skills, such as social referencing, monitoring, gaze following, and such skills interwoven with mands and with tacts.

In this paper we aim to step back from this and review the contexts and purposes of eLearning. In so doing we discuss the roles and goals of education; particularly education to meet the often expressed needs to develop skills for lifelong learning and for active participation in the workplace and society. We take the view that, insofar as learning for these purposes is concerned, eLearning is not the purpose. Rather the focuses should be on context, purpose, and usability. Learning can have a number of goals and ambitions, for example to develop lifelong learning skills and strategies and to realize people’s ambitions in life and work and self-fulfillment. These accord with the goals of formal education – although, at the macro-societal level, these goals may be sidelined in the twin quests of creating ‘good citizens’ and socializing individuals into a society. We begin by setting out the contexts at each of the conventional stages of formalized learning: nursery, primary, secondary and tertiary education. We explore the contexts for learning and, especially eLearning and discuss how learners’ needs change over time. Finally, we discuss how eLearning plays a key role in integrating learning and life and learning for life.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Methodologically it uses the mixed methodology of a corpus linguistics approach to critical discourse analysis to examine the websites of 334 timebanks in the United States. Findings include identifying how ideas of strengthening community and social bonds are used by timebanks to construct discur-­‐ sive antagonisms to capitalism. Contributions of this study include extending Laclau and Mouffe’s work on radical political participation to J.K. Gibson-­‐Graham’s conceptualization of economic difference.

Phages in the processing plant environment may play critical roles in determining the Listeria population that becomes established in the plant. In this study, we pursued the isolation of Listeria-specific phages from environmental samples from four turkey processing plants in the United States. These environmental samples were also utilized to isolate Listeria spp. Twelve phages were isolated and classified into three groups in terms of their host range. Of these, nine (group 1) showed a wide host range, including multiple serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes, as well as other Listeria spp. (L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. seeligeri, and L. ivanovii). The remaining phages mostly infected L. monocytogenes serotype 4b as well as L. innocua, L. ivanovii, and/or L. welshimeri. All but one of the strains of the serotype 4b complex (4b, 4d, 4e) from the processing plant environment could be readily infected by the wide-host-range phages isolated from the environment of the processing plants. However, many strains of other serotypes (1/2a [or 3a] and 1/2b [or 3b]), which represented the majority of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from the environmental samples, were resistant to infection by these phages. Experiments with two phage-resistant strains showed reduced phage adsorption onto the host cells. These findings suggest that phage resistance may be an important component of the ecology of L. monocytogenes in the turkey processing plants.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This process takes some considered time and is named “admission process”. However, a scandal happened at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign a few years ago. This event has caused some serious debates regarding universities’ admission policy and admission processes. In order to touch this undesired event, the researchers have conducted this current study. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to bring up the admissions scandal at the university of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign. In order to reach the aim of this study, the researchers have tried to reach the answer of following research questions: 1.

Implications for Competition Policy","In developing countries, the penetration of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is still high, and hence the entry of Natural Gas (NG) networks coexists with the use of LPG by an important fraction of households. Thus, a relevant policy question is whether the number and degree of horizontal integration among NG and LPG providers has an influence on the level of retail prices. Using selfreported LPG retail prices of the largest LPG provider in Chile for the period 2013-2014, we estimate that the presence of a competing NG network generates an average decrease of LPG retail prices within the range [-2,-4%] depending on the econometric specification. Thus, since the presence of an additional competing provider (i.e., an NG retailer) has an influence on the level of prices, LPG and NG may be indeed considered as imperfect substitutes. The main policy implication of this result is that the degree of horizontal integration between both types of providers should matter and there would be room for regulatory intervention aimed at proposing remedies in order to mitigate any potential anticompetitive effect.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This comment challenges a core assumption of this line of thought, namely the idea that if the self existed it would have to be one single entity. An alternative is offered wherein the self is understood as being a plurality. But even though it is different, this suggestion has a lot in common with Buddhist thought.

Attainment of a steady and extended release by encapsulating dual drugs into biocompatible and biodegradable vehicles is the key to enable the use of these drugs for effective inhibition of cancer. In this study, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), a proficient water-soluble derivative of chitosan has been synthesized using chemical route and used for the delivery of 5-Fluorouracil and doxorubicin individually as well as in combination. Carboxymethylation occuring at -NH2 and OH sites of chitosan, has been confirmed using FTIR. EDX and Fluorescence studies elucidate the encapsulation of 5-Fluorouracil and doxorubicin into CMCS. The capability of CMCS to release the drugs in a more sustained and prolonged manner is evident from the obtained release profiles. About 14.9 µg/ml is enough to cause 50% cell death by creating oxidative stress and effectuating DNA fragmentation. Amidst the existing reports, the uniqueness of this work lies in using this rare coalition of drugs for the suppression of breast cancer and in reducing the side effects of drugs by encapsulating them into CMCS, which is evidenced by the high hemocompatibilty of the samples.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Besides methodological issues deriving from the role of a qualitative researcher, the challenges included identifying and inviting participants, managing logistics relating to the interviews, researching in another language, building rapport with interview participants, referral to support services, and self-care. In this article, I discuss what I did to overcome these issues, making reference to existing literature and training that helped me in preparing for my fieldwork. Summarising my experiences, I provide a list of key experiences and lessons learned at the end of the article, aiming to help researchers prepare for their work with vulnerable groups.

This paper asks to what extent low levels of black office-holding are attributable to purely candidate race alone, as opposed to candidate ideology. Using a unique data set that contains information on candidates’ ideological positions coupled with extensive individual voting data, the paper tests whether candidate race exerts an independent and significant influence on vote choice that cannot be explained away by candidate ideology. Estimating a model of individual vote choice, I find that candidate race is largely irrelevant for most white voters when the effects of candidate ideology are taken into account. This is especially the case when the ideological distance between two candidates is large. It implies that when candidates are ideologically distinct, voters are unlikely to cross their party line to support a candidate whom they would not normally support, regardless of their willingness to vote for a black candidate. However, when candidates are ideologically close, white voters are more likely to vote for a white candidate who is pitted against a black candidate. Similarly, I find that the race of candidates works as a strong negative cue for white voters with no party affiliations. This suggests that white voters are likely to use candidate race as a voting cue when the party cue is absent or weak.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Whilst this method is useful on a macro level, it does not capture the degree of value creation undertaken at firm level. Hence, we borrow the accounting concept of residual income (Ohlson 1995; Frankel & Lee 1998) to evaluate firm level value creation. This will allow us to bypass the need to generalising all firms in the same industry and disregard the trade metric in terms of foreign imported intermediates. Using the 1997 financial crisis as a starting point, we investigate top Asian listed firms and opine that these firms are the leading force for a country’s economic growth. We show that value creation as measured by residual income is highly correlated with GDP per capita (0.816) and changes in GDP per capita (0.551). We find that: 1) high income countries consistently generate higher value vs. middle income countries and the latter countries have not created enough value or at a rate sufficiently fast to catch up; 2) oil and gas producers create most value; 3) firms in countries receiving the IMF package suffered from low/negative value creation in the immediate aftermath but rebounded strongly to be outperforming those firms in the countries that opted out; and 4) low and moderately levered firms create more value than the highly indebted firms.","[{""country"":[""East Asia & Pacific""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this study, we tried to show the real frequency of GABHS in acute exudative tonsillitis in Istanbul over a 14-year period. Methods: In this retrospective study, we looked through the patient files with acute exudative tonsillitis who had admitted internal medicine and ear-nose-throat out-patient clinics of our hospital in Istanbul, Turkey between 2000 and 2014. We included all patients with the diagnosis of exudative tonsillitis who had a throat swap and culture. We obtained data from the results of throat swab cultures for GABHS. Demographic data and microbiological results were analyzed. Results: Results of throat swab cultures of 967 patients were enrolled in this study (525 male, 442 female; mean age 21±7 years; range 14 to 70 years). In our retrospective analysis GABHS was isolated in only 105 (10.8%) of all patients. Of those patients in whom GABHS were isolated, 56 (5.7%) were male and 49 (5.06%) were female. There was no significant difference between men and women with respect to infection rate (p>0.05). Conclusion: The incidence of GABHS was also low in acute exudative tonsillitis in Istanbul over a 14-year period. Acute exudative tonsillitis was caused by GABHS in only about 10% of all our patients. Tests such as throat culture and rapid antigen test must be performed as soon as possible to confirm diagnosis when there is a suspicion of GABHS infection but routine or immediate antibiotic therapy for acute exudative tonsillitis in adults is not necessary.

Methods Heart rate (HR) and BP were monitored for 24 hours and morning endothelial function was evaluated in 160 consecutive patients with NT1: 68 untreated (41 male, median age 34.9 years), 54 treated (32 male, median age 40.9 years), and 38 evaluated twice (21 male, median age 32 years), before and during treatment. Results Patients treated for NT1 showed higher 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime diastolic BP and HR values compared with the untreated group. Similarly, HR as well as 24-hour and daytime systolic BP were increased during treatment in the group evaluated twice. The combination of stimulant and anticataplectic drugs showed a synergistic effect on BP, without differences among stimulant categories. Based on 24-hour BP monitoring, hypertension was diagnosed in 58% of treated patients and in 40.6% of untreated patients. After adjustments for age, sex, and body mass index, the percentage of REM sleep remained associated with 24-hour hypertension in untreated and treated patients. Endothelial function was comparable in treated and untreated patients. Conclusions The finding that patients with NT1 treated with psychostimulants have higher diastolic BP and HR than untreated patients suggests an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular diseases that requires careful follow-up and specific management.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

On the other hand, teaching these methods gives us an opportunity to verify individual agile concepts and their effectiveness. For that reason, project work is an appropriate and frequently used form of teaching that enables students to get acquainted with agile methods and, at the same time, provides case studies for evaluating individual agile concepts. We describe our approach to teaching the Scrum agile method, within the software technology course, in cooperation with a software development company. Students were taught through work on a real project for which a list of requirements was submitted by the company. A co-worker of this company participated throughout the teaching period playing the role of customer's representative. During their work, students consistently used the Scrum method and at the end of each iteration they evaluated their experience by means of a questionnaire. In the article, the Scrum method is presented first, then a description of work on the project is given and finally the results of the survey are described.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This phenotypic switching is a crucial component of vascular disease, and is partly dependent on epigenetic regulation. An appreciation has been building in the literature for the essential role chromatin remodelling plays both in SMC lineage determination and in influencing changes in SMC behaviour and state. This process includes numerous chromatin regulatory elements and pathways such as histone acetyltransferases, deacetylases, and methyltransferases and other factors that act at SMC-specific marker sites to silence or permit access to the cellular transcriptional machinery and on other key regulatory elements such as myocardin and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). Various stimuli known to alter the SMC phenotype, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), oxidized phospholipids, and retinoic acid, appear to act in part through effects upon SMC chromatin structure. In recent years, specific covalent histone modifications that appear to establish SMC determinacy have been identified, while others alter the differentiation state. In this article, we review the mechanisms of chromatin remodelling as it applies to the SMC phenotype.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This article suggests that aspects of Luce Irigaray’s philosophy can be productively read alongside the concept of somatechnics as described by Pugliese, Joseph, and Susan Stryker. (2009. “The Somatechnics of Race and Whiteness.” Social Semiotics 19 (1): 1–8). I turn to Luce Irigaray’s philosophy of sexual difference and unpack her challenges to Western metaphysics as well as her proposals for a new relational nonhierarchical ontology, a new metaphysics that enables a reframing and revaluing of ethics. Reading Irigaray’s work alongside this concept of somatechnics offers the opportunities to recognise and delve deeper into the philosophical and ontological challenges that Irigaray’s work presents.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

An online consultation included questionnaires for symptom and growth measurement. Antitransglutaminase-type-2 antibodies were determined using a point-of-care (POC) test. Controls had a traditional consultation with antitransglutaminase-type-2 antibodies testing in laboratories. Both groups completed questionnaires concerning CD-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL), gluten-free diet adherence, and patient satisfaction. Six months later, participants repeated HRQOL and patient satisfaction questionnaires and the POC test. The primary outcome was anti-transglutaminase-type-2 antibodies after 6 months, and the secondary outcomes were health problems, dietary adherence, HRQOL, patient satisfaction, and costs. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The performance of the POC test was inferior to laboratory testing (2/156 positive POC tests vs 13/148 positive laboratory tests; P = .003). Health problems were detected significantly more frequently using online consultation. The detection of growth problems and dietary transgressions was similar. HRQOL (from 1 [good] to 5 [poor]) improved after online consultation (from 3.25 to 3.16 [P = .013] vs controls from 3.10 to 3.23; P = .810). Patient satisfaction (from 1 [low] to 10 [high]) was 7.6 (online) vs 8.0 (controls; P = .001); 58% wished to continue online consultations. Mean costs per participant during the studied period were €202 less for the online group (P < .001). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The primary outcome could not be tested because the POC test was unreliable. Nevertheless, our results indicate that online consultations for children and young adults with CD are cost saving, increase CD-specific HRQOL, and are satisfactory for the majority. ::: ::: ::: TRIAL REGISTRATION ::: Trialregister.nl: NTR3688.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The government's claim that the country is safe for investments is roundly condemned and treated in this paper as a false sense of security. In terms of security, government always plays to the gallery, painting the picture of economy being safe for investments when in truth, the economy is being riddled with all manner of security problems. One of the findings of this paper is that even the gains the country has made in Information, Communications and Technology (ICT) sector, were being rubbished due to security problems, leading to relocation of industries to other neighbourhoods. As the country battles to win a war against social vices with their heavy toll on the resources of the country , Britain continues to create a new model of economic growth built on saving, investment and enterprise instead of debt. Due to deteriorating level of the economy , people variously expressed their views on Nigerian situation. Some pessimists said that economy had been damaged beyond redemption, others believed that the situation could be redeemed through violent revolution; while some others still who called themselves optimists, opined that the economy could be reclaimed through taming revolution such as persuasion, rebranding, workshops and orientation in order to appeal to people's passion for the country. Suggestions were offered to government to avoid policy inconsistencies in its ef forts to reform the economy and embrace institutional strengthening of political, social and economic structures which pave ground for enhancement of intellectual capital growth. This effort leads to capacity building that enhances interactions between social and organizational capitals. If Central Bank of this country were to enjoy independence, the problem of the economy could be properly addressed, in terms of reduction in inflation and unemployment.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We report on our experience at AIC-Kijabe Hospital, a not-for-profit, faith-based Kenyan hospital, before, during and after the 100-day strike was completed by examining patient admissions and deaths in the time periods before, during and after the strike. The volume of patients increased and exceeded the hospital's ability to respond to needs. There were substantial increases in sick newborn admissions during this time frame and an additional ward was opened to respond to this need. Increased need occurred across all services but staffing and space limited ability to respond to increased demand. There were increases in deaths during the strike period across the paediatric medical, newborn, paediatric surgical and obstetric units with an OR (95% CI) of death of 3.9 (95% CI 2.3 to 6.4), 4.1 (95% CI 2.4 to 7.1), 7.9 (95% CI 3.2 to 20) and 3.2 (95% CI 0.39 to 27), respectively.

She further argues that language and communication in property can act as a bridge between the humanities and law-and-economics in the study of law more generally.

It may cause severe social, emotional and occupational handicaps. A multitude of therapies exist, but sympathetic ablation is the only method that may obtain permanent relief. Sympathectomy, however, is not devoid of consequences, compensatory hyperhidrosis (increase in perspiration in areas of the body unaffected by the sympathetic ablation) is the most important and may attain devastating proportions. With the advent of thoracoscopic surgery, several modifications of the standard T2-T3 ablation were introduced. It was postulated that lowering the level of ablation and reducing its extent would attenuate the amount of compensatory hyperhidrosis. Instead of excision, transection of the sympathetic chain or ganglionic electrocoagulation became popular. Published data are, however, still controversial. To resolve the dilemmas, well designed studies are required, in which only one variable is evaluated, the exact level of ablation is marked (and postoperatively confirmed by chest radiograph), the level of ablation is ganglion, not rib, based, and results are quantitatively assessed. A standard questionnaire for data compilation has been developed by the International Society of Sympathetic Surgery, which is willing to assist and promote such studies.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The article also reveals how efforts to contain and regulate gangs flow from their imputed motives, with interventions influenced by whether they are conceived as a criminal or political threat.

Compassion poses difficult challenges for the rule of law. The compassionate response is often cast as a deviation from settled law rather than a principled application of it. Compassion so understood is troubling, most obviously because it poses a challenge to overall fairness, notice, and consistency. The invocation of compassion to justify law reform is also troubling. It implies that solutions to inequality and other injustices are a matter of charity and mercy, rather than a matter of correcting wrongs and expanding rights.I argue that compassion cannot serve as a reliable indicator of who should prevail in legal debates. I propose instead that compassion’s importance lies in its ability to illuminate for decision-makers what is at stake for the litigant. In this sense, compassion is closely tied to humility: both are reminders of human fallibility and of the limits of individual understanding. More fundamentally, compassion may serve as one of the core values informing the debate about the scope of individual rights and the proper role of government in protecting them.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Dwarf male sterile wheat (DMSW) and corn inducer are potential important germplasm for wheat breeding by recurrent selection and doubled haploid strategies. There is no report yet to achieve the haploid plants from DMSW induced by maize inbred line and especially the corn inducer.ResultsHaploid plants of DMSW were successfully obtained in this study induced by both maize pollens of inducer line and normal inbred line. The efficiencies for wheat embryos formation and plantlets production induced by the two corn lines had no significant difference. All the eleven haploid wheat plants derived from the male sterile material were identified by botanic appearance, cytology, cytogenetics, and molecular markers. They were all haploid based on their guard cell length of 42.78–42.90 μm compared with the diploid control of 71.52 μm, and their chromosome number of 21 compared with the diploid control of 42. In addition, according to anthers, plant height, and molecular markers, the haploid plants were divided into two types. Eight of them showed dwarf, having no anthers, and the special band of Rht10, and the other three plants displayed normal plant height, having anthers, and not containing the special band of Rht10, indicating that they were originated from the MS2/Rht10 and ms2/rht10 female gametes, respectively.ConclusionsMS2/Rht10 haploid plants were successfully obtained in this study by using corn inducer and inbred line, and will be employed as candidate materials for the potential cloning of MS2 dominant male gene.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

What can we learn from a geographical expansion to EU20","This paper presents the static computational game theoretic COMPETES (COmprehensive Market Power in Electricity Transmission and Energy Simulator) model version 2.0. This model can be used to study various policy question regarding economic and environmental effects of a fully opened European electricity market. The COMPETES model can take strategic interaction among electricity producing firms into account. The strategic behaviour of generation companies can be reflected in the conjectures each company holds regarding the supply response of rival companies. These response functions simulate expectations concerning how rivals will change their electricity sales when prices change; these expectations determine the perceived profitability of capacity withholding and other strategies. In addition, COMPETES can solve the market outcome under price and quantity competition. COMPETES can also represent different systems of transmission pricing, among them fixed transmission tariffs, congestion-based pricing of physical transmission, and auction pricing of interface capacity between countries. CO2 costs can be brought in as an exogenous variable. In this paper the COMPETES model is calibrated to twenty European countries, EU20 for short, namely Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK/England & Wales. These countries have been chosen because they are geographically adjoined, their electricity networks are well connected (UCTE, Nord Pool, UK), they are members of the European Union (except for Norway and Switzerland) and data is quite reliable (which would for instance not be the case for the Balkan countries). The level of detail in the COMPETES model is quite extensive. The model contains various characteristics of 7531 power plants in the EU20 area (acquired from the database on World Energy Power Plants). These characteristics comprise among others the generation capacity (of at least 10 MW), production technology, and plant ownership. Availability, energy efficiency, CO2 emissions, and fuel costs per production technology are collected from other sources.

The corresponding marginal instability boundary is closely related to the gas/liquid configuration of the liquid bridge noted as volume ratio. With the increasing volume ratio, the marginal instability boundary consists of the increasing branch and the decreasing branch. A gap region exists between the branches where the critical Marangoni number of the corresponding axisymmetric stationary flow increases drastically. Particularly, a unique axisymmetric oscillatory flow (the critical azimuthal wave number is m=0 ) in the gap region is reported for the liquid bridge of aspect ratio 1.6. Moreover, the energy transfer between the basic state and the disturbance fields of the thermocapillary convection is analyzed at the corresponding critical Marangoni number, which reveals different major sources of the energy transfer for the development of the disturbances in regimes of the increasing branch, the gap region and the decreasing branch, respectively.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We found that for minimalists, the home is a central but porous site for making and staging their values around objects. The home's porous boundary allows minimalists to reinforce their values around objects for others and themselves, but it also necessitates adopting strategies to assert their values when objects---entangled with others' values---move in and out the boundaries of the home. Drawing from our fieldwork, we introduce the concept of the porous boundary. ""Porosity"" impels us to consider the coupling of objects with values as we do boundary practices for the home. A porous boundary perspective, we argue, can open new design spaces in the development of novel technologies for the home.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Going to China for the first time in 2008 to conduct research regarding student music composition and cultural context in an elementary school in the city of Xi'an, I have developed a keen interest in these reforms. With the intent of providing assistance, I conducted the current study. My work, stemming from that initial visit has been with a non-governmental organization (NGO) the China Schools Foundation, whose mission is ""transforming children's futures in remote areas of China with comprehensive, innovative school programs that promote progressive, life-long learning in enriched, healthy and safe environments"" (http://chinaschoolsfoundation.org/). In turn, these efforts are striving to bring music education in China's rural primary schools more in line with the active, child-centered pedagogy that the most recent school reform efforts call for. My focus within this work has been on curriculum development and providing support for rural teachers to begin implementing these curricular ideas, as well as more progressive teaching strategies. Background During three visits to a variety of schools in three Chinese provinces, the traditional approach I have observed is comprised of teacher-directed lessons with students, passively seated in rows of desks, engaged in book-oriented activity, and chanting loudly together the answers to teacher-posed questions. I have not observed students engaged in exploration, manipulation of materials, independent thought, or creativity. Guan and Meng concur, asserting that, ""the traditional delivery mode is teacher-centered, classroom-disciplined and textbook-oriented. It reflects little of inquiry-based, research-based, task-based, exploratory, communicative, cooperative, active-involved /engaged means of instruction"" (2007, p. 582). According to the All-Round Development of Every Student--China's Curriculum Reform of Basic Education in the New Century, an April 2010 document published by the Ministry of Education of the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC): The tendency to overemphasize the instilment of knowledge should be changed, and students' initiative in learning brought into full play.... The undue importance attached to passive learning, rote memorization and mechanical drill should be amended. Students should be urged to take an active part in learning activities, be willing to explore the unknown and diligent in practice. They should also develop their abilities to collect and process information, acquire knowledge, analyze and handle problems, communicate and cooperate with others. (pp. 1-2) I hope that the findings from this study will contribute information to assist teachers in rural primary schools in implementing themes of China's most recent curricular reform efforts. Related Literature A review of literature reveals that several researchers have investigated China's school reform efforts, and examined them from a variety of perspectives. Guan and Meng (2007) examined the motivation, goals, challenges, and progress of reform efforts during the first five years of implementation. Motivation includes the need for creative thinking to keep pace with international competition, liberation from exam-oriented instruction, and impacts of technology and the Internet. A key challenge is providing diverse teaching materials to ensure that the curriculum is adaptable to the economy of local regions, especially the economically depressed and rural areas. Goals include exploring and/or designing curriculum and textbooks that suit local characteristic needs and encouraging students to innovate and act creatively. In order to provide curriculum and instruction with a more close relationship to students' daily lives and modern society, teachers and schools are given flexibility to adopt alternate teaching materials and creative pedagogy that fosters student problem solving, independent thinking, analyzing, communicating, cooperating, and participating. …","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

(2019), models carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion in global fisheries. This is done based on a method using data on fishing effort, presenting results for two sectors: small-scale and industrial fisheries. The selection of these sectors is not motivated in relation to studying fuel use, and it is well-documented that other factors more accurately predict fuel use of fisheries and would constitute a more useful basis for defining sub-sectors, when the goal of the study is to investigate fuel use. Weakly grounded assumptions made in the translation of fishing effort into carbon dioxide emissions (e.g. the engine run time per fishing day for each sector) systematically bias results towards overestimating fuel use of “industrial” vessels, underestimating that of “small-scale”. A sensitivity analysis should have been a minimum requirement for publication. To illustrate how the approach used by Greer et al. (2019) systematically misrepresents the fuel use and emissions of the two sectors, the model is applied to Australian and New Zealand rock lobster trap fisheries and compared to observed fuel use. It is demonstrated how the approach underestimates emissions of small-scale fisheries, while overestimating emissions of industrial fisheries. As global fisheries are dominated by industrial fisheries, the aggregate emission estimate is likely considerably overestimated. Effort-based approaches can be valuable to model fuel use of fisheries in data-poor situations, but should be seen as complementary to estimates based on direct data, which they can also help to validate. Whenever used, they should be based on transparent, science-based data and assumptions.","[{""country"":[""Australia"",""New Zealand""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Three-dimensional- (3D-) printed titanium (Ti) scaffolds could provide patient-specific implants for bone defects. Appropriate load-bearing properties are also required during bone reconstruction, which makes them potential candidates for mandibular bone defect reconstruction implants. However, in clinical practice, the insufficient osteogenesis of the scaffolds needs to be further improved. In this study, we first encapsulated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into Matrigel. Subsequently, the BMSC-containing Matrigels were infiltrated into porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds. The Matrigels in the scaffolds provided a 3D culture environment for the BMSCs, which was important for osteoblast differentiation and new bone formation. Our results showed that rats with a full thickness of critical mandibular defects treated with Matrigel-infiltrated Ti6Al4V scaffolds exhibited better new bone formation than rats with local BMSC injection or Matrigel-treated defects. Our data suggest that Matrigel is able to create a more favorable 3D microenvironment for BMSCs, and Matrigel containing infiltrated BMSCs may be a promising method for enhancing the bone formation properties of 3D-printed Ti6Al4V scaffolds. We suggest that this approach provides an opportunity to further improve the efficiency of stem cell therapy for the treatment of mandibular bone defects.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Paper presented at the meeting of the NTEU, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia, 2015). This commodification of education can manifest in classrooms as reductive pedagogies of uniformity, conformity and knowledge transmission which impact on student satisfaction, attendance and teacher/student rapport. This chapter documents my attempts at resisting these pedagogies in an undergraduate Secondary English curriculum course. I set about building rapport with students by fostering democratic spaces where all were permitted a voice in designing the learning agenda. Students were encouraged to lead discussions, suggest tutorial content/foci and emotionally “check in” with their tutor.

Since the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, United States military doctrine, development work, and humanitarian relief have become increasingly interwoven, often with disastrous results. As defense planners and military strategists have given increased attention to ""stability operations"" and counterinsurgency campaigns across the Global South, development and ""nation-building"" have become central elements of a broader campaign to redirect the futures of ""failed states"" and defeated regimes. Reasoning that the most dangerous strains of political radicalism will emerge and prevail in societies afflicted by poverty, ethnic conflict, and a lack of opportunity, senior figures in the Pentagon and the State Department have come to view development as a crucial weapon in a struggle of indefinite duration. ""What began in late 2001 as a global war on terror,"" Hodge writes, ""was quietly recast as a campaign of armed social work. And in the process, American foreign policy underwent a tectonic shift"" (9).As Hodge explains, in the wake of the September π attacks, U.S. policymakers came to view the challenges of national security through the lens of broad social transformation. Pentagon advisers like Thomas Barnett, for example, advocated that U.S. strategy should be reimagined. In place of the old Cold War divide, Barnett and his colleagues envisioned a world split between a ""functioning core"" of states integrated into the global economy and a ""non-integrating gap"" of states that were outside the channels of international trade, commerce, finance, and growth. In Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Latin America, they argued, the United States would have to prepare to confront terrorist threats, respond to humanitarian crises, intervene in failed states, and engage in prolonged tasks of nation-building. As this view took hold at the highest levels of the Pentagon, it resonated strongly with the conviction of a rising generation of military officers that the United States was unprepared for that challenge. The United States might have an unparalleled ability to fight conventional wars against potential adversaries, but some of the most influential leaders of military policy, including General David Petraeus, believed that the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq pointed toward the need for a greater counterinsurgency capacity. Because the solutions to such conflicts required a deep engagement in the political, economic, and social terrain, advocates called for a new military mission and a greatly expanded, more versatile force to accomplish it. Development, they insisted, would have to become a central part of U.S. defense strategy.1Hodge illustrates the consequences of this approach in convincing detail, and reading his colorful ground-level narratives is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion. Following military officers and USAID workers in the field, Hodge's vivid anecdotes reveal the extent to which a combination of practical failures and theoretical fallacies undermined broad, sweeping ambitions. At the operational level, the immediate task of defeating enemies and winning wars sits uneasily alongside the longer-term goals of sustainable development. ""Building an effective state and a functioning civil society,"" Hodge argues, ""is a process that takes decades, often generations"" (13), yet U.S. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan and Iraq were charged with obtaining rapid results to undermine an insurgency. As a result, questions of democratic accountability were quickly cast aside, a problem that only grew as the military dealt with personnel shortages by contracting projects out to for-profit firms. If the aspirations of local populations for schools, hospitals, roads, and business opportunities frequently ran counter to the immediate desire of U. …","[{""country"":[""Arab World"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Recruiting internationally entails that an increasing number of people exercise their occupation in two or more countries and therefore building a third culture (cf. Kramsch) in intercultural communication contexts as well as reciprocal learning is paramount. Highly skilled professionals and students are increasingly going international, pulled by higher income and life opportunities elsewhere, or pushed by lack of opportunity at home. Globalization and geographical distance also have an effect on expectations of intercultural communication parameters. Transnational mobility of students and skilled migrants is facilitated by technology, globalization, easier transport and communications, and active recruitment by countries that are facing skills shortages. What kind of professional competences are needed; what is the role of language skills; which languages are used, with whom and in what kinds of situations? How do nonverbal skills and accents affect the third culture? A work place third culture needs to incorporate and self-analyze individual attitudes, social skills and emotional competence in order to successfully exist, since work and everyday life contexts are largely shaped by individuals’ readiness and willingness to use and learn languages in a manner needed or required.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Superoxide anion (O2-) production by human eosinophils, an indicator of their activation, was induced by a variety of activators. Several compounds which are known to inhibit protein kinase C (staurosporine, K252a, sphingosine) inhibited O2- production induced by phorbol ester (PMA) but failed to inhibit O2- production induced by IgG coupled to Sepharose beads. Inhibition of O2- production by other agents (plasma-activated zymosan, fMLP, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), was intermediate. By contrast, wortmannin, a compound which has been previously reported to inhibit O2- production in neutrophils via a protein kinase-independent pathway, potently inhibited O2- production in eosinophils which had been activated by IgG and by Platelet-Activating Factor but was virtually inactive against PMA-induced O2- production. Taken together, the results indicate that, as a minimum, there must be two pathways of induction of O2- production in eosinophils. Moreover, the intermediate levels of inhibition in cells which had been activated with serum-activated zymosan, FMLP, and LTB4 suggest that these agents may either be acting via both of these pathways or that yet other pathways may exist.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Extreme positions within the policy debate range from entitlement based on current emission patterns (CEP) to equal-per-capita (EPC) allocations. Convergence (COV) from an initial CEP allocation towards EPC emission rights represents a reconciliation of the two. This paper maintains that the acceptability of alternative entitlement schemes depends on their implications for economic welfare and uses a dynamic multi-region general equlibrium model for a comparative economic asessment of the above allocation rules. We find welfare implications for the various regions to be strongly influenced by changes in the terms of trade. Especially, regions may experience considerable welfare losses even under entitlement schemes which impose no binding emission constraint on them. Among the arrangements examined, COV cum emissions trading stands out for offering the developing countries substantial incentives for participation in the international greenhouse gas abatement effort without imposing excessive burdens on the industrialized countries.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

(2) Risk and resilience: The presence of Group C symptoms after exposure to a disaster or act of terrorism may predict the development of PTSD as well as comorbid diagnoses. (3) Impact of trauma in early life: Persistent increases in CRF concentration are associated with early life trauma and PTSD, and may be reversed with paroxetine treatment. (4) Imaging studies: Intriguing findings in treated and untreated depressed patients may serve as a paradigm of failed brain adaptation to chronic emotional stress and anxiety disorders. (5) Neural circuits and memory: Hippocampal volume appears to be selectively decreased and hippocampal function impaired among PTSD patients. (6) Cognitive behavioral approaches: Prolonged exposure therapy, a readily disseminated treatment modality, is effective in modifying the negative cognitions that are frequent among PTSD patients. In the future, it would be useful to assess the validity of the PTSD construct, elucidate genetic and experiential contributing factors (and their complex interrelationships), clarify the mechanisms of action for different treatments used in PTSD, discover ways to predict which treatments (or treatment combinations) will be successful for a given individual, develop an operational definition of remission in PTSD, and explore ways to disseminate effective evidence-based treatments for this condition.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Building upon the agreement between experimental and theoretical spectra, we demonstrate that water at low relative humidity binds initially to open metal sites and subsequently forms disconnected one-dimensional chains of hydrogen-bonded water molecules bridging between cobalt atoms. With increasing relative humidity, these water chains nucleate pore filling, and water molecules occupy the entire pore interior before the relative humidity reaches 30%. Systematic analysis of rotational and translational dynamics indicates heterogeneity in this pore-confined water, with water molecules displaying variable mobility as a function of distance from the interface.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Employing a cross-national global analysis between the years 1995 and 2011, we find that youth bulges and ICT affect protest activities in a more complicated and nuanced manner than the conventional wisdom suggests. The proliferation of anti-government protests is multiplicatively heightened when the enhanced technological means of protest are fused with the structural and opportunity-based conditions often witnessed in countries with large youth bulges. In contrast, we do not find that either of our variables of interest affects the probability of the outbreak of protests, which is rather explained by more contextual factors. A nuance in our results pertaining to the prevalence of protests suggests that it is the proliferation of technology that is more important than demographic factors. This suggests that those communication mediums, more likely to be used by younger generations, have worked to successfully amplify calls for mobilization even when those cohorts are otherwise smaller in size.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As an application, we analyze global crude oil extraction and quantify the extent of misallocation therein, together with the proportion attributable to market power.

Octopine-producing strains have previously been reported to be ineffective in transforming Brassica. Four actively growing yellow/ green sectors were selected from the embryos on 50 mg/l kanamycin and plants regenerated. Analysis for NPT-II activity in these young plants initially indicated no expression of the bacterial NPT-II gene. The plants were nevertheless grown to maturity, selfed and S1 seed was collected. Three of the S1 plants produced microspores which were from 4 to 20 times more tolerant to kanamycin than the original parent. Southern analysis revealed that one plant (EC-1) had a single site of insertion and the other two plants (EC-2 and EC-6) had two sites of insertion with sequence homology to the bacterial NPT-II gene. Microspores from the EC-2 and EC-6 transgenics produced embryos on approximately five times the level of kanamycin tolerated by microspores from untransformed plants, while the EC-1 transgenic produced microspores with more than 20 times the tolerance to kanamycin. Analysis of S1 progeny of the EC-1 transgenic indicated that 100% of the progeny exhibited the trait through both Southern analysis and by expressing tolerance to kanamycin in microspore-derived embryos.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Neuraxial techniques are not widely used in these populations because of concerns of potential hemorrhagic and/or subsequent neurologic complications. In this article, we review the available literature describing neuraxial techniques in patients with hemophilia, vWD, or ITP with the aim to assist anesthesiologists considering neuraxial techniques in these populations. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: After a systematic Pubmed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE search, we reviewed 30 articles published between January 1, 1975 and October 1, 2008 in which neuraxial techniques were performed in patients with hemophilia, vWD, or ITP to determine the perioperative management and evaluate the frequency of hemorrhagic complications. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We identified 507 neuraxial techniques (482 patients) performed in patients with hemophilia (107 neuraxial techniques, 85 patients), vWD (74 neuraxial techniques, 72 patients), or ITP (326 neuraxial techniques, 325 patients). Among the 507 neuraxial techniques performed, there were 371 lumbar epidural anesthetics, 78 spinal anesthetics, 53 lumbar punctures, 2 combined spinal epidural analgesia, 2 paravertebral blocks, and 1 thoracic epidural anesthetic. Four hundred six neuraxial techniques were placed in the obstetric population, 53 were performed in the emergency room for diagnostic lumbar puncture, 46 were performed for lower limb orthopedic surgery, 1 was performed for postoperative analgesia, and 1 was performed for an obstetric patient undergoing non-obstetric surgery. Factor replacement to normal levels (>0.5 IU mL(-1)) was initiated before block performance, though treatment was not standardized, in 105 of 107 patients with hemophilia and 10 of 74 with vWD. Sixty-four of the 74 patients with vWD had spontaneous normalization of factor levels before block performance. No hemorrhagic complications were reported when the diagnosis of hemophilia or vWD was known before the neuraxial technique. A single case of spinal hematoma (resulting in permanent paraplegia) was identified when the presence of hemophilia was not known before needle insertion and factor replacement had not been given. In all 326 cases of ITP, with or without systemic treatment of platelet transfusion, there were no reports of hemorrhagic complications associated with neuraxial techniques. Among the 326 neuraxial techniques placed in the setting of ITP, 9 patients had platelet counts of <50 x 10(9) L(-1), 19 had a platelet counts of 50-75 x 10(9) L(-1), 204 had a platelet counts of 75-100 x 10(9) L(-1), and 94 had a platelet count more than 100 x 10(9) L(-1) before needle insertion. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: There is a paucity of published data regarding the provision and safety of neuraxial techniques in patients with common bleeding diatheses. The minimum ""safe"" factor levels and platelet count for neuraxial techniques remain undefined in both the obstetric and general populations, and evidence-based recommendations in the setting of hemophilia, vWD, or ITP cannot be offered.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Private Sector Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Yet there is limited understanding of how CES are experienced by individuals with strong generational and genealogical ties to land. Consequently place-based CES are frequently absent from management policies. We use a case study from Hawaiʻi to: 1) outline a process of eliciting place-based and indigenous CES; 2) develop a Hawai‘i-based CES framework that is adaptable to other place-based communities; 3) demonstrate how place-based CES compare/contrast with standard CES; and 4) discuss how this process can enhance resource management and land-use planning. Through interdisciplinary methods drawing on multiple years of research and workshops in two rural Hawaiʻi communities, we highlight concepts not well captured in the existing CES literature including reciprocal relationships between people and place, sense of security, traditional values, and cultural subsistence. Our framework presents CES from a Hawaiian place-based/indigenous point of view by highlighting four main categories: ʻIke (Knowledge), Mana (Spiritual Landscapes), Pilina Kanaka (Social Interactions), and Ola Mau (Physical and Mental Wellbeing). Ultimately, this research provides a methodology to engage place-based communities when identifying CES in ecosystem service assessments.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulatory role of rapamycin (Rap) in Aldo-induced tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Methods: Uninephrectomized, Sprague-Dawley rats were given 1% NaCl (salt) to drink and were randomized to receive treatment for 28 days as follows: vehicle infusion (control), 0.75 μg/h Aldo subcutaneous infusion, or Aldo infusion plus 1 mg/kg/day of Rap by intraperitoneal injection. The effect of Rap on Aldo-induced fibrosis and renal inflammation was investigated using Masson's technique, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. The effects of Rap on the Aldo-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and on TNF-α mRNA expression and secretion in cultured HK-2 cells were investigated by immunofluorescent staining, western blot, qRT-PCR and ELISA. Results: An in vivo study indicated that signaling by the mammalian target of Rap (mTOR) was activated in rats in the Aldo group compared to controls, as indicated by up-regulated expression of p-mTOR and p-S6K. In addition, the inflammatory response increased, as evidenced by increases in inflammatory markers (MCP-1, ICAM-1, F4/80), and the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), as indicated by increased collagen I and fibronectin expression and pro-fibrogenic gene (PAI-1 and TGF-β1) expression. These changes were attenuated by Rap treatment. An in vitro study showed that Rap significantly suppressed the Aldo-induced EMT process and TNF-α mRNA expression and secretion in cultured HK-2 cells. Conclusions: Rap can ameliorate tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis by blocking mTOR signaling. Tubular cells may be a major cell type involved in this physiologic process.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Besides, the greater part of that $1 billion expense goes towards the recuperation of innovative work (R&D) costs for medications that neglect to get endorsement—the benefits from each affirmed drug must take care of the expenses of the considerable number of medications that fizzled. What's more, as opposed to what you may expect, research has become less proficient in the course of the most recent 60 years, in spite of developments in clinical exploration: the quantity of medications affirmed every year has remained moderately static, while the money related assets required for R&D have taken off at a rate well past expansion. Furthermore, the high cost of R&D adds to the high cost or medicines: projections appraise that by 2016, worldwide spending on pharmaceutical advancement will surpass $1.2 trillion annually,3 setting a weight on patients and general worldwide wellbeing resources.4 Meanwhile, pharma organizations are under expanding weight to lessen the cost of medications, on account of the blend of non specific medication rivalry and the expanding hesitance of insurance agencies to repay for costly new treatments unless they are better than less costly options. The descending weight being set on the expense of medications to customers in addition to the upward winding being developed expenses implies that with a specific end goal to stay focused, pharma organizations must discover cost reserve funds.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The two sides have to realign their relations, taking into account new realities and common challenges in the Middle East and Northern Africa region, and the current state of the Middle East Peace Process.

It is well established that such organizations favor in-group members, but under what conditions do they serve out-group communities? To address this question, the authors compare the welfare programs of the predominantly Sunni Muslim Future Movement and the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah in Lebanon. Although they operate under the same institutional rules and economic contexts and boast the largest welfare programs in their respective communities, the Future Movement aims to serve a broader array of beneficiaries, including non-Sunnis, whereas Hezbollah focuses more exclusively on Shiite communities. Based on analyses of an original data set of the spatial locations of welfare agencies, qualitative data from interviews with providers and beneficiaries, and case studies of areas where the two parties established and did not establish welfare agencies, the authors argue that distinct political mobilization strategies—whether electoral or nonelectoral—explain different patterns of service delivery across the two organizations.","[{""country"":[""Lebanon""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The optimal administration method of TXA is still being investigated and safety, efficiency and cost are the three main crucial parameters in achieving the best administration method. We aimed to determine whether combined (oral + topical) use of TXA reduced blood loss and transfusion rates more than single (topical) administration in TKA and whether oral + topical use is as safe and efficient as the IV + topical use, in addition to the main advantage of relatively low cost. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients were randomly assigned to either the topical TXA group or the combined (oral + topical) TXA group. There were no significant differences between the groups in age, body mass index or gender. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each patient were recorded preoperatively and on post-operative days 0, 1, 2 and 3. The post-operative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: There were statistically significant differences between the groups in haemoglobin and haematocrit levels on post-operative days 0, 1, 2 and 3 ( p < 0.05) in favour of the combined group. The post-operative drainage amounts ( p = 0.0001), measured blood loss volume ( p = 0.003) and transfusion rates ( p = 0.03) were lower in the combined (oral + topical) group compared to the topical group. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Of the different methods of TXA administration, the combined use of oral and topical TXA is a safe, efficient and low-cost method in reducing blood loss and transfusion rates after TKA.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Then based on the one-day-ahead forecasted volatility from each model, we calculate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) in each market. The estimated VaR measures from the SV are higher than those obtained from the regime-switching model for all markets and over all horizons. The exception is the Japanese market, where the stochastic volatility model generates low VaR estimates. Comparing those estimates with the unconditional return distribution, the two models generate smaller VaR measures; an evidence of the two models capturing volatility changes in international equity markets. Finally, we backtest each model and find that the performance of both models is the worst for the Canadian stock market, while the regime switching model does poorly for Germany. The results have significant implications for risk management, trading and hedging activities as well as in the pricing of equity derivatives.","[{""country"":[""Canada"",""France"",""Germany"",""Japan"",""Switzerland"",""United Kingdom"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Though Pope’s early amatory poems and his later satire are usually considered in isolation from each other, this essay explores their common preoccupation with the formal erotic, affective, and spiritual experience of rapture and thus demonstrates their dynamic interconnectedness. The result is a new account of Pope’s poetic career, and a new assessment of the relationships between writing and life. Pope came to concentrate on writing satire in the last third of his life, but he was also a translator, a textual scholar, a prodigious letter writer, and in the first major phase of his career, a love poet depicting young women in love, such as Sapho, Eloise, the Unfortunate Lady, and Belinda, often focusing on erotic rapture and death. From about 1728 until his death in 1744, he no longer wrote this kind of poetry, but instead turned his creative energies toward passionate social and political satire, fashioning a poetic persona of the satirist as powerful, wide-ranging, virtually sacred raptor. Hence, Pope’s poetic career moves in a direction from portraying passive subjects, usually young women under the influence of erotic rapture, to exercising his own poetic power of depicting the active force of rapture as satiric predation. The transition from poet of rapturous, death-haunted female love to poet of avenging satirical rapture coincided significantly with his involvement with, and rejection by, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu sometime in the 1720s. Though Pope is largely remembered for his satire, this essay takes a more holistic view of Pope’s life and work, drawing attention to the ways that his translation, scholarship, and especially love poetry contributed directly to his satiric practice later in life. This essay not only brings Pope’s biography to bear on his poetic artistry, but also unites what has often been seen as disparate parts of Pope’s career by seeing him first and foremost as a poet of rapture.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The kynurenine pathway is the main route for the non-protein metabolism of tryptophan. The intermediates of the kynurenine pathway are present at micromolar concentrations in blood and are regulated by inflammatory stimuli. Here we show that GPR35, a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor, functions as a receptor for the kynurenine pathway intermediate kynurenic acid. Kynurenic acid elicits calcium mobilization and inositol phosphate production in a GPR35-dependent manner in the presence of Gqi/o chimeric G proteins. Kynurenic acid stimulates [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding in GPR35-expressing cells, an effect abolished by pertussis toxin treatment. Kynurenic acid also induces the internalization of GPR35. Expression analysis indicates that GPR35 is predominantly detected in immune cells and the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, we show that kynurenic acid inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results suggest unexpected signaling functions for kynurenic acid through GPR35 activation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Interim recommendations were published in February 2013, after almost three and a half years of official law reform deliberations within the Ministry of Justice's Legislative Council, and amendments may be introduced into Parliament by the end of 2014. Most of the interim recommendations track those from a semi-private “Reform Commission” published in 2009, after 260 meetings since 2006 and mainly involving legal academics. Yet, as explained in the first half of this paper, tensions remain in the underlying policy behind these contract law reform proposals. Despite shifts towards giving greater priority to the parties’ agreement, partly influenced by international contract law instruments, some proposals envisage greater protection for weaker parties or leave considerable discretion to judges. Two remarkable changes of government, in 2009 and 2012, have not impacted significantly on this major law reform project in Japan. Far more important than such “macro-politics” has been “micro-politics”. The second half of this paper therefore presents an interest group analysis of the Civil Code reform process. Key academics -- assisted by one legal publisher in particular -- have been able to mobilise a powerful “bureaucratic coalition”, comprising Ministry of Justice officials and judges seconded by the Supreme Court of Japan, despite pockets of opposition from other academics, smaller law firms and certain business sectors. This analysis therefore presents some significant parallels with recent contract law reform initiatives and debates within the European Union. Very different concatenations of interest groups arguably exist in common law jurisdictions such as the US (where major Uniform Commercial Code reforms have foundered) or Australia (where the government commenced in 2012 a consultation into whether and how to reform contract law). Comprehensive reform in those jurisdictions therefore seems unlikely, reducing the potential for the world-wide harmonisation of contract law. A shorter version of this paper is adapted for Maurice Adams and Dirk Thilbaut (eds) The Method and Culture of Comparative Law, Hart, 2014.","[{""country"":[""Japan""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

But recently a strong turnaround has taken place. Macroeconomic stimulus measures in numerous countries have likely contributed to this export recovery. Germany's manufacturers are at the forefront of the resurgence in exports. The mechanical engineering, chemicals, and automotive industries in particular have realized remarkable export surpluses. Germany's current account surplus has risen considerably over the last ten years. As a result, Germany has cemented its position as a net creditor and investor in the international financial market. The challenge now is to link the strength of Germany's exporting industries to the domestic demand. In doing so, long-term and stable growth for the overall economy could be reached. In short, Germany must overcome the dichotomy between its strong export economy and weak domestic demand. One strategy for strengthening domestic demand could be to relax the policy of wage restraint pursued in the years prior to the crisis.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We assessed neuropsychological performance across 4 cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive, and language functions), performed voxelwise and region of interest analyses of gray matter atrophy on T1-weighted MRI, used fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images to automatically quantify white matter hyperintensity volumes, and assessed T2*-weighted images to identify microbleeds. Differences in cognitive domain scores, atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities between ε2 carriers, ε3 homozygotes, and ε4 carriers were assessed using analysis of variance analyses, and Pearson χ2 tests were used to examine differences in prevalence of microbleeds. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We found that ε2 carriers performed worse on nonmemory domains compared to both ε3 homozygotes and ε4 carriers but better on memory compared to ε4 carriers. Voxelwise T1-weighted MRI analyses showed asymmetric (left > right) temporoparietal-predominant atrophy with subtly less involvement of medial-temporal structures in ε2 carriers compared to ε4 carriers. Finally, ε2 carriers had larger total white matter hyperintensity volumes compared to ε4 carriers (mean 10.4 vs 7.3 mL) and a higher prevalence of microbleeds compared to ε3 homozygotes (37.5% vs 18.3%). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: APOEε2 carriers who develop Alzheimer disease despite carrying the protective allele display a nonamnestic clinical phenotype with more severe small vessel disease.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To understand the phenomenon from a politico-economic perspective, we embed the fiscal theory of the price level into an overlapping-generations model. In the model, successive short-lived governments choose income tax rates and bond issues considering the political influence of existing generations and the policy response of future governments. The model sheds new light on the traditional debate about the burden of national debt. Because of price adjustments, the accumulation of government debt does not become a burden on future generations. Our analysis reveals that the effects of aging depend on its causes. Aging is deflationary when caused by an increase in longevity but inflationary when caused by a decline in birth rate. Numerical simulation shows that aging over the past 40 years in Japan generated deflation of about 0.6 percentage points annually.","[{""country"":[""Japan""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, knowledge of the cellular transition from BAT to white adipose tissue (WAT) and the potential role of lncRNAs in goat adipose tissue remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the transformation from BAT to WAT using histological and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene analyses. Brown adipose tissue mainly existed within the goat perirenal fat at 1 day and there was obviously a transition from BAT to WAT from 1 day to 1 year. The RNA libraries constructed from the perirenal adipose tissues of 1 day, 30 days, and 1 year goats were sequenced. A total number of 21,232 lncRNAs from perirenal fat were identified, including 5393 intronic-lncRNAs and 3546 antisense-lncRNAs. Furthermore, a total of 548 differentially expressed lncRNAs were detected across three stages (fold change ≥ 2.0, false discovery rate (FDR) 0.95 or r < −0.95). In addition, Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses showed that the targeted genes were involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid elongation and metabolism, the citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. The present study provides a comprehensive catalog of lncRNAs involved in the transformation from BAT to WAT and provides insight into understanding the role of lncRNAs in goat brown adipogenesis.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Empirical research on the relation between birth order and intelligence has convincingly documented that performances on psychometric intelligence tests decline slightly from firstborns to later-borns. By contrast, the search for birth-order effects on personality has not yet resulted in conclusive findings. We used data from three large national panels from the United States (n = 5,240), Great Britain (n = 4,489), and Germany (n = 10,457) to resolve this open research question. This database allowed us to identify even very small effects of birth order on personality with sufficiently high statistical power and to investigate whether effects emerge across different samples. We furthermore used two different analytical strategies by comparing siblings with different birth-order positions (i) within the same family (within-family design) and (ii) between different families (between-family design). In our analyses, we confirmed the expected birth-order effect on intelligence. We also observed a significant decline of a 10th of a SD in self-reported intellect with increasing birth-order position, and this effect persisted after controlling for objectively measured intelligence. Most important, however, we consistently found no birth-order effects on extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or imagination. On the basis of the high statistical power and the consistent results across samples and analytical designs, we must conclude that birth order does not have a lasting effect on broad personality traits outside of the intellectual domain.","[{""country"":[""Euro area"",""Germany"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

CNV distribution was significantly skewed toward larger gene-disrupting events in RHD cases compared to 4,733 ethnicity-matched controls (p = 4.8 × 10(-11)). This excess was attributable to known and novel (i.e., not present in any database or in the literature) genomic disorders. All together, 55/522 (10.5%) RHD cases harbored 34 distinct known genomic disorders, which were detected in only 0.2% of 13,839 population controls (p = 1.2 × 10(-58)). Another 32 (6.1%) RHD cases harbored large gene-disrupting CNVs that were absent from or extremely rare in the 13,839 population controls, identifying 38 potential novel or rare genomic disorders for this trait. Deletions at the HNF1B locus and the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial locus were most frequent. However, the majority of disorders were detected in a single individual. Genomic disorders were detected in 22.5% of individuals with multiple malformations and 14.5% of individuals with isolated urinary-tract defects; 14 individuals harbored two or more diagnostic or rare CNVs. Strikingly, the majority of the known CNV disorders detected in the RHD cohort have previous associations with developmental delay or neuropsychiatric diseases. Up to 16.6% of individuals with kidney malformations had a molecular diagnosis attributable to a copy-number disorder, suggesting kidney malformations as a sentinel manifestation of pathogenic genomic imbalances. A search for pathogenic CNVs should be considered in this population for the diagnosis of their specific genomic disorders and for the evaluation of the potential for developmental delay.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

My reading of Ethics follows a range of feminist thinkers that have engaged with Spinoza’s ‘ethics of joy’ in education and beyond. The article draws on extensive archival work with personal auto/biographical documents and public essays of women workers/educators/writers in Paris and New York that span the period between 1830 and 1950.

Paradoxically, lymphocytes lacking FADD or casp8 fail to undergo normal clonal expansion following antigen receptor cross-linking and succumb to caspase-independent cell death upon activation. Here we show that T cells lacking FADD or casp8 activity are subject to hyperactive autophagic signaling and subvert a cellular survival mechanism into a potent death process. T cell autophagy, enhanced by mitogenic signaling, recruits casp8 through interaction with FADD:Atg5-Atg12 complexes. Inhibition of autophagic signaling with 3-methyladenine, dominant-negative Vps34, or Atg7 shRNA rescued T cells expressing a dominant-negative FADD protein. The necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1, which blocks receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP kinase 1), also completely rescued T cells lacking FADD or casp8 activity. Thus, while autophagy is necessary for rapid T cell proliferation, our findings suggest that FADD and casp8 form a feedback loop to limit autophagy and prevent this salvage pathway from inducing RIPK1-dependent necroptotic cell death. Thus, linkage of FADD and casp8 to autophagic signaling intermediates is essential for rapid T cell clonal expansion and may normally serve to promote caspase-dependent apoptosis under hyperautophagic conditions, thereby averting necrosis and inflammation in vivo.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The images we are primarily concerned with were published between 1909 and 1919, the decade leading up to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Much work has been done on visual representations of women in suffrage postcards and cartoons more generally. Broadly speaking, scholars discuss how the strictures of white heteronormative femininity and the expectations of motherhood were important tropes in suffrage imagery. Much less, however, has been said about how depictions of masculinity and fatherhood operated in suffrage postcards. The preliminary results from this digital humanities approach have revealed the degree to which representations of fatherhood and masculinity were central to the construction of both the proand anti-suffrage debate. As we move forward, we will consider the tension between men and women, motherhood and fatherhood, the family, and the family of the nation that was central to suffrage postcards. Since our project is interdisciplinary in scope, crossing both history and literary studies, we consider how these images influenced and interacted both with political discourse and the women’s writing of the period.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

One class of agents that is currently used to target EGFR in the treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC) is the monoclonal antibodies.

In Spain, for years many players have suffered abuse and insults, although it is black and ethnic minority players who receive the most harassment.

Sixty-seven Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates, obtained from implantable medical devices, were investigated. Overall, 70% of the strains were positive for ica operon genes, 85% possessed atlE, and 46% contained aap. In 89% of the population, the Congo red agar test confirmed the correlation between the presence of ica genes and slime expression. Almost all of the strains could be classified as biofilm producers by both the crystal violet assay and microscopy. The bacterial population studied showed a very high frequency of strains positive for mecA as well as for the IS256 element. Although well-structured biofilms have been previously observed only in those strains possessing genes belonging to the ica operon, this study demonstrates that strains lacking specific biofilm-formation determinants can be isolated from catheters and can form a biofilm in vitro. Hence, different and yet-to-be identified factors may work together in the formation and organization of complex staphylococcal microbial communities and sustain infections associated with implanted medical devices.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Instead of minimum price policy, input costs need to be reduced to compete in the international markets as higher domestic prices leave a country internationally uncompetitive and increase the costs to the economy. The objective of this study was to find suitable price policy reforms. Extensive analysis revealed that higher cost of production is the main reason for higher domestic prices. Therefore, the study proposes that controlling and reducing input costs will benefit the farmers as well as the economy. Subsidies on inputs, especially fertilizers, should be given by the government as this will reduce the cost of production significantly. Moreover, reduced input cost for wheat will be the appropriate policy intervention which will lead to achieve international competitiveness. Thus, the policy recommendation on the basis of the analysis carried out in the previous sections is that subsidy should be given on inputs of wheat, especially fertilizers, to reduce the cost of production, as reduction in the production cost will proportionately reduce the support price.","[{""country"":[""Pakistan""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It argues that while Indian state’s control over land, resources and contracts gives it an overwhelming privilege over the market, it concurrently provides strategic avenues for ‘state capture’ by certain business houses, which at various historical junctures have gained immensely through extension of such privileges and ‘patronage,’ a trend that continues unabated, perhaps even more blatantly in a liberalising India. Yet, such ‘state capture’ remains partial and tenuous as the quest for social-economic justice continues to weigh heavily on the market forces. Simultaneously, the democratic and federal polity lends Indian state a fair degree of authority over the market forces. More pertinently, in the imagination of the nation, the state was given and continues to enjoy a privileged and exalted status in general and more particularly vis-a-vis the market forces even when it cedes to and is compromised by the latter in numerous ways. The Indian case thus offers a vital lens to revisit some of the extant theoretical pivots of state-market relationship.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It deals with the question of whether it is possible to envisage instances of concertation that deflect conflict. Based mostly on French experience with public inquiries on transport infrastructure, it discusses the relevance and applicability of the sociology of collective action, as well as theories of deliberative democracy. The paper's main argument is that concertation does not occur in a vacuum but is instead structured by power relations. It is, therefore, first and foremost an opportunity to express dissatisfaction and frustration. At the same time, public debate represents—perhaps for the same reason—an opportunity to criticize forms of social domination. It thus may give rise to citizen mobilization rather than help contain it, as is often naively expected by its promoters within the public policy administration. Conflict is thus always the actual subject of public debate.","[{""country"":[""France""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Maasai culture and its accompanying traditions compose one of the most well-studied anthropological systems in the world. Currently, Maasai culture and tradition face more challenges than ever before. Through a series of interviews with various constituents of the Amboseli community, we sought to discover which traditions the Maasai continued to find important, what were the most formidable threads to those traditions, and how the Maasai were responding to those threats. Community members identified four primary traditions that continue to be important: social connectedness, dress and ornaments, connection with wildlife and nature, and the practice of Moranism. Threats to these traditions include increased the presence of Westerners, tourists, and conservationists; climate change and increased incidence of drought; changing land tenure systems; and the introduction of formal education among younger generations. Maasai community members have responded to these threats by keeping, discarding, or evolving the tradition based on its importance to them. Based on these findings, we detail potential strategies for the maintenance of those traditions which are currently evolving: Moranism and pastoralism. These recommendations will inform Maasai community members about the scope of solutions they currently face, as well as providing insight into more innovative solutions that could be implemented in the future.","[{""country"":[""Africa""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The SJF is contained within the major deliverable of the project, which is A Good Practice Guide for Safeguarding Student Learning Engagement (Nelson & Creagh, 2013) and is focused on good practice for activities that monitor student learning engagement and identify students at risk of disengaging in their first year. Examination of the social justice literature and its application to the higher education sector produced a set of five principles: Self-determination, Rights, Access, Equity and Participation. Each principle was defined and elucidated by a rationale and implications for practice, thus completing the SJF. The framework: reflects the notions of equity and social justice; provides a strategic approach for safeguarding engagement activities; and is supported by a suite of resources for practice and practitioners. The aim of this poster session is to engage in conversations about the SJF and how it might be applied to other types of student engagement activities critical to the first year of university life, such as orientation and transition programs, teamwork activities, peer programs and other academic support initiatives.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The project, implemented by Andrew Breitenberg, an American artist currently living in South Africa, together with a group of Dutch volunteers, was called These three remain. By investigating how the project negotiates, or fails to negotiate, sustainable social change in practice, we construe possible reasons for the project's outcomes with the aim of improving the viability of social design practice as a change agent in social design projects throughout South Africa. In this case study, aspects of South African social design practice are discussed, without skirting around issues that may be hard for designers to deal with when confronted with the reality of social politics in South Africa.

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The previous editor, Professor David Swanson of the University of California at Riverside, as well as the editor before him, Professor Elwood Carlson of Florida State University, have helped to develop PRPR into a prominent international journal for population research. The journal is affiliated with a regional professional association in the United States, the Southern Demographic Association (SDA), but its authors, reviewers, editorial board, and readers represent all regions of the world. The publisher, Springer, and particularly Evelien Bakker and Marielle Klijn, have also made outstanding contributions to the growing reputation of the journal. Population Research and Policy Review encourages submissions under a very comprehensive definition of population research and a wide range of data and methodologies. It is expected that submissions will have an explicit connection with population policy at some level. It is preferred, although not necessary, that authors connect with research topics that have previously appeared in this journal. Thanks to the Editorial Manager software used by our publisher, the submission and review process is now entirely online. Soon after the online submission of a paper to the website, two potential reviewers are contacted. The review process is entirely blind, in the sense that reviewers do not know the names or affiliations of authors, and authors do not know the names or affiliations of reviewers. Potential reviewers sometimes take a long time simply to acknowledge the email inviting them to do a review, and after agreeing to do a review they sometimes take a long time to provide it; sometimes they never do so. Most delays arise from these sources. Authors can monitor the progress of their paper on the website.

That competition avoided World War III in part because decades of arms control negotiations created a mutual understanding that allowed U.S.-Soviet competition to proceed without armed conflict. The first half of the 21st century will be dominated by the relationship between the United States and China. That relationship is likely to contain elements of both cooperation and competition. Territorial disputes such as those over Taiwan and the South China Sea will be an important feature of this competition, but both are traditional disputes, and traditional solutions suggest themselves. A more difficult set of issues relates to U.S.-Chinese competition and cooperation in three domains in which real strategic harm can be inflicted in the current era: nuclear, space, and cyber. Just as a clearer understanding of the fundamental principles of nuclear deterrence maintained adequate stability during the Cold War, a clearer understanding of the characteristics of these three domains can provide the underpinnings of strategic stability between the United States and China in the decades ahead. That is what this book is about. David Gompert and Phillip Saunders assess the prospect of U.S.-Chinese competition in these domains and develop three related analytic findings upon which their recommendations are built. The first is that in each domain, the offense is dominant. The second is that each side will be highly vulnerable to a strike from the other side. And the third is that the retaliating side will still be able to do unacceptable damage to the initiating party. Therefore, the authors make an important recommendation: that the United States propose a comprehensive approach based on mutual restraint whereby it and China can mitigate their growing strategic vulnerabilities.","[{""country"":[""China"",""Russian Federation"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Learning about the stochastic nature of reassurances as well as making inferential statements about the influence of covariates such as patient response and time spent on previous reassurances are of particular importance. We fit Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to reassurance type from multiple time series of clinicians’ reassurances, decoded from audio files of review consultations between patients with breast cancer and their therapeutic radiographer. Assuming a latent state process driving the observations process, HMMs naturally accommodate serial dependence in the data. Extensions to the baseline model such as including covariates as well as allowing for fixed effects for the different clinicians are straightforward to implement. We found that clinicians undergo different states, in which they are more or less inclined to provide a particular type of reassurance. The states are very persistent, however switches occasionally occur. The lengthier the previous reassurance, the more likely the clinician is to stay in the current state. HMMs prove to be a valuable tool and provide important insights for practitioners. Trial Registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02599506.

It uses Joan Acker's theory of gendered organizations operating through four dimensions: the gendered division of labour, gendered interaction, gendered symbols and gendered interpretations of one's position in the organization. The article combines this approach with theories of hidden discrimination. The key theoretical aim is to contribute to gendered organizational theory by examining the ways in which hidden discrimination and the gendered organization work together. This generates detailed and differentiated knowledge about the mechanisms of hidden discrimination that produce gender inequalities in the department. The findings presented in this article point to the role of gendered division of labour and the lack of information about departmental practices. PhD supervision by men is a particularly strong structural barrier for women because of the gendered nature of interaction in supervision and the difficulties that female PhD students have in a male-dominated environment. The article further contributes to debates on gendered organizations by focusing upon the gendered symbols of expertise in political science. These symbols reproduce the man as the political scientist norm and result in women interpreting their own position as marginal or as outsiders.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The Austrian School of Economics? diagnosis of the defects in the functioning and practice of economics are more or less as the following. It thinks that the creation of money out of thin air and lowering interest rate for lending that money are the primary causes of inflation and boom-bust cycle, both of which are detrimental to the economy. Besides, this School?s opinion is that the government in connivance with the central bank adopts such policies like bailing out and spending excessively. It increases the government debt unnecessarily. To repay this debt, the government increases tax which in turn reduces the spending capacity of the tax-payers. Thus, according to this School, both the monetary policy of the central bank and the fiscal policy of the government (government intervention in the economics and financial system) cause unnatural and harmful effects on the overall economic condition of a nation.To ameliorate these defects, the Austrian School of Economics prescribes the following remedies. This School thinks, as money is not anchored to any commodity, so the central bank and government are in a position to increase the money supply without limit; this increase in money supply causes inflation which in turn leads to more demand for money supply. To meet this new demand for money the central bank creates and supplies more amount of money and lower the interest rate than the natural rate of interest. This increase in money-supply, again, causes inflation and renewed demand for extra money; again extra supply of money, again inflation increases. Thus the vicious circle of money supply and inflation leads to boom and bust. Therefore, this School suggests that money-creation should be anchored to some commodity so that creation of money cannot be unlimited. This School thinks that if money-creation is based on the standard of gold and silver then there will be no fiat money or easy money and inflation will be controlled and there will be little chance of occurring boom-bust cycle. There other suggestion is that the central bank should be dissolved or abolished and there should not be any central authority to impose any uniform monetary policy on the economy. In every area there will be banks independent of any superior authority; the monetary policy and the interest rates will be formulated by the market forces of the concerned area where the authority of a bank will be operative. This School prescribes unfettered market system. This School also suggests that government should not interfere into the economic and financial activities neither in the positive way like bailing out any falling bank or corporate nor by enforcing any law that may control the economy in any way. This School also suggests that government should minimize its expenditure even by curtailing its spending for what is considered as public works. This School is also of the opinion that government should lower its tax-rate or abolish tax altogether.According to the Austrian School of Economics, in the present economics system, the central bank creates fiat money or debt money to give loans and thus increases the supply of money. The Austrian School suggests that if money creation is followed strictly with the commodity (gold) standard then loan can be given only by using the savings and there will be no possibility of increase in the money-supply as existing money that is saved will be used for lending purposes. Therefore, no question of inflation due to increase in money-supply (fiat money that is created out of nothing) will arise.It will be simply impossible to deal with all the prescriptions and suggestions of the Austrian School in this paper and to suggest how those prescriptions may be developed further so as to make them function flawless or more correctly. It also becomes imperative to explain in which way the diagnosis and prescriptions of other Schools are wrong. It seems me that the differences of opinion among these Schools are mostly due to the absence of any universally accepted definition and function of money and how money should be oriented to suit our purpose of achieving a sustainable economic growth unhampered by occasional visit of boom-bust cycles. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to suggest that while it is correct that money should be anchored to commodity, yet more thoughts are necessary as to how the growing demand for money with the expanding monetary activities could be met. If we can arrive at a correct definition of money and how we can orient the money to function in the way to eliminate those harmful effects that, the Austrian School of Economics has shown, occur in the present economic system. Therefore, primary aim of this paper is to examine how far the assertion that money must be any commodity is workable in the economic and financial systems of a country.","[{""country"":[""Austria""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, there is great variability in the reported reliability of scores on the NPI. This study meta-analyzes coefficient alpha for scores on the NPI and its sub-scales (e.g. entitlement) with transformed alphas weighted by the inverse of the variance of alpha. Three coders evaluated 1213 individual studies for possible inclusion and determined that 1122 independent samples were suitable for coding on 12 different characteristics of the sample, scale, and study. A fourth author cross-coded 15 percent of these samples resulting in 85 percent overall agreement. In the independent samples, comprised of 195,038 self-reports, the expected population coefficient alpha for the NPI was .82. The population value for alpha on the various sub-scales ranged from .48 for narcissistic self-sufficiency to .76 for narcissistic leadership/authority. Because significant heterogeneity existed in coded study alphas for the overall NPI, moderator tests and an explanatory model were also conducted and reported. It was found that longer scales, the use of a Likert response scale as opposed to the original forced choice response format, higher mean scores and larger standard deviations on the scale, as well as the use of samples with a larger percentage of female respondents were all positively related to the expected population alpha for scores on the overall NPI. These results will likely aid researchers who are concerned with the reliability of scores on the NPI in their research on non-clinical subjects.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, this evolutionary process does not necessarily diminish the fact that, since the advent of the Westphalian state, sovereignty has been used as a shield and sword to justify states’ policies and actions. It is argued in this policy brief that the weakening of state sovereignty and the prominence and institutionalisation of people’s sovereignty will be a welcome development, in terms of governance fundamentals, on the African political and socio-economic development scene. Indeed, it may be a key to addressing Africa’s chronic political, socio-economic and human development challenges.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Woody lianas thrive in degraded and secondary forests, due to their competitive advantage over trees in these habitats. Lianas compete both directly and indirectly with trees, increasing tree mortality and turnover. Despite our growing understanding of liana-tree dynamics, we lack detailed knowledge of the assemblage-level responses of lianas themselves to fragmentation, particularly in evergreen tropical forests. We examine the responses of both sapling and mature liana communities to landscape-scale forest insularization induced by a mega hydroelectric dam in the Brazilian Amazon. Detailed field inventories were conducted on islands created during reservoir filling, and in nearby mainland continuous forest. We assess the relative importance of variables associated with habitat fragmentation such as area, isolation, surrounding forest cover, fire and wind disturbance, on liana community attributes including abundance, basal area, diversity, and composition. We also explore patterns of liana dominance relative to tree saplings and adults ≥10 cm diameter at breast height. We find that 1) liana community composition remains remarkably similar across mainland continuous forest and islands, regardless of extreme area- and edge- effects and the loss of vertebrate dispersers in the latter; and 2) lianas are increasing in dominance relative to trees in the sapling layer in the most degraded islands, with both the amount of forest cover surrounding islands and fire disturbance history predicting liana dominance. Our data suggest that liana communities persist intact in isolated forests, regardless of extreme area- and edge-effects; while in contrast, tree communities simultaneously show evidence of increased turnover and supressed recruitment. These processes may lead to lianas becoming a dominant component of this dam-induced fragmented landscape in the future, due to their competitive advantage over trees in degraded forest habitats. Additional loss of tree biomass and diversity brought about through competition with lianas, and the concurrent loss of carbon storage, should be accounted for in impact assessments of future dam development.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Recently, the complete crystal structure of FDC (based on the co-expression of the A. niger fdc1 gene in E. coli with the associated ubix gene from E. coli) at high resolution was reported. Herein, the detailed catalytic non-oxidative decarboxylation mechanism of FDC has been investigated by a combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach. Calculation results indicate that, after the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the substrate and cofactor, the carboxylic group can readily split off from the adduct, and the overall energy barrier of the whole catalytic reaction is 23.5 kcal mol-1. According to the energy barrier analysis, the protonation step is rate-limiting. The conserved protonated Glu282 is suggested to be the proton donor through a ""water bridge"". Besides, two cases, that is, the generated CO2 escapes from the active site or remains in the active site, were considered. It was found that the prolonged leaving of CO2 can facilitate the protonation of the intermediate. In particular, our calculations shed light on the detailed function of both cofactors prFMNiminium and prFMNketamine in the decarboxylation step. The cofactor prFMNiminium is the catalytically relevant species compared with prFMNketamine.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

If an economy constraint C penalizes a derivation/representation in language A, it will also do so in language B. This paper presents a type of crosslinguistic variation that casts serious doubts on this assumption, namely the distribution of resumptive relatives vis-a-vis gap relatives. It is shown that while resumption is a last resort in languages like Zurich German, i.e. occurring only when gap relatives are barred, it can be an optional strategy in languages like Hebrew/Irish, thus occurring in the same environment as gap relatives. For the first type of language this implies that gap and resumptive relatives are in the same reference set and compete and that gap relatives block resumptive relatives. Gap relatives are shown to involve movement while resumptive relatives are derived by base-generation in Zurich German. Since a different set of lexical items is involved in the two derivations the reference set must be based on identical LFs rather than identical numerations. However, once this is established it is surprising that no blocking obtains in the second group of languages. Several options to solve this problem will be evaluated. It will be shown that the variation is best modeled by means of different rankings of interacting and violable constraints. The ban against resumption will be subsumed under a general constraint that penalizes External Merge. The paper is organized as follows: section one introduces basic facts about relativization in Zurich German. Section two explains the distribution of resumptives in Zurich German relatives. Section three discusses possible analyses of resumption under the assumption that gap and resumptive relatives are based on the same numeration. Section four reviews possible economy constraints that block resumption. Section five addresses pseudo-optionality. Section six shows that cross-linguistic variation requires a different interpretation of economy constraints, and section seven concludes the paper. 1","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Monetary history reveals the fact that folly has frequently been paramount; for it describes many fateful mistakes. --Knut Wicksell The Federal Reserve System came into existence 100 years ago after lengthy debate and discussion. It seems timely to look back on its founding, its history and development, and to consider its major successes and failures. This article looks at that history and discusses how the past is reflected in the present. The Founding of the Fed The new institution had little scope for discretionary policy actions. None of the parties discussing the proposed Federal Reserve Act of 1913 doubted that it would continue to follow a monetary rule--the international gold standard. Actions and initiatives remained greatly restricted by the Act. Monetary, credit, and interest rate actions consisted principally of setting discount rates on commercial paper and banker's acceptances. Rates influenced the amount of discounting, but the initiative for discounting remained with the banks. The Federal Reserve could purchase or sell bankers' acceptances on its own initiative, but individual Reserve Banks could decide whether to participate. Agreement about economic issues included more than the gold standard. A series of financial disturbances in the 1890s and 1907 convinced most of Congress, the Wilson administration, and the informed public that the social cost of bank failures could be greatly reduced by creating a lender of last resort (LOLR) with power to lend on acceptable collateral in a financial crisis. The gain came from protecting the payments system, not, as now, protecting banks. Agreement on another vital economic issue concerned the financing of government borrowing. The 1913 Act prohibited any direct loans to the Treasury. The authors understood, perhaps better than their modern counterparts, that financing government debt was likely to bring inflation. Many economists act as if monetary policy is entirely an economic issue. Many articles analyze optimal economic policy. These articles neglect that the Federal Reserve is governed by political as well as economic concerns. That has been true since the founding, and it remains true, perhaps even truer now that discretionary actions have replaced the very restricted rules in the original design. Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution assigns the monetary power to Congress. The Federal Reserve is its agent. That makes political influence inescapable. Despite words about independence, it takes a very strong leader to remain independent. As former Fed chairman William McChesney Martin Jr. often remarked: ""The Federal Reserve is independent within government, not independent of government"" (Meltzer 2003: 713). That is not a very restrictive definition of independence. The gold standard and discounting did not delay the 1913 legislation. The agreements that were difficult to reach were political issues. (1) Two issues stand out: (1) the issue of who would control the new agency--the Board in Washington or the 12 Reserve Banks spread across the country. And (2) where would the Reserve Banks be situated? The law assigned the second issue to a three-person board. President Wilson, a former political science professor, proposed a compromise. The Reserve Banks would be semi-autonomous, with directors drawn from their region, with power to approve or dissent from purchases and authorized to set regional discount rates with Board approval. The Board in Washington had a supervisory role. The compromise satisfied the Western and Southern populists who thought that the Board would keep New York from setting interest rates at levels that would squeeze farmers and merchants. The large financial firms in New York preferred a structure like the Bank of England with no government participation. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Performances of popular culture were already used during the struggle for independence, and such practice was in wide use during the regime of Dr Banda, the first president of Malawi, and it has continued also after his resignation in the 1990s. The songs composed for praising the power, wisdom and excellency of the Malawi Congress Party, and particularly of its leader, Dr. Banda, were typically performed by female dancers, who used allegedly traditional modes of expression in communicating the political message. During the time of the multi-party government the practice seems to continue to be the same. The songs earlier sung in praise of Banda were later sung for Bakili Muluzi, his successor in power, and songs for mocking the previous president and his party were composed and performed during the political campaigns. However, instead of using forms of popular culture to support one party for the disadvantage of the others, there would be a need in Malawi to use such art forms for creating a 'common' political culture.

Gender differences in emotion processing are a common finding in functional neuroimaging studies, and have been documented in behavioral studies of humor, but have received limited attention in functional neuroimaging studies on humor. Using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrasts with high-field (3T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMR) we investigated 29 healthy subjects (14 female, 15 male) during the processing of humorous cartoons. In women, the ventral system implicated in detection and appraisal of emotion was activated, including amygdala, insula, and Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). Men showed activation in both the ventral and dorsal processing systems. The results indicate that women process humor though limbic reactivity, involving appraisal of its emotional features, while men apply more evaluative, executive resources to humor processing.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Intended to be a practical tool to support the future provisions of people with serious unmet needs, whether physical, social, economic, educational, or political. It contains a dozen tools, examples of practice and other resources to evaluate multiple and concurrent systems of complex situations. It was also developed in response to meeting the demand for robust and appropriate systemic methodology, tools, strategies, and training for practitioners working with the Agenda 2030, Sustainable Development Goals in the international development sector. The Guidance was published mid 2017 but testing and refining the draft methodology commenced in late 2016 with the UN Women corporate evaluation of the global participation of women in leadership and politics. In this presentation Anne Stephens will introduce both the ISE Guidance and UN Evaluation Expert Shravanti Reddy (via skype) to discuss the benefits and learnings of using this approach to high-level corporate evaluation. They will also discuss how the ISE contributes to building knowledge and practice of evaluation across a range of complex situations and the capacity development required to implement the ISE Guide in your setting.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The degree to which this occurs—the incidence of current expected government payments on current rent—is relevant for policy in two ways. First, it provides information about the distribution of payment benefits vis-a-vis landowners and farmers. For example, if payment benefits are intended for farmers rather than landowners, and the incidence is high, a share of the benefits may miss their target.1 Because about 60% of U.S. farmland is owned by nonoperators, there is a real potential for this kind of misallocation (Hopkins, Morehart, and Bohman). Second, the level of incidence may reflect the degree to which government programs that give rise to these payments alter production. A high incidence may reflect a low supply response to a government program, because a small share of the payments is dissipated via lower output prices (due to greater quantities supplied) and higher prices for input factors besides land (due to greater quantities demanded). A low incidence may reflect a large supply response and a greater appropriation of payment benefits to commodity consumers and suppliers of other input factors, such as machinery and human capital.

The mean TSH level was 2.16 mIU/L, with a reference interval of 0.59 to 7.03 mIU/L (men 2.09 mIU/L, women 2.24 mIU/L, P<0.001). A U-shaped association was found between serum TSH levels and age. The mean fT₄ level was 1.25 ng/dL, and its reference interval was 0.92 to 1.60 ng/dL (men 1.29 ng/dL, women 1.20 ng/dL, P<0.0001). Serum fT₄ levels decreased with age (P for trend <0.0001). Serum thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) was detected in 7.30% of participants (men 4.33%, women 10.62%). TPOAb titers tended to increase with age, and were higher in women than in men. The median UIC was 294 μg/L, and UIC showed a U-shaped relationship with age. According to the World Health Organization recommendations, only 23% of participants were in the adequate range of iodine intake, while 65% were in the above requirements or excessive, and 12% in insufficient.

Uniform systems can give us better insights into energy efficiency indicators. In this paper, the multiplicative Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition technique is introduced and applied in an analysis of energy use in Iran. The aim of the following investigation is to find out what causes the changes in energy use in Irans industrial and transportation sectors. The data of this work consist of final energy use over the 2001-2006 periods from annual energy balance sheets and sectorial values added from Input- Output tables over the same years. The obtained results show that energy consumption changes are determined by the activity levels. Next among the significant energy consumption determinants are structural and energy intensity impacts.","[{""country"":[""Iran, Islamic Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Both Fascism and the political forces of the new Italy employed Garibaldi in an attempt to gain public support and to bolster their claims to historical legitimacy. While regime changes are usually accompanied by a radical dismantling of mythical and ritualistic underpinnings of the former regime's legitimacy, the Italian transition from Fascism to democracy represented a remarkable case of symbolic and historical-semantic continuity. The article argues that Fascism elaborated upon the figure on Garibaldi in a way that made alternative future readings and interpretations inherently possible, creating a legacy of polysemic, ambivalent and open-ended memory politics.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Three variables are utilized to capture separate exchange rate effects. The bilateral exchange rate to the US$ captures the value of local currency (a higher value implies a cheaper currency and attracts FDI). Changes in real effective exchange rate index (REER) proxy for expected changes in the exchange rate: an increasing (decreasing) REER is interpreted as devaluation (appreciation) being expected, so that FDI is postponed (encouraged). The transitory component of bilateral exchange rates is a proxy for volatility of local currency, which discourages FDI. The results support the ‘Chakrabarti and Scholnick’ hypothesis that, ceteris paribus, there is a negative relationship between the expectation of local currency depreciation and FDI inflows. Cheaper local currency (devaluation) attracts FDI as volatile exchange rates discourage FDI.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Several essential elements must be precisely assembled during development to confer the unique structure and function of the mechanotransduction apparatus. Here we investigated the functional development of the transduction complex in outer hair cells along the length of mouse cochlea acutely excised between embryonic day 17 (E17) and postnatal day 8 (P8). We charted development of the stereociliary bundle using scanning electron microscopy; FM1-43 uptake, which permeates hair cell transduction channels, mechanotransduction currents evoked by rapid hair bundle deflections, and mRNA expression of possible components of the transduction complex. We demonstrated that uptake of FM1-43 first occurred in the basal portion of the cochlea at P0 and progressed toward the apex over the subsequent week. Electrophysiological recordings obtained from 234 outer hair cells between E17 and P8 from four cochlear regions revealed a correlation between the pattern of FM1-43 uptake and the acquisition of mechanotransduction. We found a spatiotemporal gradient in the properties of transduction including onset, amplitude, operating range, time course, and extent of adaptation. We used quantitative RT–PCR to examine relative mRNA expression of several hair cell myosins and candidate tip-link molecules. We found spatiotemporal expression patterns for mRNA that encodes cadherin 23, protocadherin 15, myosins 3a, 7a, 15a, and PMCA2 that preceded the acquisition of transduction.

It is widely gaining acceptance in the world of today to the extent that this emerging global process determines successes and failures of nation states' cultural, economic and social lives. The article attempts to address some critical policy issues on globalisation and gives an overview on the expected role of the states in pursuit of a better global public administration. The article identifies a link between public leadership and governance bringing out some benefits and challenges of globalisation in global policy-making. Some of the basic policy issues such as social, political, economic and technological were identified as keys towards transforming policy-making in the present globalisation era. Attempts were made to develop strategies that could encourage good leadership and governance through sustainable democracy and transparency at all levels of government. Conclusions were drawn on the urgent need for some global policy alternatives aimed at outcome based methods which targets specific policy needs at all levels of public leadership and governance terrain.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In the context of the model analyzed in this paper, the operational gains are subject to inherent volatility in both the price and the output of the intermediate product transferred within the vertically integrated structure. Our model framework provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the value (NPV) of an integrated system to exceed the sum of two optimized subsystems on their own. We then calibrate the model in Germany and Texas for systems that combine wind energy with Power‐to‐Gas (PtG) facilities that produce hydrogen. Depending on the prices for hydrogen in different market segments, we find that a synergistic investment value emerges in some settings. In the context of Texas, for instance, neither electricity generation from wind power nor hydrogen production from PtG is profitable on its own in the current market environment. Yet, provided both subsystems are sized optimally in relative terms, the attendant operational gains from vertical integration more than compensate for the stand‐alone losses of the two subsystems.","[{""country"":[""Germany"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

By insisting that southern Thai Malay-Muslims identify as Thai rather than as Malay, the Thai state and its Buddhist citizens view Malay-Muslims insistence on their Malay identity as not only a rejection of Thai-ness but also as a threat to the sovereignty of the Thai nation-state. By comparing the Thai-Malays with the Thai-Chinese, the most discriminated minority in the history of Thailand, the author argues that forging of economic links within and outside of Thailand has helped the Thai-Chinese attain both political and economic success in Thailand while the promotion of separatist identities such as Malay and Islam have bequeathed the Thai-Malays with a legacy of violence.","[{""country"":[""Thailand""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Nonetheless, we must expose such friendly-fascism not just to redress individual cases of injustice but also to realize democracy in its deepest, noblest sense. For academic fascism does not spring from a vacuum nor does it simply exercise power for power’s sake. Rather, the academy has a history of aiding and abetting the highest form of public power: i.e., the state. This is precisely why all of us, not just “women” or “minorities,” must confront and defeat academic fascism. When the academy’s High Priests work in tandem with the Leviathan’s Generals, we Heathens risk losing not just our lives on the battlefield or our livelihoods to the internal exile of unemployment/underemployment but also our souls to the state’s single-minded power machine.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In effort to identify these experiences, we build precious work and explore the ways that Black children describe their informal engineering learning experiences. In this qualitative study, we will analyze eight interviews from Black and mixed- race middle school aged children from two different regions of the United States. Using narrative inquiry, the data will be explored to understand the stories children tell about their informal engineering learning experiences. We anticipate validating findings from previous work and shedding light on additional practices within the Black community that foster engineering attributes in middle school children. The anticipated contributions of this work are two-fold. Primarily, the findings of this work inform the interview protocol for a larger study investigating the ways the Engineer of 2020 attributes can be fostered in Black males through their precollege lived experiences. Additionally, this work can provide evidence for the diverse ways that Black children can learn engineering within their own communities. With this evidence, educators and engineering education researchers can establish stronger connections between students' lived experiences and the classroom and potentially increase interest in engineering careers and degrees among Black children.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To do this effectively, managers often develop networking relationships with key stakeholder groups in order to make critical resources available. Managers in public service organizations, in particular, are frequently under great pressure to network with relevant actors from stakeholder groups in order to build support for service (co)production and legitimacy for strategic and operational decisions. To identify networking strategies which are conducive to stakeholder support, we explore the networking behaviour of over 1,000 English local government managers. Fuzzy cluster analysis identifies four distinctive, though inter-related types of managerial networking: technical, reputational, political, and tokenistic. The cluster membership functions from this analysis are used to examine the relationship between types of networking and stakeholder support in depth. The results of hierarchical regression analysis suggest that technically-orientated networking is the most conducive to stakeholder support, with tokenistic networking the least conducive.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In cases such as Unocal, Royal Dutch and Blackwater, to name a few, attorneys have procured large settlements. With those multinationals as defendants and with larger settlements, however, have come more sophisticated and better equipped defense lawyers who have raised ancillary and adjective issues that have not been raised before, or at least inquired into in detail. This article discusses a few of them, such as choice of law, piercing the corporate veil, secondary liability, agency, and partnership or joint venture. Most recently, the crowning issue, whether corporations may be held at all under the ATS has come to the fore and, if answered in the negative, will bring things full circle, ending the heyday of ATS litigation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Gilthead sea bream juveniles were exposed to a 21-days fasting period followed by 2 h to 7-days refeeding. Fasting provoked a decrease in body weight, somatic indexes, and muscle gene expression of members of the Gh/Igf system, signaling molecules (akt, tor and downstream effectors), proliferation marker pcna, myogenic regulatory factors, myostatin, and proteolytic molecules such as cathepsins or calpains, while most ubiquitin-proteasome system members increased or remained stable. In bone, downregulated expression of Gh/Igf members and osteogenic factors was observed, whereas expression of the osteoclastic marker ctsk was increased. Refeeding recovered the expression of Gh/Igf system, myogenic and osteogenic factors in a sequence similar to that of development. Akt and Tor phosphorylation raised at 2 and 5 h post-refeeding, much faster than its gene expression increased, which occurred at day 7. The expression in bone and muscle of the inhibitor myostatin (mstn2) showed an inverse profile suggesting an inter-organ coordination that needs to be further explored in fish. Overall, this study provides new information on the molecules involved in the musculoskeletal system remodeling during the early stages of refeeding in fish.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Since the tax reduction applied also to excisting employments, the cost of the reform was sizable, and the estimated cost per created job is at more than four times that of directly hiring workers at the average wage. Hence, we conclude that payroll tax cuts are an inefficient way to boost employment for young individuals.","[{""country"":[""Sweden""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Based on ethnographic fieldwork among costumed re-enactors reinvigorating the American Civil War, it explores participants’ close connections to specific objects and ensembles of objects and the crucial role awarded to ‘experience’ and ‘touch’ in this genre of relating to the past. It is argued that three interrelated propositions derived from my analysis allow a better understanding of this popular heritage practice: (1) Re-enactment can be understood as a human-material ‘patchworking’ process, (2) Re-enactment comprises a ‘holistic’ enterprise and (3) A key motivation in re-enactment derives from its ‘unfinishedness’. By attending to these dimensions through a detailed analysis that takes the role of objects and their experiential potential seriously as going beyond ‘representation’, I argue that the re-enacted Civil War serves as an often implicit and non-verbal – but, precisely, enacted – critique of conventional approaches to learning about and exhibiting history and heritage, such as those epitomised by the conventional museum.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The automatic GWAS dataset attribute recognition system achieved an F-measure of 84.85%. We further applied the GWAS attribute recognition system to indexing MEDLINE abstracts and built an online GWAS dataset search engine called ""GWAS Dataset Finder"". Our evaluation showed that the GWAS Dataset Finder outperformed PubMed significantly in retrieving literature with desired datasets. Our study demonstrates the potential application of text mining methods in building the data discovery index.

After transfection of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of GFP encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. This system has expedited the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses for a variety of purposes.

Dialectics between identity and otherness is, first of all, dialectics between different signs. On the one hand, s igns make difference : indeed, every culture, by means of its (verbal and non-verbal) signs, distinguishes itself from the others, and affirms its identity. Social and cultural distinctions are distinctions made of and by signs; in this case – paradoxically –, difference means identity . But if we consider as a fact that different cultures produce different signs, and if we consider every sign as interpretable, then we also have to admit that intercultural translation is possible. From such a perspective, difference makes signs , and translation constitutes the semiotic process through which new sign systems could arise from the dialogical encounter between differences .

Cause-specific mortality was assessed over a median of 55.6 months (range 0.33-74.4 months) through 12/31/2000 using the National Death Index. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: At entry, mean (+/-SD) age was 50.6+/-15.0 years (range 23-87) and years since injury was 17.5+/-12.8 years (range 1.0-56.5). Mortality was elevated (observed/expected deaths=37/25.1; SMR=1.47; 95% CI=1.04-2.03) compared to US rates. Risk factors for death were diabetes (RR=2.62; 95% CI=1.19-5.77), heart disease (RR=3.66; 95% CI=1.77-7.78), reduced pulmonary function, and smoking.

At that time, over eighty-five percent of federal collections consisted of consumption taxes: import duties and various excise taxes including taxes on tobacco and liquor, and stamp taxes, including taxes on playing cards.3 The Committee report added that ""[n]o civilized nation collects so large a part of its revenues through consumption taxes as does the United States, and it is conceded by all that such taxes bear most heavily upon those least able to pay them.""4 After noting that Great Britain collected more than half of its revenue from income and inheritance taxes the Committee added:It is probable that no country in the world derives as much revenue per capita from its people through consumption taxes as does the United States. It is therefore deemed proper that, in meeting the extraordinary expenditures for the Army and Navy, our revenue system should be more evenly and equitably balanced and a larger portion of our necessary revenues collected from the incomes and inheritances of those deriving the most benefit and protection from the Government.5Congress's solution was an inheritance tax.6 But once the United States entered World War I, even the inheritance tax was not enough of a supplement to the consumption taxes to finance the war, and the United States turned to a much broader income tax than it imposed previously.7 It is worth appreciating, however, what led Congress to impose the estate tax in 1916. Congress, as expressed in the Committee report, was concerned with the equity of the tax system, and was looking for a way to impose the tax burden on ""those deriving the most benefit and protection from the Government."" 8With that in mind, it is fair to ask what Congress concluded best measures the benefits and protections derived from the government. Applying the tax to estates suggests that those who have died in the current year (or their heirs) best fit that category. But presumably Congress did not conclude that the best indicator of someone's benefiting from the government was his or her death in the current year. It would seem that Congress introduced the estate tax because it felt that those with large holdings of wealth had benefitted from protection from the government in the past. This suggests that the estate tax was a surrogate for a wealth tax.9 The visceral argument for a wealth tax remains to this day. When Warren Buffett criticizes our current system because he pays tax at a lower rate than his secretary, he may well be appealing to the idea that wealth, rather than income, is a fairer way of gauging who should support our government.10 The ""Buffett Rule"" is a tax on income, but it is phrased as a tax imposed on millionaires, a term traditionally based on wealth.11In any event, when the needs of government escalated dramatically with the entrance of the United States into World War I, Congress expanded the individual income tax that it had first passed in 1913.12 Presumably it relied on the income tax, rather than any form of wealth tax, because it appears much easier to measure income than to determine each individual's wealth.After more than one hundred years of experience with the income tax, that presumption is worth reexamining. Although it may still seem difficult to evaluate everyone's wealth, the growth in size and complexity of the federal income tax suggests that measuring income may not be as easy as was first believed. That is not to suggest that measuring wealth would be easy. The point of this exercise is to compare the complexity of the wealth tax with the complexity of our income tax. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

There has been little research on either the use of such complementary childcare by parents, or of the carers who undertake it, and this is a review of a two-stage investigation of both. One of the earliest initiatives of the Labour government elected in 1997 was to put a National Childcare Strategy in place. The strategy recognised the importance of childcare both for the development of children and in enabling parents – particularly mothers – to go out to work. To date, however, childcare needs and provision have been assessed almost entirely in terms of formal childcare. A clear understanding of why working parents use complementary childcare (particularly from grandparents) is essential for any childcare policy that hopes to be attuned to what families actually want. The article argues that policy makers, lured by a simplistic vision of economic vitality into adopting a behavioural paradigm from economics – in which parents are assumed to respond to purely financial incentives – are likely to find themselves distracted from important issues of the social well-being of working families with children. Childcare needs are related to dramatic changes in women's labour market participation over recent years, where the largest increase in female employment has been among mothers of children under the age of five. Neither mothers nor fathers may be in a position to provide the desired amount of childcare inside the nuclear household. This situation gives rise to the possibility of a ‘childcare deficit’. In failing to acknowledge and underpin the value which parents place upon complementary forms of childcare, policy makers are in danger of committing themselves to institutional arrangements which may make that deficit worse in the longer term.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This, it seemed to westerners in Moscow, was very odd. The Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party (CPSU) had formally ended that afternoon. So why was the Party headquarters still humming with activity that night? It was not many days before inflammatory rumours began to circulate, fuelled by western diplomats with good connections to their Central European communist colleagues, and by western correspondents of communist newspapers. Scarcely credible tales were whispered that Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU, had made a sensational speech denouncing Stalin for heinous crimes, including murder and torture. As it was a mere three years since Stalin's death, this seemed barely credible. True, for many months the rigidly controlled press had been full of mounting attacks on the 'cult of personality', obviously a veiled reference to Stalin. This criticism had reached a crescendo during the Twentieth Congress, though only Anastas Mikoyan, Khrushchev's right hand man, had been authorized to criticize Stalin cautiously by name in a published speech. But overt charges of torture and murder? Surely impossible. The rumours in 'diplomatic circles' suggested nevertheless that something totally unprecedented really had happened: a furious personal denunciation of the man who, only three years before, had been looked upon as God by the overwhelming majority of the population. Now, it seemed, God had been cast down and showered with accusations of committing appalling crimes and oppression on a massive scale. Nothing, however, appeared in the Party or government press. The rumours could not be substantiated. But they were so insistent that my colleague in Reuters news agency, Sidney Weiland, filed a report of four brief paragraphs. This stated merely that 'diplomatic circles' were a-buzz with rumours of a speech by Khrushchev denouncing Stalin at a special meeting after the formal end of the Party Congress. But in those days there was prior censorship in the USSR. Western correspondents had to write and send their stories from a special office in the Central Telegraph building. Weiland handed in his story for cabling, fully expecting it to be censored. He was right; it vanished into the censor's maw and was never heard of again.","[{""country"":[""Russian Federation""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Little is known about longitudinal changes in caregivers' burden in Japan. Between 1998-1999, 47 pairs of impaired elderly and their caregivers were followed in Matsuyama Town in a rural area of northern Japan. Caregivers were interviewed initially and then again 12 months later. Findings indicated that the mean score of the Zarit Burden Interview at Time 2 was significantly lower than that of Time 1, suggesting that caregivers adapted to their role over time. Outcomes were further categorized as successful and unsuccessful, depending on the pattern of change over one year. Two factors were related to the outcome in univariate analyses: caring for someone with dementia, and caregiver being a spouse. Logistic regression demonstrated that caring for someone with dementia was five times more likely to be associated with an unsuccessful outcome. The caregiver spouse was five times more likely to be associated with a successful outcome, while daughters-in-law were more likely to have an unsuccessful outcome. The present study suggests that (1) changes in well-being among caregivers in Japan are similar to those observed in most studies in the West, and (2) there was evidence of both the adaptation and wear-and-tear models among caregivers over time.","[{""country"":[""Japan""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Research findings on this issue are varied and often contradictory and, in general, appear to lack a synthesizing theory. This lack of synthesis appears to be especially prevalent with regard to an understanding of public perceptions of crime in general versus public perceptions of specific crimes. It is suggested that the application of attitude formation and response theory might provide a more comprehensive understanding of this general/specific fear of crime issue. Specifically, it is argued that attitude formation and response theory might better explain why public perceptions of general and specific crimes are skewed and what cognitive factors lead to this discrepancy. As such, the current study had two major objectives. The first goal of this study was to compare perceived and actual crime rates to determine if people are able to accurately assess the occurrence of both general and specific crime in their areas. The second of the research was to apply attitude formation theory to interpret fear of crime, specifically with regard to cognitive antecedents and responses. As expected, results indicate that subjects are inaccurate in their assessment of general crime rates but very accurate in terms of their assessment of specific crime rates. In addition, there was a significant relationship between subjects' attitudinal antecedents and their responses regarding fear of crime. Findings are discussed in terms of improvements to the measurement of fear of crime and associated responses to this phenomenon. The past two decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in research on peoples' perceptions of crime and their associated feelings of safety and security (see e.g., Farrall, Bannister, Ditton & Gilchrist, 1997). Surveys of the community are regularly conducted by police services, government agencies and academic researchers to assess levels of worry and perceived prevalence of crime. Such data may be used to identify specific areas of concern, target programs for improving safety and security, or to better understand peoples' assessments and concerns about crime. Some police services even incorporate community perceptions of crime risk and feelings of safety as performance indicators equal to that of the actual offence rate. In Western Australia, for example, one of the five core functions of the Police Service is maintenance of the peace. This core function includes preserving public order and promoting a sense of security in the community and a primary performance measure of this function is the proportion of the community who feel safe and secure (Western Australia Police Service, 1999). Although there has been a great deal of so called 'fear of crime' inquiry, researchers often have difficulty defining what exactly fear of crime characterizes (Farrall et al., 1997). Broadly speaking, fear of crime has encompassed measures ranging from affective fear reactions in specific settings (Nasar & Jones, 1997; van der Wurff, van Staalduinen & Stringer, 1989) through to individual assessments of crime risk or prevalence (O'Connell & Whelan, 1996; Rountree & Land, 1996b). Depending on the theoretical focus of the research, methodology of the study, and/or interpretation of the investigator(s), numerous conflicting findings have been reported (Farrall et al., 1997). Ongoing disagreement by researchers over the structure and measurement of fear of crime, along with persisting discrepancies amid research data, appear to characterize this field of study. The fact that perceptions of safety and fear of crime have been so rigorously investigated, and that research findings have become so important to law enforcement and community leaders, highlights the importance of continued empirical examination of this area. …","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In addition these differences are unrelated to the respective levels of income per capita and display a large persistence over time. Existing economic theories of immigration cannot explain these facts. This paper presents a dynamic political-economy model of immigration where agents choose an immigration policy at each period. In the model immigration poses a trade-off to the native voters. Wage gains from a given immigration policy need to be compared to its expected political costs (if any). The latter may arise because immigrants gain voting rights and their political preferences may be against those of the voters who let them in. The equilibrium can be characterized analytically. Immigration is shown to depend crucially on the degree of intergenerational mobility in skills in the economy. When mobility is low the political effects of immigration determine the policy whereas for high mobility the wage motive dominates. For some parameters the model produces immigration patterns that resemble those present in the data. In the last section I plan to test whether the model provides an answer to the empirical puzzle.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The work of Zadie Smith, in her novel White Teeth, depicts racialized women struggling with their identities as mothers while negotiating their experiences from being mothered in a different culture and how to mother for a “new” nation. Smith depicts women who have migrated from Bangladesh and the Caribbean, and take up their roles as mothers in England. This cross-cultural shift, in turn, shapes how they feel about themselves as mothers. This is not to say that these women are disempowered; rather, there are moments of isolation in their practice as mothers, which facilitate empowerment. While the boundaries of patriarchal motherhood limit mothers’ authority in their roles, this paper argues that these boundaries present unique challenges for women living in Diaspora. This paper will look at Diasporic women’s navigation of the patriarchal institution of motherhood. Diaspora is experienced differently on the basis of gender, racial identity, class, and nationhood. This paper utilizes a feminist mothering theoretical lens under which empowered mothering is recognized as an alternate location for resistance to occur.","[{""country"":[""Bangladesh"",""Caribbean small states"",""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

On a variety of indicators of political and civic involvement, including voter participation, involvement as members and leaders in civic groups, religious involvement, philanthropy, and even informal activities such as dinner parties and picnics, Americans have fewer connections with their neighbors than they did in the 1950s and 1960s. The decline in social capital has serious ramifications for American society. Bowling Alone found that social capital is closely associated with a variety of important indicators of community health, including better child welfare and school performance, decreased crime and aggressiveness, better health status, and even lower levels of tax evasion. Obviously, women benefit from many of these resources as members of their communities. But are levels of social capital of special concern to improving women’s status in particular? Might women benefit in special ways from the positive conditions associated with social capital? Should the debate over how to increase social capital be of concern to women and women’s organizations? To help answer these questions, this Briefing Paper analyzes the relationships between social capital and indicators of women’s status. Using data on social capital from Bowling Alone and data collected by IWPR for its Status of Women in the States project, the paper assesses trends across the states on both dimensions. Overall, the findings suggest that there is a strong relationship between levels of social capital and women’s status.

European Union countries face a comparable set of socio-economic challenges: from rationalization of the welfare systems and generation of economic growth and employment, to absorption of immigrant communities and the granting of legal rights to minorities with alternate life-styles. Despite these general similarities, a striking feature of politics in Europe is the diversity of political competition present in its political systems. While in some countries political contest occurs primarily over economic policy, the political debate in others centers on issues such as protection of national culture and state sovereignty. This paper aims to address how political competition can be theoretically comprehended, and what accounts for the variance in the content of European political contestation. To answer these questions, this paper builds on spatial theory of political competition, and develops two additional concepts: political space and axis of competition in the opening theoretical section. The second section of this work turns to the empirical expression of the axis of competition in Europe. The third section serves as a demonstration of the conceptual framework. It performs a multinomial logit analysis on individual vote choice, linking the variation of competition axes to electoral competition. The paper argues for understanding political competition in the light of political space and axis of competition. It emphasizes that the particular content of competition stems from the interaction of supply and demand factors, the interplay between individual preferences and party strategies. There is a connection between the nature of party competition expressed by the slope of the competition axis and the particular issues that individual voters consider when selecting a political party. Consequently, where party competition unfolds along an economic dimension, voters consider major political parties on the basis of their economic inclinations, while where political contest occurs along a social dimension, social issues play a more significant role in vote choice for major parties. Minor parties, somewhat marginalized in the political system, seek to highlight other issues, competing for votes along secondary dimensions or non-policy issues.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

There is increasing evidence, however, that linguistic processes, such as those underlying the planning of words, cannot proceed without paying some form of attention. Here, we review evidence that word planning requires some but not full attention. The evidence comes from chronometric studies of word planning in picture naming and word reading under divided attention conditions. It is generally assumed that the central attention demands of a process are indexed by the extent that the process delays the performance of a concurrent unrelated task. The studies measured the speed and accuracy of linguistic and nonlinguistic responding as well as eye gaze durations reflecting the allocation of attention. First, empirical evidence indicates that in several task situations, processes up to and including phonological encoding in word planning delay, or are delayed by, the performance of concurrent unrelated nonlinguistic tasks. These findings suggest that word planning requires central attention. Second, empirical evidence indicates that conflicts in word planning may be resolved while concurrently performing an unrelated nonlinguistic task, making a task decision, or making a go/no-go decision. These findings suggest that word planning does not require full central attention. We outline a computationally implemented theory of attention and word planning, and describe at various points the outcomes of computer simulations that demonstrate the utility of the theory in accounting for the key findings. Finally, we indicate how attention deficits may contribute to impaired language performance, such as in individuals with specific language impairment.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, policy and decision makers in the education system often find the task of determining the cost of education a tedious and difficult process. This is, in part, due to the complexity of education systems and the large number of stakeholders involved. Thus, it is the purpose of this paper to provide an overview of the term ‘adequate education’ and subsequently critically review the various methods that are currently utilized worldwide to determine the cost of adequate education. In doing so, the paper attempts to compare and contrast the various methods in an objective manner by identifying and evaluating the major advantages and disadvantages of each method.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Methods: A retrospective review was conducted at Prince Rashid Bin Al-Hassan Hospital between August 2011 and March 2012. File and photographs review of 55 patients who attended the ophthalmology clinic and found to have corneal metallic foreign body were included in this study. The following data were extracted and analyzed: age, gender, past ocular history, mechanism and time of injury and whether any eye protective measures were taken for those who were exposed to trauma during work, time to receive treatment, method of corneal foreign body removal, number of foreign bodies, location, depth of foreign body in the cornea, whether the eye was patched or not after removal of corneal foreign body, associated ocular injury, presence of Bell’s phenomenon, complications, and duration of absence from work. Results: All patients were males and the age ranged between 17 and 55 years (mean 31.3 years). Eighty- two percent of eye trauma occurred during work and all of them did not use any protective measure during their work activity. The mid third of the cornea was involved in 39% of patients followed by the paracentral zone in 27%. Corneal foreign bodies were removed by 27 gauge needle in 68% of patients. Eye patch was not used in 48% of patients after removal of foreign body. The most common associated finding was corneal rust in 63% of cases. Absence from work ranged between two to nine days. Conclusion: Corneal foreign bodies are potentially sight threatening that occurs mostly as a result of occupational accidents in male workers who do not comply with the use of eye protection. Educational and safety programs and patient counselling on proper eye protection are essential and must be implemented in the work places to prevent serious eye injuries and work loss.","[{""country"":[""Jordan""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

They average 25%-250% more citations in all 12 disciplines tested so far. Ninety-four percent of journals endorse immediate OA self-archiving. There is no evidence that self-archiving induces subscription cancellations. The “OA advantage” consists of: Early Advantage (early self-archiving produces both earlier and more citations), Usage Advantage (more downloads for OA articles, correlated with later citations), Competitive Advantage (relative citation advantage of OA over non-OA articles: disappears at 100% OA), Quality Advantage (OA advantage is higher, the higher the quality of the article) and Quality Bias (authors selectively self-archiving their higher quality articles – a non-causal component: disappears at 100% OA). We are currently comparing the OA advantage for mandated and spontaneous (self-selected) self-archiving. Deposit rates in Institutional Repositories (IRs) remain at 15% if unmandated, but climb toward 100% OA if mandated, confirming surveys that predicted 95% compliance. In the UK, 4 of the 8 research funding councils and the Wellcome Trust mandate self-archiving and it is being considered by the European Commission and the US federal FRPAA. There is no reason for universities to wait for the passage of the legislation. Five universities and two research institutions (including CERN) have already mandated it, with documented success. An Immediate-Deposit/Optional-Access Mandate covers all cases and moots all legal issues: metadata are immediately visible webwide and, where needed, access to the postprint can be set as Closed Access instead of OA throughout any embargo period. Software to support this approach (that allows the author to email individual copies of non-Open Access papers to individual requesters) has been created for both EPrints and DSpace repository platforms.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this paper, there is a substitution effect between bonds issued by different countries because they are competing with each other on international borrowing. The relative fundamentals, rather than the absolute fundamentals, determine the magnitude of the substitution effect, and thus the direction of lenders' cross-border capital movements. Specifically, when the difference in countries' fundamentals is large enough, international lenders would like to move toward countries with relatively low future default risks, which improves these countries' borrowing conditions and deteriorates other countries'. Furthermore, the safer countries accommodate lenders' capital movements by issuing more debt, which reduces the borrowing resources available to other countries, further intensifies the difficulties faced by countries with deteriorated borrowing conditions, and may finally force these countries to default. Such forces were quantitatively important in explaining the empirical evidence from the recent European Debt Crisis: European peripheries had difficulty raising funds in international markets, while in countries such as Germany, and the United States, the yields declined and the debt positions rose since 2010.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The occurrence of junctional ectopic rhythm (JER), including junctional ectopic tachycardia, following AVNRT ablation has been described as an extremely rare phenomenon, but may be underestimated. We aimed to determine the incidence of JER following AVNRT ablation within our institution, as well as that reported in the literature via an extensive review. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We reviewed our adult ablation institutional experience for the occurrence of JER after AVNRT ablation from 2009 to 2016. Additionally, we conducted an extensive literature search using different databases looking for AVNRT ablation case series. The individually reported complications of these studies were reviewed, with a primary endpoint defined as the occurrence of JER shortly after AVNRT ablation. The study was approved by our institutional review board. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Our institutional data revealed 6/126 patients (prevalence 4.8%) developed non-preexisting JER post-AVNRT ablation. Four patients were asymptomatic. Two patients had persistent symptoms lasting over a year, with one patient requiring repeat ablation. The literature review included 149 adult and pediatric studies. There were three cases of reported JER, out of a total of 37,541 patients (31,768 adults and 5,773 pediatric; prevalence 0.008%). The three JER patients were pediatric, and all required further therapeutic intervention. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: JER might be an underreported complication of AVNRT ablation. It seems most often to be transient and self-limited, occurring days to weeks after ablation, but may also be debilitating, requiring more aggressive management.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

For this latter purpose, we use results about average of options provided in Shackleton and Wojakowski (2007). As a by-product, we extend the approach of Tserlukevich (2008) by introducing the employment level to analyze in particular the optimality of the financial structure and leverage. Our approach allows us to get a quasi-explicit solution of the optimal firm's value that can be deeply analyzed.

Formally, the arbitrator is an agent of the contracting parties in dispute, a creature of a discrete contract gone wrong. Yet, increasingly, arbitrators are treated as agents of a larger global community, and arbitration houses concern themselves with the general and prospective impact of important awards. In this paper, I address these questions, first, from the standpoint of delegation theory. In Part I, I introduce the basic “Principal-Agent” framework [P-A] used by social scientists to explain why actors create new institutions, and then briefly discuss how P-A has been applied to the study of courts. Part II uses delegation theory to frame discussion of arbitration as a mode of governance for transnational business and investment. In Part III, I argue that the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is presently in the throes of judicialization, indicators of which include the enhanced use of precedent-based argumentation and justification, the acceptance of third-party briefs, and a flirtation with proportionality balancing. Part IV focuses on the first wave of awards rendered by ICSID tribunals pursuant to Argentina’s response to the crushing economic crisis of 2000-02, wherein proportionality emerged, adapted from the jurisprudence of the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Seventy-five percent (75%) of cases recur within two years and the recurrence rate is correlated with the grade of the initial tumor. While Transurethral Resection of the Bladder (TURB) is the current standard of care, the use of laser offers a proven alternative. Sufficient evidence is available that laser treatment of superficial bladder cancer is as effective as TURB. Laser treatment offers several advantages such as decreased incidence of bladder perforation, a near bloodless procedure, catheter-free procedure, and the possibility of outpatient therapy. It has been reported that laser treatment may reduce the recurrence rate of TCC as compared to electrocautery resection. Furthermore, some studies suggest seeding can be avoided with laser resection; however, both items remain highly controversial.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Analysis suggests that tenure mix—proportion of tenants to owners—affects what is available for rent and overall living conditions.

Both ‘demand’ and ‘supply’ factors explain the rise of targeted killings. Demand for targeted killings increased as the United States faced new threats from militant groups that could not be effectively countered with conventional military force. Concerns about the political consequences of long-term military involvement overseas and American casualties led political leaders to supply more targeted killings. The conclusion discusses how this tactic may have unintended consequences as other states follow the United States use of targeted killings.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In fact, scholars and environmentalists have observed that some of the causes of environmental deterioration are rooted in science and technology. It is clear that environmental problems need ethical solution. However, environmentally ethical behaviour (EEB) is often overlooked in the life of a Muslim. This behaviour is important, particularly, to ensure the future of civilization of the Islamic world and, generally, civilization as a whole. Given the fact that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are more sensitive to the transformation of public behaviour compared to other groups, this article discusses the perspectives of Malaysian NGOs on the transformation of Muslim EEB in Malaysia in three aspects: (a) The type of EEB practiced by Muslims in Malaysia; (b) The transformation process of EEB experienced by Muslims in Malaysia; and (c) Whether or not the transformation of EEB of Muslims in Malaysia is motivated by the values advocated by Islam. The research adopted a qualitative research method of data collection, i.e., focus group discussions (FGDs). FGD’s results illustrated that: (a) Pre-cycling, reusing and recycling are the common types of EEB practiced by Muslims in Malaysia; (b) The transformation process of EEB experienced by Muslims in Malaysia is not accelerating at the speed that we hoped for; and (c) The transformation of EEB of Muslims in Malaysia is motivated more by economic and social factors as well as level of education and regulation enforcement compared to the values advocated by Islam.","[{""country"":[""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In particular we look at the link between over-leverage and the number of banking relationships for a sample of Italian manufacturing firms, distinguishing between firms with a main bank and firms without a main bank. The main result of the paper is that the number of banking relationships increases with over-leverage only for firms without a main bank. We argue that this result is consistent with the view that, when banks perform transaction lending, firms can increase their debt capacity by increasing the number of creditors, promising ex ante up to the full amount of available assets to each one of the creditors.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is also demonstrated that high-resolution banding with basic fuchsin can reveal bands not present in the international standard idiogram of human prophase chromosomes (ISCN 1981). The technique described can also be used for easy recognition of the late replicating X chromosome, which stains darker than its early replicating homologue.

This article argues that political training reduces civilian killings, particularly among insurgent groups that emphasize the strategic and tactical importance of restraint towards civilian populations. We test the observable implications of our theory using survey data on ex-insurgents from Colombia and sub-national data on civilian killings. We find support for our hypothesis, with results that are robust to a range of model specifications and controls, including alternate sources of combatant discipline, such as military training and punishment.","[{""country"":[""Colombia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Surface coverings will lower the electrical injection and light extraction efficiency of perovskites. Therefore, structural modification of Zn doped perovskites has been proposed herein. The Zn doping will induce local lattice strain due to smaller ionic radius. It is interesting that the lattice structure at atomic resolution has been observed directly through cryo-TEM. Under light illumination, the photostriction will compensate for the local lattice strain, which leads to structural stability as evidence suggests no phase transition in temperature ranges of the temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra. In addition, MPZB also shows less than 3% decrease in PL intensity after 60 days. This is because the Zn doping induced the lowest defect density in the MPZB SC (density of trap-states ntrp = 6.33 × 108 cm-3), which has been confirmed by the high performance of the photodetector. Such strain compensation is expected to fundamentally improve the stability of photoelectric devices.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The serologic monitoring of domestic poultry is usually accomplished using the reference hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test for the detection of H5 and H7 subtypes. However, as the number of tested sera has been increasing, there is a need for another serologic method that could be used as a preliminary screening test. A comparison of four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests (two indirect and two competitive) was conducted, and they showed good specificity and higher sensitivity than the HI test. The selected ELISA tests were then tested using approximately 800 field sera representative of different poultry species, and a simulation was done to determine the best strategy for screening. The first strategy was testing both gallinaceous and nongallinaceous sera with a competitive ELISA and using the HI test for H5 and H7 as a confirmatory test. The second strategy was testing only gallinaceous bird sera with the indirect ELISA with confirmatory H5 and H7 HI and all nongallinaceous sera by the H5 and H7 HI test. In the Belgian poultry context, the best strategy seems to be the use of a blocking ELISA as the primary screening tool to test all the poultry sera, followed by confirmation by H5 and H7 HI test subtyping.","[{""country"":[""Belgium""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Isla presents a conceptual under-standing of this new form of capital accumulation, ""greening,"" which ""represents a new form of exchange value based on biological forms and processes such as genetics and medicinal plants (bio-products), air and scenery (non-material commons), and water (material commons), which, when facilitated by debt-for-nature, is inserted into many forms of international market relations."" She situates the ""greening"" of Costa Rica within an historical examination of the creation of the country's debt and the ways in which said debt has lent itself to exploitation of the country's natural and human resources through ""debt-for-nature"" exchanges within the discursive paradigm of ""sustainable development."" Isla argues that such exchanges have led to the privatization of biodiversity and commodification of natural elements, the privatization of the forest through the purchase of carbon credits from indebted rainforest-dense countries, the privatization of scenery that has resulted in the exclusion of local peoples from previously shared common spaces, wildlife, and agricultural land, the destruction of spaces and water resources by open-pit mining that has permanently damaged agricultural land and, thus, peasants' subsistence survival, and the creation of a cycle of indebtedness and exploitative working conditions. In particular, Isla highlights the exploitation of women within this context by claiming that socio-economic shifts due to heavy-handed neoliberal policies have resulted in a restructuring of social life such that many peasant women now lacking access to land for subsistence survival have become involved in sex trade work and a medicinal plant economy that has resulted in entrapment in a cycle of debt and exploitation. Here, Isla moves beyond a traditional historical materialist approach to instead adopt an ecofeminist stance. This allows Isla to incorporate the unpaid labour of women peasants in her analysis, and also the embodied and gendered nature of knowledge systems pertaining to such labour. The emphasis on such knowledge systems, particularly insofar as they highlight the interconnected nature of relationships between and among Costa Rica's people and also its complex agricultural and biological ecosystems, for Isla, aids in understanding and combatting the fragmenting and commodifying tendencies, and epistemological groundings, buttressing neoliberal projects. Isla's analysis of the process of ""greening"" is intricate and highly informative insofar as it details the interconnected nature of multi-national global economic policies (as well as the involvement of Canadian corporations) and local quotidian realities in isolated and rural areas of Costa Rica. …","[{""country"":[""Costa Rica""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this paper we elucidate the major problems of the international supply chain by analysing detailed bilateral trade data for three key export goods. We find that the current structure of the supply chain implies that when one part of the chain is cut, the whole chain will necessarily be affected.

While it is but a consequence of the existing pluralism in society which today is recognised by the most advanced states and communities of states as forming the practical and theoretical basis for all political institutions, islamic countries still reject what they consider simply a judeo-christian tradition; and the cairo declaration on Human rights in islam of 1990 subjects all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this declaration to the islamic sharia. the essential flaw of this position consists in that it regards religious liberty not a liberty of man but a liberty of truth. And since islam is considered to be the religion of true unspoiled nature it is concluded that there cannot exist any human right that is not supported by, or even runs counter to, islamic doctrine. Until this approach is overcome, there will not be true religious liberty in islamic countries. that it is possible, for a religious community that claims to be the keeper of religious truth, to overcome such an approach has been demonstrated in an exemplary manner by the catholic church. Papal teaching and ecclesiastical doctrine before the second vatican council maintained a position not unsimilar to that of the cairo declaration, arguing that error cannot claim the same right as truth. it was only the council’s declaration on religious liberty Dignitatis humanae of 1965 that brought about a radical change by recognising that religious liberty is a liberty of man deriving from his dignity as a free person and – as all human rights – not subject to any other restrictions than those which are necessary to protect the same rights and liberties of others. the position taken by the second vatican council can serve as a model for overcoming the traditional approach of religions and/or religious institutions and “religious” states towards freedom of religion.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

By developing a model of migration choice I find non-linear effects of gender inequality on the female brain drain ratio as a result of effects of gender inequality on both costs and benefits of migration. At low levels of women's rights, increases in the index lead to increases in the female brain drain ratio. This is consistent with, at low levels of women's rights, prohibitively high costs of migration for females. Once a certain level of protections has been afforded to them, the costs to migration are low enough that many women then decide to leave the oppressive society and migrate where the benefits associated with their human capital are higher. However, as women's rights continue to strengthen, those benefits to migration then tend to decrease. The effect on female brain drain then turns negative. Using a panel of up to 195 countries I find evidence consistent with this model which is robust to instrumental variable approach. A one-point increase in the above average level of this index is associated with an average of about a 25-percentage point decrease in the female brain drain ratio.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This almost doubles the capacity of enrolment while per capita expenditure on students in Higher Education has fallen to 20~25%. For this situation, India has a three pronged strategy – increase in the number of Higher Education institutes; increased intake in existing institutes; and emphasis on Distance Education mode. The surge of students towards Higher Education makes the issue of Quality Assurance very pertinent so as to ensure the delivery of agreed standards. Now India’s thrust is laid on ‘quality with relevance’ where excellence should be acquired by few institutions and quality be maintained by all. Thus the apex bodies of Indian Higher Education like University Grants Commission, Knowledge Commission, National Assessment and Accreditation Committee are looking for ‘quality gaps’ and design strategies to reduce these gaps. Whatever is proposed for maintaining quality in Higher Education in the 11 th Five Year Plan and the current efforts being taken are analyzed threadbare in this paper, and the views of academicians, educational administrators, students and other stake-holders are also taken into consideration. The results show that quality assurance process is mostly ‘output’- oriented, and effective measures for improvement in the ‘process’ part are still lagging due to different reasons. Also quality measures are focused on ‘Within National Boundaries’ and emphasis is laid merely on quality audit and accreditation. This paper critically appraises the pros and cons of quality assurance on the mobility of the students as the number of foreign students in India is dwindling and the interest of Indian students in foreign Institutes of Higher Education is rising. Findings of this study suggest that mere mechanical quality control and quality assurance cannot sustain the interest of the students in Indian Higher Education Institutes and the need is of launching quality enhancement programs in a quality culture environment.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Different test dose 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg body weight of METS were administered intra peritonealy (i.p) to various groups of mice for the evaluation of analgesic potential. Phytochemical screening confirmed the presence of flavonoids, tannins, saponins, anthraquinone, steroid, phlobatannin, terpenoid, glycoside and reducing sugars. METS was found safe at a dose of 1000 mg/kg body weight. A concentration dependent free radical scavenging effect was observed with methanolic aerial parts extract of Teucrium stocksianum (MAPETS) and methanolic roots extracts of Teucrium stocksianum (MRETS). MAPETS and MRETS have shown highest antioxidant activity 91.72% and 86.19% respectively at 100 μg/ml. MAPETS was found more rich (115.32 mg of GAE/g of dry material) in TPC as compared to MAPETS (105.41 mg of GAE/g). METS demonstrated a dose dependent antinociceptive potential in different pain models, like in acetic acid, formalin and tail immersion showing 83.103%, 80.872% and 67.58% at a dose of 150 mg/kg, similar to acetylsalicylic acid (74.79%, 82.87%, 100 mg/kg) and TramadolR (74%, 30 mg/kg) respectively. Strong antioxidant potential and high TPCs are residing in the methanolic extract of T. stocksianum. METS showed analgesic potential in all models of nociception implying that both peripheral and central pathways of analgesia are involved. This might be due to the presence of various classes of phytochemicals in the plant extract.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The isolate grew in the presence of 7-23 % (w/v) NaCl, but not in the absence of NaCl. Strain YIM 93246(T) had particular morphological properties, forming aerial mycelium that had long spore chains and pseudosporangium-like, rhiziform spore aggregates at maturity. LL-DAP was the cell-wall diamino acid and glucosamine, mannose, glucose, arabinose and galactose were the cell-wall sugars. The major fatty acids were iso-C(16 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). MK-9 (H(4)) was the predominant menaquinone and the genomic DNA G+C content was 70.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 93246(T) clustered with the genus Jiangella. The sequence similarities between strain YIM 93246(T) and Jiangella alba, Jiangella gansuensis and Jiangella alkaliphila were 96.9, 96.9 and 96.6 %, respectively. Based on morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic differences, and phylogenetic analysis, a novel genus and species, Haloactinopolyspora alba gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain of the species is YIM 93246(T) (=DSM 45211(T)=KCTC 19409(T)). Additionally, phylogenetic analysis placed the genus Jiangella together with strain YIM 93246(T) within the order Actinomycetales as an independent lineage, clearly distinguished from other described suborders of the class Actinobacteria. Hence, based on phylogenetic characteristics, the genus Jiangella together with the newly proposed genus Haloactinopolyspora are proposed to be classified as Jiangellaceae fam. nov. and Jiangellineae subord. nov.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

GluK1-3 are low-affinity subunits that form homomeric and heteromeric KARs, while GluK4 and GluK5 are high-affinity subunits that require co-assembly with GluK1-3 for functional expression. Although the subunit composition is thought to be highly heterogeneous in the brain, the distribution of KAR subunits at the protein level and their relative abundance in given regions of the brain remain largely unknown. In the present study, we titrated C-terminal antibodies to each KAR subunit using chimeric GluA2-GluK fusion proteins, and measured their relative abundance in the P2 and post-synaptic density (PSD) fractions of the adult mouse hippocampus and cerebellum. Analytical western blots showed that GluK2 and GluK3 were the major KAR subunits, with additional expression of GluK5 in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In both regions, GluK4 was very low and GluK1 was below the detection threshold. The relative amount of low-affinity subunits (GluK2 plus GluK3) was several times higher than that of high-affinity subunits (GluK4 plus GluK5) in both regions. Of note, the highest ratio of high-affinity subunits to low-affinity subunits was found in the hippocampal PSD fraction (0.32), suggesting that heteromeric receptors consisting of high- and low-affinity subunits highly accumulate at hippocampal synapses. In comparison, this ratio was decreased to 0.15 in the cerebellar PSD fraction, suggesting that KARs consisting of low-affinity subunits are more prevalent in the cerebellum. Therefore, low-affinity KAR subunits are predominant in the brain, with distinct subunit combinations between the hippocampus and cerebellum. ::: ::: ::: Kainate receptors, an unconventional member of the iGluR receptor family, have a tetrameric structure assembled from low-affinity (GluK1-3) and high-affinity (GluK4 and GluK5) subunits. We used a simple but novel procedure to measure the relative abundance of both low- and high-affinity subunits. This method revealed that the relative amount of GluK2 plus GluK3 subunits was several times higher than that of GluK4 plus GluK5 subunits, in both the hippocampus and cerebellum.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Influenza is also associated with significant economic losses in animal production. The most effective way to prevent influenza infections is through vaccination. Current vaccine programs rely heavily on the vaccine's ability to stimulate neutralizing antibody responses to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. One of the biggest challenges to an effective vaccination program lies on the fact that influenza viruses are ever-changing, leading to antigenic drift that results in escape from earlier immune responses. Efforts toward overcoming these challenges aim at improving the strength and/or breadth of the immune response. Novel vaccine technologies, the so-called universal vaccines, focus on stimulating better cross-protection against many or all influenza strains. However, vaccine platforms or manufacturing technologies being tested to improve vaccine efficacy are heterogeneous between different species and/or either tailored for epidemic or pandemic influenza.

Weaving evidence from interviews and historical sources together with two vignettes of Estonians performing temporal and ethnic others at themed costume parties, I show how the belief that Estonians are more civilized and better than Russians has shaped Estonian experiences of late socialism and the post-Soviet years. I argue that this common-sense notion of Estonians' relative superiority to Russians is animated by the same Eurocentric logic that is routinely used to legitimize and justify Western imperialism. Further, I show how in the Estonian context these ideas have been used to delegitimize, resist, and subvert Soviet-cum-Russian imperialism.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

There are (mainly) two visions on this theme: (i) those who deny any connection between Islam and democracy; and (ii) those who argue that Islamic tradition contains a number of concepts, ideals, institutions and values which are essentially democratic (in nature). In this direction, this paper exposes and elucidates how some scholars have employed certain concepts from the Islamic tradition like Shura, Ijtihad, Bay'ah, Khilafah, Ijma, Maslaha and Ahl al-hall wa al-'aqd-especially the first three-for conceptualizing a conceivable and feasible, possible and practicable foundation of democracy in Islam. In the final analysis, it is noted that throughout the Muslim world, majority of scholars accept the term 'democracy' and insist on consistency and compatibility between Islam and democracy albeit democracy here is conceived with certain qualifications and limits prescribed by Shari'ah. It argues, by way of conclusion, that although ""Islamic democracy"" has been discussed very much (in theory), a ""practical"" Islamic democratic model has yet to emerge. This is still a challenge for Muslim political theorists (particularly) in the 21 century. st","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Escherichia coli has been becoming much more resistant to β-lactam antibiotics and other commonly available antimicrobials. We investigated the prevalence, resistance, and probable gene type of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We have collected 289 single-patient E. coli Isolates based on samples of China from July 2013 to August 2014. This article explored that the prevalence of ESBL-producing Isolates showed multi-resistant to antimicrobials such as fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim, tetracycline and aminoglycosides, and so on. The frequencies of resistance in Isolates were as follows: Ciprofloxacin, 74%, gentamicin, 69.5%, levofloxacin, 63%, tobramycin, 39%, and minocycline, 7.9%. According to our results, 197(68.2%) of the total 289 Isolates were ESBL-producing strains; further, 172 (87.3%) producers contained genes encoding CTX-M enzymes and 142(72.1%) producers contained genes encoding TEM enzymes. Most ESBL-producing Escherichia coli has produced more than one type of β-lactamase. Nucleotide sequence analysis has revealed the diversity of ESBLs types: CTX-M -15 is in the majority and TEM-135, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-98, CTX-M-14, CTX-M-142, CTX-M-65, CTX-M-55, CTX-M-27, and CTX-M-123 have been recovered. The results confirm that ESBL producers which are common in hospital strains of Escherichia coli are resistant to cephalosporins and other antibiotics in China. It is important to monitor such strains closely and provide scientific evidence of rational application of antibiotics to prevent their spread.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

What are the determinants and policies needed for reduction in poverty? Has inequality increased in the reform period? What should be done to reduce inequalities? This paper addresses these questions relating to economic reforms, poverty and inequality. There has been visible change but some failures in the processes and outcomes in the post-reform period. Poverty declined faster in the second half of 2000s as compared to that of 1990s. Inequality increased in urban areas. Among other things, creation of productive employment is crucial for reduction in poverty and inequality. New generation wants equality of opportunity rather than just rights based approach.

How the Diffusion of Norms in the Global Climate Regime Affects International Climate Politics","Politics in the international climate regime is a balancing act between intra- and intergenerational justice, as it has to account for both the needs of developing countries and those of future generations. Following a constructivist approach, this paper argues that international climate politics are heavily dependent upon the way climate change and the appropriate behavior required to prevent it are constructed collectively. The article shows how the diffusion of norms and changing images of climate change have shifted the interests of the actors under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. As a result, adaptation became more and more widely accepted as a necessary step in international climate politics in advancing the strategy of climate change avoidance. This also represents a shift from a focus on intergenerational justice as the main normative goal of the convention, to a broader aim of sustainable development that comprises both inter- and intragenerational justice.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

As such we contribute to the literature on the translation of ideas firstly by explicating the concept of real-time translation work in a novel empirical context, and secondly theoretically, by drawing attention to the distinctive characteristics of trade union translation work.

The results indicate that measuring the decline in macroeconomic uncertainty with the volatility of shocks from a fixed-parameter autoregressive model overstates the decline in uncertainty by between 20% and 25%.

More recently Web 2.0 technologies have appeared. These have afforded shifts in our constructs of learning spaces: Blended-Space, Virtual-Space, Social-Space, and very recently the emergence of the PLE or personal learning environment. This paper presents results of a survey that is one element in a broad environmental scan of the e-portfolio field set against the blooming of Web 2.0. The survey probes the perceptions of New Zealand educators who lead; how they see e-portfolio trends, Web 2.0 integration, and their views of teacher education in a digital society in the context of e-portfolios. Critical perspectives around learner agency are explored. Questions are raised about the location of knowledge production and validation. Results indicate that Web 2.0 technologies are just coming to the attention of teacher-educator leaders, and are seen to offer potential to future e-portfolio practices. However the vision in respect to Web 2.0 and the PLE appears constrained in the main. A gap is identified around conceptualizing this as an integrative relationship. Further research into the alignment of e-portfolios within these emerging learning spaces is suggested.","[{""country"":[""New Zealand""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The languages genetically closest to Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian, are examined. Findings of the list task, a simple and elegant test for psychological salience of color terms, provide strong evidence that Ukrainian and Belarusian have also evolved a second BLUE. What is interesting is that the term is not the general East Slavonic term that Russian uses, but a Polish borrowing: blakytnyj ‘light blue’ (Ukrainian), blakitny ‘light blue’ (Belarusian). This opens up the possibility that a category, in this case the second BLUE, may be borrowed separately from the basic term that denotes it.

On the other hand, the national health institutions acknowledge the need of standards that include information technology elements in the medical practices. This paper delineates the basic elements for the development of a comprehensive framework for e-Health standardization in emerging economies taking into account the multidimensional and complex nature of the standardization process and the importance of the interactions among all the actors involved.

But the supply of skilled workers in the U.S. is just not keeping pace with the changes in demand due to technology and trade. Fixing this crisis requires us to understand both the skill quality of workers entering into the labor market and the nature of the stock of skills of workers already in the job market. This paper summarizes our knowledge on where workers get skills training and the returns to this training – both private and public.

We studied the association of selected food items and nutrients with IFG, IGT and combined IFG and IGT (IFG+IGT), independent of cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2max)). ::: ::: ::: SUBJECTS/METHODS ::: In a population-based sample of 1261 individuals, aged 58-78 years, we identified 126 subjects with IFG, 97 with IGT and 49 with simultaneous IFG and IGT by an oral glucose tolerance test. Dietary intake was assessed by 4-day food records. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by defining maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) from respiratory gas analysis during a maximal symptom-limited exercise stress test on a bicycle ergometer. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Increased intake of saturated fat was associated with higher odds for IFG (OR 1.07; 1.01-1.14) after adjustment for age, gender, VO(2max) and energy misreporting variable. Consumption of additional whole-grain bread (50 g/1000 kcal) and intake of dietary fiber (g/1000 kcal) were inversely associated with IGT (OR 0.61; 0.41-0.92, OR 0.91; CI 0.85-0.97, respectively). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Dietary fiber and sources of cereal fiber are negatively associated with IGT, and saturated fat intake is positively associated with IFG, but not with IGT. The present data give practical dietary means at the population level for the elimination of prediabetic conditions.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We argue that a broad range of formal and informal institutions have been reshaped, distorting the electorate’s capacity to assess political accountability and inhibiting the Madisonian system’s capacity to check both individual and institutional political ambition. We consider four institutional developments that have facilitated unrestrained political ambition. First, in the Senate, a silent Constitutional amendment has seemingly been effected, requiring a three-fifths Senate vote to pass legislation. In effect, new practices and minority filibusters have granted individual senators the right of veto. As a consequence, new and politically unproductive behavioral norms have been established in the Senate. Second, party politics and primary nominations have come to play a larger role in the shaping of federal policies, and have engendered a significant rise in the importance of individual and localized interests and passions. Third, changes to the news media and campaign technology have justified Madison’s fears about the “vicious arts” and their pernicious effects on elections. Finally, in an extended jurisdictional landgrab over the constitutionality of electoral law, the Supreme Court has begun to wield disproportionate power over the basic political processes of the United States, undermining the constitutional system of checks and balances. We conclude our argument by making a predictive claim regarding the most far-reaching contemporary policy issue, the regulation of health care. The authors of The Federalist, James Madison in particular, were of the mind that human ambition was the root motivation of politics. Now, however, poisoned by the systemic toxicity of the extra-Constitutional structural changes we describe, the new system sabotages Madison’s hope that social diversity, the virtue of officials, and the necessity of compromise would overcome the ills of individual ambition and the clash of institutions. Unchecked, political ambition weakens democratic accountability and effective government while promoting unfettered ideological conflict and personal aggrandizement.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This essay argues that the film thereby constitutes a striking example of absurdist cinema in general and of what has been called the ""Greek Weird Wave"" in particular. For, it refuses to reassert or privilege certain long-standing artistic norms and conventions or traditional values over others. It thus encourages viewers to put aside qualms (""bones"") they have with several scenes in order to appreciate better the questions the film raises about contemporary Western society, especially the social construction of the family in Greece, as well as the new ways the film allows us to rethink such questions.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

After tumor excision, pathohistological examination showed a follicular center cell lymphoma grade 2, B-cell type (CD20+, bc16+, CD10+, bcl2+). The final diagnosis was stage IEA primary extranodal non-Hodgkin s breast lymphoma. The involved breast was irradiated isocentrically with two opposite 6-megavolt (MeV) photon beams delivered from the linear accelerator (tangential fields) using asymmetric collimator opening. Radiation volume, inclinations of the medial and lateral field, and the part of the underlying chest wall and lung parenchyma were determined during the radiotherapy simulation process. The total irradiation dose was 44 Gy delivered in single daily doses of 2 Grays (Gy). After breast photon irradiation, a boost to the tumor bed was performed by a direct 12 MeV electron beam, with a total dose of 6 Gy delivered over three days. Since primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the breast is rather rare, there has been no uniform approach to its treatment. The advantage of applying the asymmetric collimator jaw opening in breast radiotherapy is the instant reduction of the dose at margin fields, resulting in both the protection of neighboring lung parenchyma and the good coverage of planned target volume.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, parents also have incomplete information regarding children preferences—which has not been considered. Using a strategic bequest framework, we show that when parents have sufficient uncertainty regarding children’s relocation returns, a separating equilibrium where parents reward attentive heirs with larger bequests is precluded.

The precise incidence of AA in India is not known due to lack of epidemiological study. 20-40% of pancytopenic patients in referral centres are of aplastic anaemia. Patients and Methods: This was an analysis of 1501 patients diagnosed with aplastic anaemia over a period of seven and half years (January 2007– June 2014) attending the Aplastic clinic of department of haematology of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The details regarding medical history, physical examination, complete blood count, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, treatment received, were retrieved. Inherited bone marrow failure was screened in patients below 35 years. Treatment response was analysed for various treatment modalities. Results: 1501 patients of AA from 20 different states of India were analysed. The bulk of patients were from Uttar Pradesh (28.7%), Bihar (23.6%), Delhi/NCR (20%) and Haryana (7%). The average number of new aplastic anaemia patients enrolled per year 214 (range: 101-263). The median age at presentation was 25 years (range 2–83), with M;F - 2.3:1. Severity of AA revealed: severe (SAA): 75%, very severe (VSAA): 15%, nonsevere (NSAA):10%. Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes constituted 5% (75 patients) of all aplastic anaemia patients. The most common clinical presentations were pallor (97%), bleeding manifestations (69.6%) and fever (54%). The haematological parameters showed: median level of haemoglobin level: 5.9 gm/dL, WBC: 2700/mm 3 , ANC: 380/mm 3 , platelet: 10000/mm 3 . PNH clone was present in 13.5% of patients. 107 patients (7%) were lost to follow up or expired before any treatment was initiated. Only 69 patients (4.5%) received treatment with HLA-matched sibling stem cell transplantation and another 232 (15.5%) patients received ATG plus cyclosporine as immunosuppressive therapy. Seven hundred thirteen patients (47.5%) received cyclosporine. The overall response to various treatment modalities was: HLA matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell transplant: 75.3%, Anti-thymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine: 58.7%, cyclosporine plus androgen: 45.6%, cyclosporine alone: 32.2%. Conclusion: Management of AA is a real challenge in developing countries. This is one of the largest case series from a single centre from India. It is our endeavour to reduce the detrimental outcome by increasing awareness among patients and referring physicians to reduce the delay between diagnosis and treatment.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Foreign policy analysts and makers often disregard the impact of public opinion. This article tries to analyze the impact of the perceptions between Turkish and Chinese peoples to the relations of both countries. In case of this the main question of this presentation is whether the public's attitude became a major hinder and heavily influenced the decision-makers or not on the basis of Turkish-Chinese relations. Diplomatic relations between Turkey and China in political and economic field have improved significantly in recent years. But the degree of favorability to people to people exchange is extremely low because of the influential factors, which are mostly stemmed from the issue of 'Eastern Turkistan', the thoughts of the past, the trade imbalance and the media's negative and adverse approach to the issues. In order to solve the low favorability problem, both sides not only should depend on exchange and dialogue institutionally, but also rely on social and cultural interactions","[{""country"":[""China"",""Turkey""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The ‘Science State – Smart State’ initiative of the Queensland Government involves an action plan for improving science education that includes a Science for Life action. A desired outcome is for an increased understanding of the natural world so that responsible decisions concerning our future wellbeing can be made in an age of science and technology. Biotechnology is a technology that is having profound impact on our lives. This paper describes how 15-16 year old students and biology teachers revealed a mismatch in both attitudes and interests towards biotechnology between the students and teachers. The findings are of interest as the teachers are writing biotechnology into their work programs in response to new syllabus documents. The teacher’s areas of interest did not match those of the students, possibly resulting in a curriculum the teachers want to teach, but the students do not want to learn.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

To increase aid effectiveness, some have argued that potential recipients should compete for aid. We experimentally test this proposition against a baseline treatment where groups of heterogeneous agents receive aid by improving environmental quality. With the first mechanism, aid is allocated based on the improvement of environmental quality by each group with the potential of multiple groups receiving aid. In the second mechanism, aid is competitively allocated only to the single group that has initiated the greatest improvement of environmental quality. Surprisingly, the average level of environmental progress is lower in a competitive setting than in the setting with the potential for multiple recipients. Underscoring this result is our finding that environmental progress is stable in the baseline but begins high and falls quickly with repetitions in the competition. Although the initial level of progress is higher on average in the competitive setting, this mechanism generates the highest variance which could be catastrophic to sensitive ecosystems. These findings have direct implications on which mechanism the granting agency should use dependent upon their specific objectives.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This business-like approach has transformed university presidents into CEOs, threatening the integrity of key educational and research functions of faculty and staff. This redirection of instruction and reorienting of curriculum affects the climate on many campuses. This study is important because it seeks to understand the elements that ensure a healthy faculty relationship with administrators. A qualitative case study method was utilized to interview 5 faculty within one college within a university in the Northwest region of the United States. The question sought in this study is: What are the things that build trust between faculty and administrators that create a healthy collegial academic environment? It is the goal of this project to identify the elements of a positive faculty climate. The study results will be helpful to administrators and faculty who have an interest in faculty-administrator relations.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Clonal organisms present a particular challenge in population genetics because, in addition to the possible existence of replicates of the same genotype in a given sample, some of the hypotheses and concepts underlying classical population genetics models are irreconcilable with clonality. The genetic structure and diversity of clonal populations were examined using a combination of new tools to analyse microsatellite data in the marine angiosperm Posidonia oceanica. These tools were based on examination of the frequency distribution of the genetic distance among ramets, termed the spectrum of genetic diversity (GDS), and of networks built on the basis of pairwise genetic distances among genets. Clonal growth and outcrossing are apparently dominant processes, whereas selfing and somatic mutations appear to be marginal, and the contribution of immigration seems to play a small role in adding genetic diversity to populations. The properties and topology of networks based on genetic distances showed a ‘small-world’ topology, characterized by a high degree of connectivity among nodes, and a substantial amount of substructure, revealing organization in subfamilies of closely related individuals. The combination of GDS and network tools proposed here helped in dissecting the influence of various evolutionary processes in shaping the intra-population genetic structure of the clonal organism investigated; these therefore represent promising analytical tools in population genetics.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For all surfaces, protein adsorption decreased as the storage time increased, and their decreasing rates were dependent on titanium topography. After 4 weeks, the amounts of albumin and fibronectin adsorbed by the acid-etched surface were only 20% and 35%, respectively, of that adsorbed by the fresh surface after 2 hours of incubation, and remained substantially low even after 24 hours. This time-dependent degradation in protein adsorption of titanium correlated with its naturally decreasing hydrophilicity, which was not observed for the nickel and chromium surfaces, indicating a titanium-specific biological aging.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Hence, this article will explore the relationship between massacres perpetrated by the police and police reform, with a particular focus on South Africa. The article concludes that, in the context of public order policing, massacres perpetuated by the police can contribute towards relatively immediate police reforms, particularly in terms of police strategies and tactics. In some circumstances, massacres have even led to some restructuring of the police organisation. The nature of the government and the policing environment appeared to be key determinants of the types of police reforms, post-massacre.","[{""country"":[""Africa Eastern and Southern""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

PISA 2009 results show that Belgium – despite being in the top 15 performers of all OECD participants - has one of the highest performance differences in Europe between children with and without an immigrant background. Furthermore, second generation immigrant children are doing worse than first generation immigrant children. This paper explores the determinants of school achievement, school failure and sorting of children with an immigrant background, using a new large survey of Flemish school children. The theoretical framework is based on the education production function literature and specific empirical socioeconomic literature on immigrant children, suggesting that personal factors, family conditions, school, peers, neighborhood, type of acculturation and history of migration matter to explain school achievement and failure. The empirical results show that unexplained differences between students with a Flemish, Turkish and Moroccan background remain after controlling for personal and background influences. A key finding is the large impact of innate ability and individual effort for all groups.","[{""country"":[""Belgium""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This incident raises some causes of concern. Firstly, critical infrastructure such as military and diplomatic systems is not spared from security breach. Secondly, such leak causes far-reaching damage to public interests, national security and economic sustainability. And thirdly, both technology and law seem incapable of dealing with such situation. Malaysia is not spared from the risk of information security attacks. Its ten critical sectors as identified in its National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP) -national defence and security; banking and finance; information and communications; energy, transport and water; government, emergency and medical services; as well as food and agriculture-can at any time fall victim to security breaches and data leaks if efforts to protect their system are flawed. The objective this paper is to outline the problems and challenges from the points of legal framework that Malaysia should anticipate and address in maintaining and sustaining its national CII. The paper first look at the problem of data breaches in the world and examine how as the technology becomes more superior, the cyber-world becomes more vulnerable to data breaches. Tied to that is the notion of critical information infrastructure (CIIs). As more and more of these CIIs are connected and dependent on connectivity, the normal incidence of data breach can be a potential of human loss and catastrophe. The paper next look at the concept of critical information security in Malaysia and examine the seriousness of data breaches in Malaysia. The paper seeks to explore legal options that Malaysia can adopt in preparing itself to more data breaches onslaught. It is the basic contention of the paper that the traditional legal framework should be reformed in line with the advances of the information and communications technologies.","[{""country"":[""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The European Union defines it as the “upper layer of earth’s crust, formed by mineral particles, organic matter, water, air and living organisms”. Despite such definitions, usually, planning choices do not take into account the need to reduce soil consumption to build up resilience. This paper presents the controversial case of Agri Valley (Basilicata, Southern Italy); on the one hand, this region is characterized by the presence of extremely valuable land, because of the exceptional degree of soil fertility; on the other hand, Valdagri is also known to have one of the largest oilfields of Europe. An application built around the SLEUTH model was developed in order to produce a simulation and an estimate of the extent to which urban areas may grow in the near future. Results confirm that urban policies implemented so far by local governments—which aimed almost exclusively to favor industrial development—irreversibly threaten the integrity of the natural values of the valley.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Economically, Beijing aims to decrease the drag on domestic growth and increase the overseas competitiveness of its largest firms known as yangqi, long plagued by declining performance, rising debt, and serious corruption.1 Politically, the Chinese Communist Party wants to reinforce state ownership as a pillar of domestic stability at home and increased influence abroad. To achieve these ends, Beijing released the long-delayed ""Guiding Opinions of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council on Deepening the Reform of State-Owned Enterprises"" in September 2015, to be followed by a series of detailed policy documents.2 This roadmap calls for regrouping state firms by function; further consolidating their assets, while simultaneously developing ""mixed ownership""; and loosening state authority over executive management, especially for those in nonstrategic sectors.3Categorizing SOEs into a public class (gongyilei) and a commercial class (shangyelei) is a transformative move at the heart of the new reforms. Firms will be divided by function into those dedicated to public welfare and those seeking profit. Future reforms will be carried out separately for these two groups in a dual-track approach: distinct strategic objectives will be set for each, and their performance will be evaluated by different metrics. While Beijing seeks to improve all SOEs' operational efficiency, service quality, and ability to innovate, profitability will always be a secondary priority for those charged with public welfare or national security functions. Specifically, the new guidelines stipulate that firms designated as public will be assessed by their ability to control costs, the quality of their goods and services, and the stability and efficiency of their operations.4 Political rather than market logic will therefore remain the paramount driver of changes to state firms in the public class. In contrast, boosting market competitiveness and delivering gains in financial performance will be a top priority for SOEs classified as commercial, to be assessed by indicators such as economic value added.5 However, these firms will still serve political goals, including fostering indigenous innovation, supporting social stability and crisis response in China, and advancing economic initiatives abroad such as ""One Belt, One Road.""This essay analyzes three challenges confronting this reform agenda: determining how and when to grant market forces a greater role, especially for state firms designated as commercial; aligning mismatched managerial interests and incentives; and overcoming complicating factors within companies. First, continuing government-directed mergers while restricting competition in protected sectors will boost state firms' market share at the risk of deepening their financial and operational weaknesses in the long term. Second, while the Xi administration is actively exercising personnel control, defined as the authority to appoint and remove top company leaders, shuffling executives cannot eliminate their mismatched incentives.6 Finally, the size, complexity, and cadre culture of SOEs will complicate reform implementation. Whether these difficulties can be surmounted will ultimately determine the success of Xi's reform agenda and China's economic transformation.CENTRAL STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISESChina's state-owned economy remains significant today. State firms' exact contribution to industrial output is debated but has been estimated at between 25% and 30%.7 State firms continue to enjoy advantages in obtaining bank loans and regulatory approvals, even if their privileged capital access has gradually declined. The central government currently owns 106 companies, out of which 47 firms ranked in the 2014 Fortune Global 500.8 These centrally owned firms, or yangqi, controlled more than $5.6 trillion in assets at the end of 2013, including more than $690 billion abroad. …","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This article argues that the principle of religious harmony helps to ensure that there are relative peace and tolerance among the various religious communities. But with religious revivalism and continual terrorist threats from some Islamist groups, it has become increasingly difficult for religious believers in Singapore to balance their national and religious identities, loyalties and duties. The on‐going challenge for the Singapore government is to promote a conception of ‘good citizens’ that takes into consideration the multiplicity and complexity of religion and citizenship.","[{""country"":[""Singapore""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This has been interpreted as a sort of structural break in stock market’s dynamics and a proof of the fallacy of one of the central tenets of financial advisory services: the importance of portfolio diversification. I will show, on the contrary, that this phenomenon is not at all surprising, given the increase in market volatility, and it derives from a very simple dynamic CAPM model. I calibrate the model over the last 20 years and show that it fits very well the observed dynamic of stock markets’ volatility and correlation. Finally, I use the model to investigate if the 2007–2008 environment should have been detrimental to bottom-up managers and favorable for top-down managers, as far as ‘alpha’ creation is concerned.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Less attention has been paid to what role government might have in this regard. In this article I explore the government’s role in what scholars sometimes refer to as ‘constitutional implementation’ and offer a theory of Canadian constitutionalism that better reflects this role. Following Alexy, I suggest that, guided by the ‘framework’ established by the Charter, government can be understood to play a central role in securing and advancing constitutional rights and values. If the Charter imposes explicit limits on state power as well as certain affirmative obligations, then the government’s role in constitutional implementation is much greater than is generally acknowledged. Once this role is better understood, certain deficiencies in the conventional account of Canadian constitutionalism become clear, particularly insofar as this account conceptualizes the Charter as comprising a series of limits on government power and imagines government as a potential rights-infringer to be reined in by the courts.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The author finds that the telenovela played an “orientation role,” providing interpretive frames that were often applied by viewers to current political issues.

The analysis carried out also high lights the major role played by regional size, level of development and geographical location in explaining specialization in the European context.

Specifically, this paper looks at changes in state-level agricultural production3 that have taken place in Mexico’s thirty-two states from 1993 to 20004. This paper seeks to identify whether the changes in agricultural production over this period are attributable to national or local economic conditions. Shift-share analysis is used to analyze change in production. While this descriptive technique does not offer any clarification regarding causality (Sihite et al. 1990) between currency devaluations and shifts in agricultural production, it permits examination of how structural and competitive forces allow agricultural production at the state level to perform differently from national production. This is achieved by disaggregating the change in production into several smaller components. The primary benefit derived from this study is the determination of whether the changes in agricultural production have allowed states to exhibit comparative advantages. This would provide appropriate information to policy makers in their development of policies affecting the agricultural sector in their respective jurisdictions.","[{""country"":[""Mexico""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A. Hayek's theory of spontaneous order applies to more than the market. One implication is that different systems of rules generating different spontaneous orders are biased in favor of different values. Markets serve the values of consumers; democracies serve the values of citizens. No spontaneous order perfectly reflects human values because they simplify the context of choice in favor of core systemic values. This insight enables us to distinguish between systemic and individual resources, and tensions between them. It also enables us to develop models of systemic conflict. Of particular interest are interactions between democracies and markets whose rules reflect different values but influence one another. The increasing commodification of the press shifts this institution from reflecting both democratic and economic values more and more to purely economic values, undermining its capacity to serve citizens. Examples illustrating this argument are explored.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Utilizing Frantz Fanon’s major writings and ideas, and other commentaries on Fanon’s work, this paper aims to expose the problem of achieving genuine development outside the dominant neoliberal paradigm. According to the government of Zimbabwe, the aim of their indigenization program is to achieve authentic national development and decolonization from British and European imperial control. By unmasking the contradictory nature of elite nationalism and the decolonization process in Zimbabwe, the paper unmasks the complexity of development outside the dominant Euro-America (corporate capitalist) paradigm. I consider the Zimbabwe case as an example of elite nationalists domesticating the neoliberal market system to achieve selfish economic aggrandizement while the rest of the population experience immizerating poverty. The emergence of the indigenous bourgeoisie among many other developments represents the ultimate fulfillment of Fanon’s prophecy. The paper argues for epistemological refocusing to achieve meaningful development and genuine decolonization.","[{""country"":[""Zimbabwe""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The removability of parents obviously places the citizen children in the unfortunate position of having to leave their country of citizenship behind to accompany the parents, or arrange for living situations within the United States, perhaps with a relative, but be separated from their parents. The compelling interests raised by the removability of parents in such circumstances have given rise to distinct forms of relief under domestic legal systems. The United Kingdom, in a recent decision by its Supreme Court, has held that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in determining whether the removal of the parent would be proportionate. Likewise, the United States provides for certain types of relief from removal for the parents of United States citizen children. Yet neither regime is entirely satisfactory. The United Kingdom’s approach is unduly biased towards non-removability, whereas the standards for establishing relief from removal in the United States are onerous and will be rarely met in practice. The purpose of this article is to propose a balancing of the interests that takes a realistic look both at the compelling interest citizen children have to remain in their country as part of a family unit and the competing interests of the state in a fully and fairly functioning immigration system. Such balancing is liable to make all parties unhappy - not every non-citizen parent should be permitted to remain simply on the fact of that parentage, and, conversely, not every removable parent should be removed simply because they are present illegally - yet it is the only feasible option to a problem that is only likely to grow in the coming decades.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"
