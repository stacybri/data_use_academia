Opening B-share markets may result in improved transactional efficiency, yet this is not equivalent to improved informational efficiency. We find that after market opening, B-share price movements become more synchronous and firm-specific return variations are reduced. Opening B-share markets to domestic investors does not improve information capitalization of B share prices, as reflected by increased price synchronicity and reduced idiosyncratic risk.

The Institute of International Education (2012) reports that a lack of funding to public universities has increased their reliance on the revenue provided by international students while private universities also seek to bolster their position in the face of increased international competition. The importance of international students in under-enrolled majors, their necessity as a vital revenue stream for universities and the challenges faced by both student and host university are also discussed. The author provides recommendations for improving the educational experience of international students through improved relationships with university constituents in order to maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of the U.S. as a preferred place of study.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

And if both prosodic representation and performance constraints conspire to cause a speaker to divide a sentence into two units, can the durational effects that result be parsed into those two different sources? In this chapter, we argue that prosody and performance are theoretically and empirically distinct, and that durational effects may arise from two distinct sources: from the implementation of a grammatical representation, and from performance limitations. A range of empirical evidence is presented to support this distinction. Studies investigating the effects of working memory, inhibitory control, and lexical difficulty indicate that individuals with less cognitive capacity are more likely to produce sentence-internal breaks, and these are not conditioned by characteristics of a prosodic representation. This finding suggests that performance units are not necessarily prosodic units, and that an adequate theory of sentence production must incorporate mechanisms for implementing prosodic structure as well as strategies for managing processing load during speech.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, click rates on display advertisements average only 0.1 percent. Are low click rates evidence that display advertisements have no impact on consumer behavior? Or, does display advertising work in a manner similar to traditional “branding” advertising, with multiple exposures being required to effect a change in consumer behavior? This article shows that the click is not an accurate indicator of the effectiveness of online display advertisements. Even when click rates are minimal, display advertisements can generate meaningful increases in site visitation, trademark search, and both online and offline sales.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Previously we showed that POX catalyzed the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is freqeuently associated with mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. As an important antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutases (SOD) may interfere with the POX-dependent induction of apoptosis. In this study, we used DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells stably transfected with the POX gene under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. When doxcycline was removed from the culture medium and the expression of POX was induced, apoptotic cell death was initiated. To examine the importance of the ROS-dependent component of the pathway, we infected DLD-POX cells with recombinant adenoviruses containing MnSOD, CuZnSOD, catalase, or varying combinations of these adenoviruses followed by induced expression of POX. The expression of MnSOD dramatically inhibited POX-induced apoptosis. Compared with control cells, MnSOD-expressing DLD-POX cells generated higher concentration of H2O2 due to dismutation of superoxide radicals. These cells also expressed higher level of phospho-p38 MAPK concomitant to generation of H2O2. Thus, these data further confirm that POX-induced apoptosis is due to the generation of ROS (probably superoxide radicals), and the process is blocked by MnSOD. In addition, activation of p38 MAPK may play a role in the blockade of POX-induced apoptosis by MnSOD.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Page","This article reviews two books: Rulemaking, Participation and the Limits of Public Law in the USA and Europe by Theodora Th. Ziamou and Governing by Numbers by Edward C. Page. In Rulemaking, Ziamou compares the law of rulemaking in the United States, Germany, Greece, and England. Ziamou covers the distinction between administrative rules and other administrative acts, the constitutional law of rulemaking, rulemaking procedure, the ability of private organizations to adopt rules that bind themselves and third parties, and judicial review. Readers are left with a better understanding of American and European rulemaking but may not be convinced that Europe has a problem or that the American system is any better. Governing by Numbers is also about rulemaking in Europe, specifically Great Britain, but this book addresses the very different perspective of qualitative political science. Page focuses on rules, known in Britain as delegated legislation or statutory instruments. By doing so, he studies the broader phenomenon of what he calls “everyday politics,” that is, matters that do not mobilize political parties and cause partisan debate in Parliament and the press, but are nevertheless significant. Page concludes that the government dominates both high politics and everyday politics; however, junior ministers, low-level civil servants, and highly specialized lobbying groups are politics’ most important players.","[{""country"":[""Germany"",""Greece"",""United Kingdom"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The Norwegian results were compared to findings in Canada, Italy, Switzerland, and USA. The ALL-data presented indicate that in all of these countries, females in general are less likely than males to state that they are good with numbers and calculations. The gender differences in mathematical self-concept were largest within Switzerland and Norway.

Thus a price of zero would be economicallyefficient for consumers. However, zero revenues would eliminate the economic incentives for creating such goods in the first place. We develop a novel mechanism which tries to solve this dilemma by decoupling the price of digital goods from the payments to innovators while maintaining budget balance and incentive compatibility. Specifically, by selling digital goods via large bundles the marginal price for consuming an additional good can be made zero for most consumers. Thus efficiency is enhanced. Meanwhile, we show how statistical sampling can be combined with tiered coupons to reveal the individual demands for each of the component goods in such a bundle. This makes it possible to provide accurate payments to creators which spurs further innovation. In our analysis of the proposed mechanism, we find that it can operate with an efficiency loss of less than 0.1% of the efficiency loss of the traditional price-based system. It is not surprising to find that innovation incentives in our mechanism are improved relative to the zero-price approach often favored by content consumers. However, it is surprising to find that the incentives are also substantially better than those provided by the traditional system based on excludability and monopoly pricing which is often favored by content owners. The technology and legal framework for our proposed mechanism already exist, the key issues of implementing it are organizational. ∗Brynjolfsson: MIT Sloan School of Management and MIT Center for Digital Business (erik@mit.edu).

However, very little is known about whether or how corporate social responsibility affects employees. Because employees are primary stakeholders who directly contribute to the success of the company, understanding employee reactions to corporate social responsibility may help answer lingering questions about the potential effects of corporate social responsibility on firms as well as illuminate some of the processes responsible for them. To begin our chapter, we provide a brief history of scholarship on corporate social responsibility and highlight some of the major challenges researchers in this area currently face. We then discuss why corporate social responsibility may represent a special opportunity to influence employees’ general impression of their company. Next, we identify four distinct paths through which corporate social responsibility may affect employees’ relationship with their company that correspond to four universal psychological needs: security, self-esteem, belongingness, and a meaningful existence. Finally, we offer an agenda for micro-level research on corporate social responsibility. # 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem is found in a wide variety of scenarios ranging from drivers who leave keys in cars that are stolen, to social hosts whose intoxicated guests drive home, to gun manufacturers who market in ways that arguably render their guns more available for criminal misuse. Building on Robert Rabin’s idea of “enabling torts,” the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm adopts an aggressive strategy for dealing with this problem: it denies that there really is a problem. Claims against remote actors, it says, require no different treatment than claims against those who cause injury without intervening wrongdoing. In this contribution to a symposium on the Restatement’s Physical and Emotional Harm provisions, we demonstrate that the Reporters’ proposed approach runs afoul of numerous well-established doctrines that limit remote-actor liability while unjustifiably glossing over the actual grounds on which courts allow for the imposition of liability on remote actors. We then lay out an alternative framework for assessing remote actor liability that is truer to doctrine, more workable for judges, and more in keeping with the nature of tort as a law of wrongs and recourse.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Since the problems to be addressed are all location specified critical points for bio-energy generation, GIS maps are used to identify the locations and the associated attainable volumes of agricultural waste. Meanwhile, reasonable variation and distribution of attainable cotton gin waste was identified by using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation. Consequently, the constrained expected profit maximization model was specified to assess the optimal plant size, application of technologies and associated production outputs under multiple scenarios of market situations. Conclusions based on the study results include that the possibility of peaking power contact for bio-energy outputs is critical for taking advantage of larger scales of bio-energy production, reducing the production risk and enhancing the competitiveness of bio-energy products. Gasifying biomass is a feasible way to generate electricity for peak load needs while satisfying self consumption and incidental sale if necessary facilities connecting to the grid are available. Mobile pyrolysis plants have sufficient potential for profits all the way through effectively converting biomass to bio-oil, hence increasing the feasibility of a large-scale bio-energy facility and the capability to meet the needs of higher valued peaking power by utilizing an existing facility at local power plants in the study region. Also, the study results imply that production of bio-energy from agricultural waste has higher risks, and the variance of profits could be immense even though at a typical area with heavy concentrations of agricultural production. Technology improvement associated with reduced expenses for plant facilities or the increased converting efficiency would be the key components for dealing the risk and commercializing bio-energy products in long term.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Gastric mucosal lesions were induced by taurocholic acid (TCA) which was given through a gastric tube. Levels of phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, and disaturated-phosphatidylcholine were found to be markedly reduced at the mucosal surface in the cirrhotic rats, and they were increased in the gastric juice. Metabolism of phospholipids in the gastric mucosa was visualized by 3H-choline autoradiography and the rate of phospholipid metabolism was found to be reduced. These results strongly suggest that mucosal lesions induced by bile regurgitation into the stomach are due to disturbance of phospholipid metabolism in the gastric mucosa.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A comprehensive analysis and a mathematical framework are used to assess the sustainability indexes (SDIs) of each aspect/issue and pillar/dimension, and of the whole manufacturing enterprise. Sustainability in the whole manufacturing enterprise is represented by the sustainable development index (SDI). The results show that there is a significant difference in SDIs between aspects and dimensions, with economic sustainability representing the highest percentage in the SDI. Also, the results show that industrial companies are adopting sustainable practices and applying them to most of the issues/aspects of the dimensions, and they can direct manufacturing companies in the industrial sector to develop strategies for sustainability. This paper introduces a new understanding of the practices and implementation of sustainability/sustainable development by SMEs through assessing the SDIs.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We examine the women’s experiences through the everyday encouragers and discouragers that they encounter in these programs. We are especially interested in the small discouragers that occur daily and accumulate to the point that a woman decides that pursuing the doctoral degree is no longer worth it. A unique component of the current research program is our attention to the special circumstances that apply to women in engineering and the physical sciences where their numbers are already low and the enrollment of international students is substantial. In addition to reviewing national findings, we have used focus groups at Arizona State University to enrich our understanding of the everyday experience of domestic women and international women in the target programs. This paper highlights issues that have emerged from the focus group discussions of domestic and international doctoral women in engineering and computer science. Our aim is to better understand the role of national and cultural influences on what women experience and how they respond. We describe some of the commonalities and differences between domestic and international women with respect to their perceptions of everyday encouragers and discouragers and how they cope with them. In a broader context, we consider how these experiences may contribute to their intentions to complete their doctoral programs. We also discuss possible interventions and support that can be given to help retain discouraged female doctoral students who consider leaving their programs. Finally, we suggest areas for additional research to help us better understand both the domestic and the international woman doctoral student in engineering and computer science.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Politicians with college degrees do not tend to govern over more prosperous nations, do not pass more bills, do not tend to do better at the polls, and are no less likely to be corrupt.

These systems serve as a vital asset to any organization and hence it becomes mandatory to ensure their security. In the present scenario these services are offered on the cloud mainly to reduce inherent risk associated with the traditional enterprise systems. Cloud computing represents a significant shift in the way that IT resources are managed, operated, and consumed. This change exposes several benefits to enterprises, promoting greater IT efficiency and agility. This paper is intended to suggest a theoretical basis for studying the factors that influence SMEs’ adoption of cloud computing. It will first explain the integration between the Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE). Based on this technology innovation adoption process is influenced by three aspects of an enterprise’s context. The technological context represents the internal and external technologies related to the organisation, both technologies that are already in use at the firm, as well as those that are available in the marketplace but not currently in use .These technologies may include either equipment or practice. The organisational context is related to the resources and the characteristics of the firm, e.g. size and managerial structure, while, finally, the environmental context refers to the arena in which a firm conducts its business; it can be related to surrounding elements such as industry, competitors and the presence of technology service providers. Enterprise Systems help in carrying out various tasks with greater operational efficiency and reliability. They also facilitate to keep information updated and available across the organization 24 * 7. As enablers of successful business reengineering projects, they help the organizations to save money, keep their business data consistent, current and available, speed up business processes, and improve the quality and reliability of the processes.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The paper presents a preliminary explanation of why the labor market and poverty impact of the current stagflation may be far smaller than projected in recent studies, especially for the rural economy. The main conclusions that emerge are that (1) The overwhelming expected negative impact of low economic growth, high double-digit inflation, and crippling energy shortages on poverty and the labor market appear to have been cushioned by the large increase in remittances, rising wages in agriculture and services, and social safety nets; (2) there is, however, no reason for complacency since over 20 million people live in absolute poverty and that the economy remains in deep stagflation, (3) the PSLM (HIES) 2010/11 data should be made publicly available so that it can be subject to more critical analysis and (4) studies on poverty should be based on a close integration of macro-sectoral–micro-factors to fully capture the underlying “poverty dynamics.”","[{""country"":[""Pakistan""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

J. Phys. Chem. B2009, 113, 12988-12998). For all studied fluids, the spherically symmetric CG potential constructed according to our scheme modified in this work balances the reproduction of various equilibrium properties (i.e., structural and thermodynamic) measured in CG simulations. The inherent loss of atomistic information at the CG level correlates with the contribution from short-range directional interactions. The highest loss of atomistic information at 298 K and 1 bar is reported for protic liquids (i.e., methanol and acetamide), while the best description at the CG level was obtained for molecular hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The investigated aprotic liquids (i.e., benzene, toluene, and acetone) can be CG into spherically symmetric interaction potentials with some loss of atomistic details. Interestingly, we show that the proposed optimal CG potential reproduces also the interfacial properties of vapor-liquid coexistence for aprotic benzene at 298 K. For all studied fluids, we find that one can easily reproduce structural properties without preserving their cohesive properties or vice versa. However, a general conclusion from our study is the following: an increase in the protic character of a fluid leads to an increase of inherent loss of atomistic details at the CG level.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Furthermore, agriculture is the main income basis of local farmers; especially, in Northeast Thailand, the ratio of irrigated agricultural land was only 7.6%, and others were rainfed so that climate change makes agricultural production increasingly unstable and inflicts serious damages on the societies and economies of rural areas. In this study, we focused on weather-induced economic damages of upland crops, such as sugarcane and cassava. Firstly, we evaluated the effect of the seasonal rainfall amount and pattern on upland crop yields through correlation analysis using meteorological and agricultural statistical data. The sugarcane yield had a significant positive relationship with 4 months of accumulated rainfall. The cassava yield had a significant negative relationship with 5 months of accumulated rainfall. Secondly, a household survey was conducted to grasp the farmers’ conditions of water use, cultivation, income balance, etc. The average household income was 341,160 Baht/year, 122,433 Baht/year derived from agriculture and 218,727 Baht/year from non-agricultural work. The variation in farmers’ income in each province by crop changing was evaluated using interview results. For farmers’ livelihood, a monoculture system should be avoided because of the system’s normally high risk and its vulnerability. As a result of analysis, mixed farming of sugarcane and cassava is recommended to stabilize farming incomes both in flood and in drought years.","[{""country"":[""Thailand""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Survival post-LTx is hampered by the development of the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and diagnosis is often late. Given the urgent clinical need to recognize BOS patients at an early stage, we analyzed circulating miRNAs to identify possible stratification markers for BOS development post-transplantation. Therefore, pro-fibrotic (miR-21, miR-155), anti-fibrotic (miR-29a) and fibrosis-unrelated (miR-103, miR-191) miRNAs were analyzed in serum of end-stage lung disease patients and during LTx follow-up. Significant elevated levels of serum miRNAs were observed for all investigated miRNAs in both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease patients compared to healthy controls. The same miRNAs were also significantly increased in the serum of BOS + vs. BOS − patients. Most importantly, miR-21, miR-29a, miR-103, and miR-191 levels were significantly higher in BOS + patients prior to clinical BOS diagnosis. We demonstrated that a selected group of miRNAs investigated is elevated in end-stage lung disease and BOS + patients, prior to clinical BOS diagnosis. Even if further research is expedient on the prognostic value of circulating miRNAs in BOS and lung conditions in general, these results strongly suggest that circulating miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for BOS development.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is expected that certain mechanisms will be developed in order to overcome this information asymmetry. One of those mechanisms is signalling, whose basic idea is that highly productive workers take certain actions in order to separate themselves from the low productive workers. This paper reviews an economic role of education as a signal in the labour market. The goal of the paper is to show theoretically how education can play the role of signal in order to solve the problems caused by the asymmetric information. The importance of such analysis is reflected in the fact that the recommendations for educational policy makers in terms of investment in education are different depending on whether education serves as a mechanism for improving productivity or as a mechanism for signalling different productive capacity. It is shown that these differences arise from distinct ways of measuring social rates of return on investment in education.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Information security policy compliance is one of the main challenges facing organisations today. Although implementing technical and procedural measures clearly helps to improve an organisation's information security, the human factor or the employees' compliance with these measures is the key to success. However, organisations are now having some issues regarding the extent of employee adherence to policy. The problem of employees being unaware or ignorant of their responsibilities in relation to information security is still an open issue. The proposed idea in this paper will seek to enhance end user adherence to information security policies by proposing a framework for security policy compliance monitoring and targeted awareness raising. The foremost aim of this framework is to increase users’ awareness of the importance of following information security policies. Continuously subjecting users to targeted awareness and monitoring their adherence to information security policies should enhance the effectiveness of such awareness efforts. The proposed framework is a part of on-going research and is intended to provide a foundation for future research on a dynamic adaption of users’ behaviour with information security policies.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We compared 25 patients who had undergone LRGB 11 +/- 3 months previously with 30 obese controls matched for age, gender, and menopausal status. Compared with obese controls, patients post LRGB had significantly lower weight (92 +/- 16 vs. 133 +/- 20 kg; P < 0.001) and body mass index (31 +/- 5 vs. 48 +/- 7 kg/m(2); P < 0.001). Markers of bone turnover were significantly elevated in patients post LRGB compared with controls (urinary N-telopeptide cross-linked collagen type 1, 93 +/- 38 vs. 24 +/- 11 nmol bone collagen equivalents per mmol creatinine; and osteocalcin, 11.6 +/- 3.4 vs. 7.6 +/- 3.6 ng/ml; both P < 0.001). Fifteen patients were studied prospectively for an average of 9 months after LRGB. They lost 37 +/- 9 kg and had a 29 +/- 8% fall in body mass index (both P < 0.001). Urinary N-telopeptide cross-linked collagen type 1 increased by 174 +/- 168% at 3 months (P < 0.01) and 319 +/- 187% at 9 months (P < 0.01). Bone mineral density decreased significantly at the total hip (7.8 +/- 4.8%; P < 0.001), trochanter (9.3 +/- 5.7%; P < 0.001), and total body (1.6 +/- 2.0%; P < 0.05), with significant decreases in bone mineral content at these sites. In summary, within 3 to 9 months after LRGB, morbidly obese patients have an increase in bone resorption associated with a decrease in bone mass. Additional studies are needed to examine these findings over the longer term.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Does it always represent (positively perceived) knowledge transfer or can it sometimes constitute (negatively perceived) intra-corporate plagiarism? What are antecedents and consequences of negatively perceived mobility of ideas? ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Design/methodology/approach ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: The authors conceptualise inter-unit knowledge transfer in MNCs without recognition of originators as an act of intra-corporate plagiarism. The conceptualisation is informed by theoretical perspectives in the literature and indicative data emerging unexpectedly from a study designed to examine knowledge transfer in MNCs. These illustrate the concept, point to factors affecting the propensity to plagiarise, and provide preliminary insight on both negative and positive consequences. Aiming to build theory, the authors offer propositions for further research. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Findings ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: The conceptualisation suggests that adopting units lose access to the original sources of ideas as plagiarism victims may establish defensive strategies. Originators of ideas may experience loss of trust, be unsupportive of implementation and erect barriers to future mobility. There is risk of reputation loss and rejection of ideas and practices from other units. However, the conceptualisation also suggests that, ironically and counterintuitively, plagiarism may increase the mobility of ideas within MNCs. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Research limitations/implications ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: The authors do not test hypotheses and make no claims from the data about statistical validity or prevalence of the phenomenon. As the emergent data are not longitudinal, and specific to human resource management practices, the authors cannot empirically establish all antecedents and consequences of intra-corporate plagiarism. Hence, the theorisations primarily rely on perspectives in the literature. The study merely offers the theoretical conceptualisation of the phenomenon and propositions for future research. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Practical implications ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Drawing on theoretical perspectives in the literature at the country level (ethnocentrism, dominance effects, legitimacy, capability) and organisation level (not-invented-here syndrome, micro-politics), the study indicates consequences that MNCs may wish to consider in their knowledge management. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Originality/value ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: The first contribution is the conceptualisation of inter-unit knowledge transfer in MNCs without recognition of originators as an act of intra-corporate plagiarism. Second, the authors point out that knowledge transfer directionality reported in other research may be based on intentional or unintentional misrepresentation. Third, the authors theorise intra-corporate plagiarism as potentially useful in mitigating ethnocentrism, country-of-origin dominance effects and perceptions about legitimacy and capability.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The use of strategies in learning vocabulary has been proven to have a significant impact on the process of learning vocabulary. Nevertheless, it was found that advance learning is insufficient, and the digitization era requires more words to be mastered to have clear communication. Hence, this research aims to discover the strategies used among engineering majors in learning engineering terminology. This research employed mixed methods consisting of both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The instruments of this research are, a vocabulary learning strategies questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The questionnaires were administered to 150 students majoring in engineering from five engineering clusters. This research found that engineering students employed determination and metacognitive strategies most frequently. The most frequently used strategy was found to be listening and watching English media while the least frequently used strategy was keeping a vocabulary notebook. Findings show that future communication should focus on interactivity of the media used to increase the proficiency of technical vocabulary and the Malaysian government can drive industry 4.0 though strategies identified in this study.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A debate exists as to how ISO 9000 impacts trade. First, it has been argued that ISO 9000 is a ""common language"" that lowers information asymmetries between firms, thus, allowing more efficient organization of inter-firm trade. Second, ISO 9000 has been criticized as a means of introducing market-entry barriers and a tariff on international trade. To assess the actual impact we estimate a gravity equation for bilateral exports incorporating ISO 9000 adoptions in each country as factors affecting bilateral trade barriers. Endogeneity issues are carefully addressed. To obtain additional insights, we separately estimate an ISO 9000 international diffusion equation. In general, our results support the ""common language"" hypothesis, i.e., the empirical tests find both domestic and foreign ISO 9000 adoptions to benefit bilateral exports. Moreover, we find evidence for a substitution effect, as ISO 9000 certified firms tend to trade with each other more than with uncertified firms. Consequently, the positive impact of these standards on trade is more pronounced among ISO 9000 abundant countries.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Intermediate goods are produced under monopolistic competition and final good production exhibits increasing returns with respect to the number of varieties of intermediates. Pollution occurs in the production of the final good when polluting intermediates are used. We analyze the effects of international trade in intermediate products on pollution, output and welfare under an endogenous tax scenario and with two types of pollution functions. The results show that, because of increasing returns, international trade either leads to lower total pollution in each country or lower pollution per unit of output in at least one country. In addition, intra-industry trade causes countries to import the environmental quality of their trading partners.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Indeed, this view is so widely held that modern legal scholarship takes it for granted. Articles on general federalism issues use medical malpractice as an easy example of a policy in which federal intervention lacks functional justification, and articles that focus on federalization of other tort reforms use medical malpractice as an easy foil, pointing out that the uniformity interest that justifies federalized products liability law, for example, does not apply to medical malpractice law. But this conventional view fails to take account of the impact that existing federal healthcare programs have on the states' incentives to regulate. The federal government finances a significant portion of American healthcare, both directly through spending programs like Medicare and Medicaid and indirectly through tax subsidies like the exemption for employer-sponsored insurance. As a result of these federal expenditures, each state externalizes some of the costs of its malpractice policy choices onto the federal government, even while internalizing the benefits of those choices. The federal government thus needs to play at least some role in medical malpractice reform in order to fix the spillover problem created by existing federal healthcare programs. Importantly, the need for federal intervention in medical malpractice arises solely from the federal government's prior decisions to pay a portion of healthcare spending. Unlike traditional spillover stories, the story here is not that the states are inevitably ill-suited to govern medical malpractice; rather, the federal government has made them so. That is, the federal government's prior interventions in healthcare spending have snowballed into a need for federalization of medical malpractice. This causal distinction between spillover stories and ""snowball"" stories bears theoretical and practical significance for functional models of federalism, and it has the potential to explain and justify federalization decisions in a wide range of regulatory regimes.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Material and Methods The study was conducted on a tertiary craniofacial center and comprised retrospective analysis of panoramic and periapical radiographs of Caucasoid individuals with non-syndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate, analyzing all radiographs available on the records of each individual, from the first to the last up to 12 years of age. Overall, 2,826 records were reviewed to achieve a sample of 1,000 individuals. Among these, 487 individuals presented the permanent lateral incisors on both cleft and non-cleft sides, which were included in this study. Results The results were evaluated in percentages and by descriptive statistics. The association between maintenance of the lateral incisor and timing of alveolar bone graft were analyzed by the t test. Among the 487 individuals, 265 had not completed treatment, 62 presented insufficient information, and 44 concluded the treatment elsewhere. Among the remaining 116 individuals, the lateral incisor was extracted from 88 (75.86%) of them on the cleft side (CS) and from 23 (19.83%) people on the non-cleft side (NCS). The age at accomplishment of alveolar bone graft was significantly associated with maintenance of the lateral incisor on the cleft side (p<0.01). Most extractions were indicated because of the inadequate positioning on the CS and for midline correction on the NCS. Rehabilitation was primarily completed by orthodontic movement (53 individuals on the CS and 13 individuals on the NCS). Conclusion In conclusion, the lateral incisor on the cleft side was not maintained in most individuals. Positive relationship was observed between extraction of the lateral incisor and age at accomplishment of the alveolar bone graft, suggesting the need to anticipate the initial radiographic evaluation to enhance its maintenance and reduce the procedures required for rehabilitation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Initial PRO-CTCAE symptoms were chosen through 1) medical record audit 2) patient interviews 3) summary of product characteristics from European Medicines Agency and Food and Drug Administration for the applied chemotherapies, and 4) toxicity reporting from Phase 2 and 3 trials for immunotherapies applied in patients with urothelial cancer. The selected questions were applied in a prospective cohort of 78 bladder cancer patients receiving chemo- or immunotherapy at Rigshospitalet and Herlev Hospital, Denmark. Symptoms tested in this population were selected for the final module if they appeared in ≥3 of the following groupings a) the most prevalent PRO-CTCAE symptoms grade ≥ 2 overall during treatment b) the PRO-CTCAE symptoms reported in conjunction with hospital admissions or mentioned in focus group interviews discussing which symptoms were prevalent in this patient group with specialized c) nurses or d) physicians. The authors also included symptoms in the final module if they were present in two of the above groups and defined as actionable by clinicians. From the initial selection of PRO-CTCAE symptoms, a total of 45 PRO-CTCAE symptoms explored by 84 PRO-CTCAE questions were retrieved. Through the second selection process based on the described criteria, the study group agreed on 15 PRO-CTCAE symptoms explored by 30 PRO-CTCAE items to be appropriate and relevant for the bladder population during medical oncological treatment. The selection of disease specific PROs in a bladder cancer population was feasible. The process revealed several steps of selection needed in order to reach a final module for clinical application.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study examines the influence of the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund‐Global (NGPF‐G), on employment in its U.K. investee firms. We find that firms with NGPF‐G investment are significantly less likely to reduce their demand for labour, more specifically in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. When a drop in the demand for labour does occur, it is less extreme when compared to similar organisations without a NGPF‐G shareholding, and this is evident even in the case of relatively small NGPF‐G investments. These findings are in line with the fund's objective of promoting corporate sustainability and Norwegian values. We draw out the key implications of our findings for HR practice.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We use a high-dimensional nonlinear non-Gaussian state space model to estimate common components in firm defaults in a 22-country sample covering six broad industry sectors and four economic regions in the world. The results indicate that common world factors are a first order source of default risk volatility and default clustering, and that shared exposure to world factors limit the scope of cross-border credit risk diversification for global lenders. Deviations of credit risk conditions from macro fundamentals are correlated with bank lending standards in all regions, suggesting that credit supply and systematic default risk conditions are inversely related. Contrary to intuition, we demonstrate that crossborder credit risk diversification can increase portfolio risk.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The same generation of workers established one of the first attempts in Australia to organise working people including but beyond their workplaces, at the community level, by forming the Illawarra District Council of the Australian Labour Federation in 1896, which tried to combine industrial and political activities in one organisation in the one community.1 The history of unions in regional Australia is the story of their existence in the community.1 Historians and sociologists have captured some of this and in this paper, in seeking to answer the question ‘what do unions do that make them successful parts of their communities?—I have reviewed the now quite substantial literature on regional unionism covering Broken Hill, Bulli, Lithgow, Newcastle, the Pilbara, Port Kembla, Wagga Wagga, Wollongong and Wonthaggi.

Four research questions were raised and one hypothesis was formulated and tested at 0.05 level of significance. The data collected were subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistics. The results of the analysis revealed that both multiple-choice and short answer objective test had better internal consistency of 0.78 and 0.73 respectively using Cronbach’s Alpha while Spearman Brown split half had good internal consistency in both multiple-choice (0.80) and short answer (0.81) than Cronbach’s Alpha method. It was also revealed that there was significant difference between the performance of students in multiple-choice and short answer objective test format. Despite the fact that multiple-choice objective test is commonly used the short answer test format is still reliable in measuring students understanding of principles and ability in solving technological problems.

There have been conflicting reports on the use of intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate for prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of sodium bicarbonate for prevention of CI-AKI. Methods. This is a symptomatic review and meta-analysis of prospectively randomized studies, abstracts and manuscripts, published from 1950 to 20 February 2009. Results. Of 192 identified publications, 18 studies (n = 3055) were included. Nine studies were only published as an abstract. CI-AKI occurred in 11.6%. Six prospective studies demonstrated that intervention with sodium bicarbonate resulted in a decreased risk of CI-AKI. The aggregate result of the prospective trials also demonstrated a benefit favouring sodium bicarbonate (RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.45–0.95). This effect was most prominent in coronary procedures and in patients with chronic kidney disease. There was no effect on need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mortality. Published manuscripts demonstrated a beneficial effect, while abstracts could not. Also, funnel plot analysis suggested a publication bias. In addition, we found significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity between studies. Finally, the quality of the individual studies was limited. Conclusions. The incidence of CI-AKI was higher than recently reported, and varied among study cohorts. We found a preventive effect of the use of sodium bicarbonate on the risk for CI-AKI, however, with borderline statistical significance. There was no effect on need for RRT or mortality. The relative low quality of the individual studies, heterogeneity and possible publication bias means that only a limited recommendation can be made in favour of the use of sodium bicarbonate.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In terms of access to credit, seen through extent of indebtedness, Karnataka is better placed than many Indian states. But Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Kerala lie ahead of Karnataka. Ironically however, almost half of the credit is still provided by the informal sector in the state of Karnataka (on an average). Region wise picture shows that Southern region is more dependent on informal sources of credit. Poor farmers with lower land holdings are much more deprived of the formal sources of credit than the comparatively richer ones. Thus they also pay a much higher rate of interest with modal value of 36%. But it is heartening to note that loans are taken mostly for income generating purposes. It also indirectly implies that even for the income generating purposes poor are not getting access to formal sources of credit.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A key component of monitoring conduct within this area is Financial Services Compliance Management. Financial institutions need to adhere to legislation such as the European MiFID II and GDPR through to anti-money laundering compliance. A recent report by Thomson Routers in 2018 has found through a survey with 800 financial firms that 66% of firms expect the cost of senior compliance staff to increase, up from 60% of firms in 2017, indicating a continuing growth in spending on compliance. Effective solutions need to be in place to mitigate these increasing costs while enhancing the compliance workflow. Doing this would provide a market edge. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been gaining traction within the compliance management domain from both regulators and financial institutions in areas such as trade and market surveillance to regulatory compliance assurance. These areas share a commonality in terms of the volume of data to monitor often in real-time and from disparate sources both structured and unstructured with an emphasis on ensuring data quality and handling underlying bias in data. In this paper, an overview of the key use case areas of AI and ML in the compliance management domain will be provided. Detailed analysis on the application of specific AI solutions such as natural language processing, data discovery and generative modelling is introduced.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As anticipated educationally optimal instructional design was appreciated by academics and students, however, it was not the most significant aspect in influencing students’ perceptions of ‘good’ or effective teaching. Differences were found between two teaching academics’ beliefs about students and these translated into varied approaches to teaching, interactions with students, and different capacities to establish positive classroom environments and relationships. Academics’ ethic of care and relational acumen were the pivotal components in students’ criteria for effective teaching, which may present a quandary to academic developers. Findings indicate the importance of relational acumen and an ethic of care and may also have significance for university leaders in matching academic teaching activities to faculty strengths and potentially explaining negative student feedback in well-designed units.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The main aim of the article is to assess foresight maturity of companies based in Podlaskie province in Poland as one of the least developed regions in Europe. The survey research is preceded by bibliometric analysis and literature review to examine current tendencies in foresight research in organisations. The conclusions drawn from the analysis of the existing works on organizational foresight are that foresight is no longer referred to only as a portfolio of methodologies through which organizations may garner a broader vision and probe the future to ascertain potential competitive landscapes but also as a human or organisational competence. Therefore, the research is based on a foresight maturity model developed by Grim (J Futur Stud 13(4):69–80, 2009). The model, besides traditionally associated foresight components such as environmental scanning, takes into consideration such aspects as leadership, collective vision building, and planning. Pilot survey research carried out among 134 production and services enterprises based in the Podlaskie region has allowed us to state that the companies are characterised by low foresight maturity levels. Hence, based on a literature review, two management concepts are suggested as means to increase the level of foresight maturity in companies.","[{""country"":[""Poland""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We descriptively analyzed whether differences in the functions of spontaneous speech derived from Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (A-B-C) analysis are related to the T-scores for response inhibition (“Inhibit”) and attentional flexibility (“Shift”) of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) profiles of children with ASD. Methods: Three children with ASD participated in this pilot case study. The BRIEF was used as a measure of executive function (EF). Spontaneous speech of all participants was recorded and classified into five categories: antecedent control of self (ACS), consequent control of self (CCS), antecedent control of others (ACO), consequent control of others (CCO), and exception (EXP). Results: The T-score for “Shift” of all participants exceeded a previously defined cut-off value. Spontaneous speech associated with “control of self” was not observed in any participant, while that associated with “control of others” varied among individuals. The participant with the highest frequency of spontaneous speech had the lowest “Shift” T-score, while the participant with the least active spontaneous speech had the highest “Shift” T-score. Conclusions: Our results suggest a potential association between spontaneous speech and a shift in executive function in children with ASD.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Conflict is a serious state, which is often prolonged and arises from incompatibility or divergent interests and values. However, conflict may also be used as a productive force for change. Conflict has been included as a core competence for healthcare professionals in a number of competency frameworks because of the recognition that inter- and intra-professional conflict affect patient safety and outcomes, as well as having detrimental effects on staff morale, and on physical and mental health. We discuss how conflict may arise from several triggers – personal, professional and organisational. In particular, disparities in values may lead to conflict, while good communication is fundamental to optimal practice. The history of the development of the health professions includes many examples of conflict between professional groups. A healthy practice environment should encourage constructive conflict management, recognising that conflict will always arise. Early experiences of working and learning together represent important learning opportunities for students, enabling the development and practice of teamwork skills, as well as helping them to recognise and understand the different values, perspectives, roles and responsibilities of team members. Learning opportunities based on real-life scenarios and patient experiences provide a focus common to all professional groups, allowing students the opportunity to explore their differences and similarities. The key messages are: conflict occurs frequently in practice-based settings both inter- and intra-professionally, and learners need to be able to recognise and deal with conflict, including through negotiation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Diagnosis is currently based on behavioral criteria, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is increasingly used in ADHD research. To date however, MRI studies have provided mixed results in ADHD patients, particularly with respect to the laterality of findings. Methods:We studied 849 children and adolescents (ages 6-21 y.o.) diagnosed with ADHD (n = 341) and age-matched typically developing (TD) controls with structural brain MRI. We calculated volumetric measures from 34 cortical and 14 non-cortical brain regions per hemisphere, and detailed shape morphometry of subcortical nuclei. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected for a subset of 104 subjects; from these, we calculated mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts. Group comparisons were made for within-hemisphere (right/left) and between hemisphere asymmetry indices (AI) for each measure. Results:DTI mean diffusivity AI group differences were significant in cingulum, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cortico-spinal tracts (p < 0.001) with the effect of stimulant treatment tending to reduce these patterns of asymmetry differences. Gray matter volumes were more asymmetric in medication free ADHD individuals compared to TD in twelve cortical regions and two non-cortical volumes studied (p < 0.05). Morphometric analyses revealed that caudate, hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala were more asymmetric (p < 0.0001) in ADHD individuals compared to TD, and that asymmetry differences were more significant than lateralized comparisons. Conclusions:Brain asymmetry measures allow each individual to serve as their own control, diminishing variability between individuals and when pooling data across sites. Asymmetry group differences were more significant than lateralized comparisons between ADHD and TD subjects across morphometric, volumetric, and DTI comparisons.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Here, we investigated repeated migratory journeys of a long-distance migrating bird, the marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus, in order to analyse the variation within and between individuals with respect to routes and timing. We found that there was a stronger individual repeatability in time than in space. Thus, the annual timing of migration varied much less between repeated journeys of the same individual than between different individuals, while there was considerable variation in the routes of the same individual on repeated journeys. The overall contrast in repeatability between time and space was unexpected and may be owing to strong endogenous control of timing, while short-term variation in environmental conditions (weather and habitat) might promote route flexibility. The individual variation in migration routes indicates that the birds navigate mainly by other means than detailed route recapitulation based on landmark recognition.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In a decentralized P2P lending system, using digital blockchain technology and the global reach of the Internet, lending can be done between any interested users without any financial institution involved, and provide better terms for borrowers and lenders. The use of Smart Contracts, unique self-executing archives of transactions, is supported by decentralized blockchain authentication, reducing overhead to operate a lending platform. One such platform, Lendoit, exemplifies this system. On its website, a borrower can enter their information, upload verifiable documents, and enter their requested loan amount. Lendoit uses multiple verification sources to assign a quality score, a form of credit rating, to that request. Lenders offer bids for interest and repayment, spreading the risk rather than concentrating it, and reducing the overall interest rate in a reverse auction. Once the requested amount is gathered and accepted, the Lendoit Smart Contract then issues payment notices, collects, updates itself, or if a payment is missed, can add penalties or report default for collection. P2P lending also allows cash-out and secondary market sales, creating other markets for profit-seeking. Growth in P2P lending has already been explosive, especially in the U.K. and China, but the industry is expected to grow even faster as more platforms and potential users take advantage of the decentralization that simplifies the entire process .","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Maximizing the population homogeneity in the microregions, maximizing the variety of medical procedures offered in the microregions, and minimizing the inter-microregion distances to be traveled by patients are considered as three objective functions of the problem. An integer-coded multi-objective genetic algorithm is adopted as the optimization tool, which yields a significant improvement to the existing healthcare system map of the Parana State. The results obtained may have a strong impact on the healthcare system management in Parana. The model proposed here could be a useful tool to aid the decision-making in health management, as well as for better organization of any healthcare system, including those of other Brazilian States.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The basic aims of this study are to present different views on international crises, to gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the literature on crisis definitions, and to develop an agenda for future research on international crisis management. This article also investigated the hypotheses that leadership qualities during crises are associated with the outcomes of the crises.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Two ports are considered: a purely private port and a landlord (partial public) port. These two ports are in Cournot or Bertrand competition or cooperation with differentiated service. Our model outcomes lead to the following conclusions. First, the optimal private level of port 2 under Cournot and Bertrand competitions varies between fully private and highly public concerned port, while government will prefer a highly public concerned or close to highly public concerned port in the cooperation scenario. Second, government will have to make more and stricter efforts to enhance environmental protection in the situation of port cooperation (monopoly) than in the case of inter-port competition, and all the optimal emission tax should be always lower than the marginal emission damage. Third, port privatization has a non-monotonous effect on ports’ environmental damage in the inter-port competition scenarios and a monotonous decreasing effect in the cooperation scenario. Fourth, the total emission tax revenue is always higher than the overall environmental damage in the cooperative scenario, and it may or may not be able to cover the whole environment damage in Cournot and Bertrand competitions. Finally, the government may face a trade-off among environmental protection, maximizing social welfare, satisfying individual motivation, when considering port cooperation (monopoly).","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This review provides a brief introduction to the development of brain science as it relates to pain processing and a snapshot of recent functional imaging results with somatic and visceral pain. Particular emphasis is placed on current hypotheses regarding dysfunction of the brain-gut axis in IBS patients. There are clear and interpretable differences in brain activation following somatic as compared with visceral noxious sensation. Noxious visceral distension, particularly of the lower gastrointestinal tract, activates regions associated with unpleasant affect and autonomic responses. Noxious somatic sensation, in contrast, activates regions associated with cognition and skeletomotor responses. Differences between IBS patients and control subjects, however, were far less clear and interpretable. While this is in part due to the newness of this field, it also reflects weaknesses inherent within the current understanding of IBS. Future use of functional imaging to examine IBS and other functional disorders will be more likely to succeed by describing clear theoretical and clinical endpoints.

McGahey and Jennifer S. Vey (Brookings Institution Press, 2008). I argue that the main rationale for adopting policies to revitalize older industrial cities is to improve the per capita earnings of urban residents. Therefore, urban economic development policy should be seen as urban labor market policy. Increasing city residents’ earnings requires progress on two fronts: increasing metropolitan labor demand; increasing the quantity and quality of the effective labor supply of city residents so that they can better access high-quality jobs. Effective policies to increase metropolitan labor demand include: reforms to business incentive policies to place more emphasis on providing corporations with in-kind incentives such as customized job training; helping small and medium-sized businesses by providing them with useful information to enhance business productivity. Effective policies to increase city residents’ labor supply include: high-quality preschool education; more time during the early elementary years on core learning tasks; reforming high school to develop stronger links with careers and employers; expanding community college efforts that provide useful career training for high-quality jobs.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It was found that the development of hypokinetic stress in rats induced by limitation of their mobility results in a considerable decrease of the coefficient of motor asymmetry (up to inversion of its sign); this can be related to a decrease in the resistivity to stressing and adaptability of the organism to the influence of external factors. The influence of EHF EMR on the animals under conditions of both normal and limited motor activity resulted in an increase in the index of motor lateralization in animals of all phenotypic groups under study; probably, this helped to increase the adaptive capabilities of the organism.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

One-session psychological debriefing has been routinely used as a primary preventive intervention for individuals exposed to trauma, but the appropriateness of this practice has been questioned. The authors describe an alternative, secondary prevention model of brief exposure-based treatment using three cases of military members seeking help at a forward-deployed medical clinic in Iraq for PTSD symptoms following combat-related traumas. Treatment involved repeated imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure conducted in four therapy sessions over a five-week period. Baseline measures on the PTSD Checklist were at a level that is considered to be in the range of PTSD. The results indicated that after four treatment sessions, PTSD symptoms were reduced by an average of 56%, and the final PTSD Checklist scores were within normal limits. The results suggest that prolonged exposure therapy may be a rapid individual treatment for the secondary prevention of combat-related PTSD.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The scheduling is based on an error-free credit-based fair queuing (CBFQ) algorithm which is developed for multi-rate error-prone wireless channels.

Here, we focus on the rat brain following stroke or seizures, and demonstrate how the two tasks can be approached simultaneously.ResultsWe applied SVD to time-series gene expression datasets from the rat experimental models of stroke and seizures. We demonstrate conservation of two eigensystems, reflecting inflammation and/or apoptosis (eigensystem 2) and neuronal synaptic activity (eigensystem 3), between the stroke and seizures. We analyzed cis-regulation of gene expression in the subspaces of the conserved eigensystems. Bayesian networks analysis was performed separately for either experimental model, with cross-system validation of the highest-ranking features. In this way, we correctly re-discovered the role of AP1 in the regulation of apoptosis, and the involvement of Creb and Egr in the regulation of synaptic activity-related genes.We identified a novel antagonistic effect of the motif recognized by the nuclear matrix attachment region-binding protein Satb1 on AP1-driven transcriptional activation, suggesting a link between chromatin loop structure and gene activation by AP1. The effects of motifs binding Satb1 and Creb on gene expression in brain conform to the assumption of the linear response model of gene regulation. Our data also suggest that numerous enhancers of neuronal-specific genes are important for their responsiveness to the synaptic activity.ConclusionEigensystems conserved between stroke and seizures separate effects of inflammation/apoptosis and neuronal synaptic activity, exerted by different transcription factors, on gene expression in rat brain.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Viewed in the context of the government’s contact with the foreign public, it seems promising for middle powers to invest in public diplomacy because wielding soft power is more relevant to public diplomacy than is sheer physical forces they are deficient. South Korea (Korea, hereafter) is no exception. Recently, the middle power concept has gained currency in the academia and policy circle. Although the concept is hardly new, scholars and practitioners have coined it as one of the most useful ways of defining the role of Korea which is playing, or should reasonably aspire, in a changing world (Kim Sangbae 2011; Kim Woosang 2012; Choi Young-chong 2012). This is an important claim because middle power approach requires reevaluation of, and departure from, Korea’s traditional foreign policy that has heavily relied on its alliance with the United States and almost exclusively engaged with the peninsula question.","[{""country"":[""Korea, Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Empirical findings show that both the direct and indirect effects of eco-innovations help reduce environmental stress and that the strength of these impacts varies across the value chain depending on the technology adopted and the type of pollutant under scrutiny. The main implications we can deduce are that, first both corporate and policy governance strategies should specifically address the goal of maximizing environmental gains that can be achieved through the development and adoption of clean technologies along the supply chain, and second both strategies should be coordinated in order to minimize the costs for reducing environmental pressures.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The two systems act in an opposite manner. This review focuses on the interplay between WNT/β-catenin signaling and PPAR-γ and their metabolic implications as potential therapeutic target in gliomas. Activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway stimulates the transcription of genes involved in proliferation, invasion, nucleotide synthesis, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. Activation of PPAR-γ agonists inhibits various signaling pathways such as the JAK/STAT, WNT/β-catenin, and PI3K/Akt pathways, which reduces tumor growth, cell proliferation, cell invasiveness, and angiogenesis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, curcumin, antipsychotic drugs, adiponectin, and sulforaphane downregulate the WNT/β-catenin pathway through the upregulation of PPAR-γ and thus appear to provide an interesting therapeutic approach for gliomas. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an antiangiogenic agent. The downstream action of this opposite interplay may explain the TMZ-resistance often reported in gliomas.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Yet, each of these advances were the result of decades of meticulous model building and validation, which are impossible to replicate in most complex biological, social or technological systems that lack accurate microscopic models. Here we develop a method to infer the microscopic dynamics of a complex system from observations of its response to external perturbations, allowing us to construct the most general class of nonlinear pairwise dynamics that are guaranteed to recover the observed behaviour. The result, which we test against both numerical and empirical data, is an effective dynamic model that can predict the system's behaviour and provide crucial insights into its inner workings.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

At the same time, however, they are often comprised of parties that are defined predominantly by their leaders’ personalities and exhibit little differentiation in terms of their policy orientation. Based on a dataset spanning all opposition coalitions since 2000 in Africa’s electoral democracies, this paper demonstrates not only that coalitions rarely defeat incumbents but also that they are only competitive when major opposition parties are involved. More significantly, the paper highlights that in many countries, a sizeable share of total electoral volatility is due to fluctuations in voting for opposition parties that have belonged to coalitions. The paper argues that such volatility reflects the inability of coalition members to build loyal constituency bases over time, which is critical for party development and broader consolidation.","[{""country"":[""Africa""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In order for METC-derived superoxide to participate in any of the above processes, its exit from mitochondria would be a critical step. Detection of intracellular superoxide showed that mitochondrial respiration is the major source of cellular superoxide in unstimulated or resting monocytes/macrophages. However, direct evidence for the exit of superoxide from mitochondria is presently lacking. Here we show that METC-derived superoxide does exit from mitochondria in unstimulated monocytes/macrophages. Release of superoxide was first found to occur with substrate-supported mitochondria isolated from these cells. We also observed the presence of extracellular superoxide with the intact unstimulated/resting cells. Extracellular superoxide was markedly diminished (>90%) by the mitochondrial inhibitor, rotenone, or the uncoupler, carbonylcyanide p -(trifluromethy) phenylhydrazone. Furthermore, cells with a deficient METC exhibited significant reduction (>90%) in extracellular superoxide, demonstrating that with intact cells METC-derived superoxide not only exits from mitochondria, but can be released extracellularly. Superoxide anion radical released from mitochondria could react with exogenous nitric oxide, forming peroxynitrite. Mitochondria-derived extracellular superoxide could also oxidize low-density lipoprotein (LDL). These results thus resolve any uncertainty on the ability of superoxide to exit from mitochondria. This study for the first time also identifies mitochondria as the major source of extracellular superoxide in unstimulated resting monocytes/macrophages, which has implications for the involvement of these mononuclear cells in various pathophysiological situations.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We assessed in vitro performance using eight genitourinary cancer cell lines and serial dilutions in three AR-V7-positive prostate cancer cell lines, as well as in 32 blood samples from patients with CRPC. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Both assays performed identically in the cell lines and serial dilutions showed identical diagnostic thresholds. Performance comparison in 32 clinical patient samples showed perfect concordance between the assays. In particular, both assays determined AR-V7 mRNA-positive CTCs in three patients with unexpected responses to next-generation anti-androgen therapy. Thus, technical differences between the assays can be excluded as the underlying reason for the unexpected responses to next-generation anti-androgen therapy in a subset of AR-V7 patients. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Irrespective of the method used, patients with AR-V7 mRNA-positive CRPC should not be systematically precluded from an otherwise safe treatment option.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

These innovations targeted the following workforce challenges which agencies besides those dedicated to transportation service provision at national, regional, and local levels of government are currently confronting: recruitment; retention; staff development; organizational change; and succession planning. These case studies provide specific examples of how these operational innovations came about. This is particularly important considering the obstacles, controversies, and liabilities associated with innovation identified in the public sector innovation literature. For example, the controversy over the relationship between slack resources and innovation is more than an academic debate given the fiscal shortfalls in gasoline and automobile tax revenues which are causing slack resources to dry up in transportation agencies across the U.S. The review concludes that while obstacles to innovation continue to exist, the case studies highlight many encouraging examples of workforce management innovations that are successful and being adopted by other state-level service agencies outside of transportation. This is particularly encouraging for agencies providing transportation services that are facing stiffer competition for the highly-qualified workers that they will need to replace those who are transitioning out of their workforces.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In the debate, Italy’s participation in international missions is often presented by emphasizing the humanitarian tasks over the combat ones. Military expenditures are debated mainly in light of budgetary considerations, because of the austerity measures, rather than in relation with defence policy goals. Many actors participate in different ways to the debate, including but not limited to institutional and political ones.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Both AC adsorption and US cavitation were investigated individually, in series and operating them in a combined way. The efficiency of above processes has been evaluated in terms of removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS). For the individual operation, the optimisation studies were carried out by using the following conditions: AC dosage (50–200 g/L); contact time (2, 4, 6 h); US power amplitude (50% and 80%) and US cavitation time (30–180 min). The optimisation studies utilising US power amplitude (50%) and cavitation time (15 min) followed by AC adsorption using minimum AC dosage (50 g/L) and contact time (30 min) resulted in ∼100% COD and 83.33% TSS removals which meets the discharge limits set by the Department of Environment (DoE), Malaysia. The hybrid operation was also studied by simultaneously employing AC adsorption and US cavitation and it was observed that an adsorption dosage of 50 g/L resulted into achieving 73.08% COD and 98.33% TSS removals within 15 min of US irradiation. With the possibility of continuous and feasible sonochemical reactors, this hybrid approach of US cavitation followed by AC adsorption could be an alternative processing technique for POME polishing.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Such a strategic choice is important in that an alliance teams up multiple firms that are divergent, to some extent, in upstream resource endowment and/or downstream market coverage. To bridge inter-partner differences and facilitate cooperation, it becomes necessary to select an appropriate governance structure to organize the collaborative activities. Indeed, studies based on transaction cost economics have provided a guideline that an equity alliance should be formed if the partnership is exposed to greater risks of opportunism and contractual hazards, which are primarily shaped by the degree of asset specificity, observability, and appropriability. Despite adherence to such a tenet, prior studies have seemed to prescribe conflicting cooperative strategies in governing the inter-organizational differences. As previous research noted that alliance scope also plays a crucial role in influencing the probability of partners? opportunism, it is essential to take into account the contingency of alliance scope in the quandary of the partner discrepancy-governance choice relationship. In determining a pertinent collaborative form, this study seeks to remedy prior oversight by considering concurrently ?how disparate partnering firms are from each other? and ?how vast the domain of collective activities is performed?.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Our purpose was to review the CT and MRI findings in PCNSL in our patients with AIDS and compare them with those reported in the literature. CT and MRI of 28 patients with AIDS and pathologically confirmed PCNSL were analysed retrospectively for the number of lesions, their site, size, density, signal intensity, contrast enhancement, oedema and mass effect. We found 82 lesions. On CT 45 lesions were found in 22 patients, whereas MRI revealed 66 in 20 patients. The lymphoma was solitary in 20 patients (29 %) and multiple in 20 (71 %). Spontaneous haemorrhage was seen in 7 patients. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed no enhancement in 27.3 % (18/66) of the lesions. In one patient diffuse signal abnormalities in the white matter were seen on T2-weighted images. Our findings suggest that the previously described spectrum imaging characteristics of PCNSL has widened. Neuroradiologists should be aware of the variable appearance in patients with AIDS. Spontaneous haemorrhage, a nonenhancing lesion, or diffuse white matter changes do not exclude lymphoma in an immunocompromised patient.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

How can and should it be evaluated? Over the past 5 years, there has been solid progress in developing social impact metrics at the industry-wide, firm and investment levels and the industry is becoming increasingly data-rich. Nevertheless, evaluation practices still tend to focus on counting inputs and outputs, and telling stories. Moreover, an important element is too often underdeveloped, invisible, not explicit or missing altogether. That element is theory of change, an approach and tool drawn from the field of program evaluation. This article reviews cases where theory of change has, in fact, been used to good effect at various levels of the impact investing industry. It also discusses a range of qualitative and quantitative methods which could be usefully blended with the theory of change approach, and affirms the equally important imperatives of accountability and learning across all combinations of methods. The article concludes that a more comprehensive application of theory of change to all levels of the field is required - and especially to the micro-level of individuals, households and communities, where the results of impact investments matter most. Such an approach can help build an impact investing industry that is adaptive, transparent and self-sustaining. To this end, creating an ongoing dialogue between the development evaluation field and the impact investing industry, and designing and launching new education and training initiatives, are key tasks in the years ahead.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For the first time in the history of the Ethiopian empire-state or, more precisely, since the forced incorporation of the Somali inhabited Ogaden into Ethiopia at the end of the 19th century, the Somalis are officially recognized as one of the country’s “nations, nationalities and peoples.” Since the accession to power of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in May 1991, attempts to forge a distinct “Ethiopian-Somali” or “Somali-Ethiopian” identity have superseded the former regimes’ patronizing attitudes toward the country’s “subject nationalities.”3 Throughout history Abyssinia and Somalia were perceived as two diametrically opposed collectives, identities, and principles.4 In stereotypical yet politically instrumental terms, Ethiopians and Somalis identified themselves as opposites in linguistic (Semitic vs. Cushitic), religious (Christian vs. Muslim), economic (settled cultivators vs. transhumant pastoralists), and political (hierarchical feudalism vs. egalitarian segmentary kinship) respects.

The paper draws on evidence gathered from a detailed documentary analysis and a series of in‐depth interviews undertaken with senior individuals working in the Irish NGDO sector. The analysis indicates variations in practice with regard to the substantive implementation of key downward accountability mechanisms. The accountability‐in‐practice revealed suggests that challenges to substantive implementation have arisen due to: insufficient Irish NGDO attention to oversight of downward accountability within locally based partner NGDOs; a reluctance and/or inability to transfer influence to locally based partner NGDOs by allowing them some influence on Irish NGDO governance and strategy; the perceived control of locally based partner NGDOs by local elites who may be distant from, and unrepresentative of, local communities; and a perception that locally based partner NGDOs may not require downward accountability. Drawing on these findings, the paper makes some suggestions aimed at helping to transform the rhetorical NGDO commitment to downward accountability into real practices that can contribute substantively to the realisation of the key elements of the rights‐based approach to development.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The present study used the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST: Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993), a task known to elevate cortisol secretion (Kudielka, Schommer, Hellhammer, & Kirschbaum, 2004), in order to examine the moderating physiological and subjective effects of chewing gum on social stress. Forty participants completed the TSST either with or without chewing gum. As expected, completion of the TSST elevated both cortisol and subjective stress levels, whilst impairing mood. Although gum moderated the perception of stress, cortisol concentrations were higher following the chewing of gum. The findings are consistent with Smith (2010) who argued that elevations in cortisol following the chewing of gum reflect heightened arousal. The findings suggest that chewing gum only benefits subjective measures of stress. The mechanism remains unclear; however, this may reflect increased cerebral blood flow, cognitive distraction, and/or effects secondary to task facilitation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For this purpose, we propose a three stage empirical strategy to analyse the differential individual effects of several factors on the decisions taken by the public agency. This analysis is based on project level data from cooperative R&D project calls under the Spanish PROFIT initiative, for the period 2000-2003. The main results show that the public agency uses the two financial instruments to address different objectives. First, some projects close to the market are well supported through credits, while basic research projects receive only selective support in the form of subsidies. Second, there is significant diversity in the selection and funding of technological areas. Third, regarding the explicit goal of fostering cooperation, the public agency selectively favours partnerships with universities and technology institutes through the award of subsidies. However, there seems to be less incentive for large consortia. Fourth, there are significant regional differences among financed projects and, also, our data show sharp yearly fluctuations.","[{""country"":[""Spain""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Here, electron cryomicroscopy together with computer-based docking of crystal structures into three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions provide the atomic models of myosin V in both weak and strong actin bound states. One structure shows that ATP binding opens the long cleft dividing the actin binding region of the motor domain, thus destroying the strong binding actomyosin interface while rearranging loop 2 as a tether. Nucleotide analogs showed a second new state in which the lever arm points upward, in a prepower-stroke configuration (lever arm up) bound to actin before phosphate release.

For the human being is a being of value. This study deals with the Religious Rites in Kirkpinar Wresting Tournaments and the Religious Beliefs of the Wrestlers. Within the frame of historical and cultural background of Kirkpinar oil wrestling tournaments, the aim is to determine peshrev / ritualistic behavior of the wrestlers in these tournaments and implicit religious-historical sense of the world of wrestling competitions as well as the religious belief levels of the wrestlers that participate in the oil wrestling tournaments. In this regard, the Religious Worldview Scale was used on the samples selected among the wrestlers that participate in Kirkpinar Oil Wrestling Tournament. Certain results were reached through the use of data acquired from this scale. Appropriate statistical tests were applied for the analysis and assessment of the acquired data. In addition to the religious-historical background of the wrestling tournaments, the religious beliefs of the wrestlers were determined as well. As a result of this finding, significant differences were found between the demographic variables and religious worldview.

Building upon theories from marketing and sociology, we propose that these contributions arise from team members' positions, or embeddedness, in a social network weaved through past film collaborations. These collaborations provide team members with opportunities to draw knowledge and skills from the network for new film projects. Our conceptual framework accentuates two aspects of network embeddedness: positional embeddedness (PE)—how well a person is tied to well-connected others, and junctional embeddedness (JE)—the extent to which a person bridges sub-communities in the industry. We examine how the importance of PE and JE varies by functional role (cast versus crew), and is moderated by the film's studio affiliation. Analyzing more than 15,000 industry professionals over nearly two decades of film collaborations, this research reveals crucial and divergent relationships: while high PE is more valuable for the cast, high JE is critical for the crew. This role distinction also depends on a film's studio affiliation. Managerially, these findings provide guidance to film executives and producers in revenue maximization through strategic team assembly, and to talents in career management.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As Dillard and Pfau (2002) noted in the first edition of The Persuasion Handbook, Aristotle “provided the first comprehensive theory of rhetorical discourse” (p. ix) in the fifth century BCE, and persuasion was central to that theory. Yet persuasion has not always been at the center of rhetorical theory. During the Enlightenment, the scope of rhetoric broadened to include aesthetic and psychological concerns, rendering persuasion secondary to considerations of “taste” and “sympathy.” More recently, narrative and dramatistic theories of rhetoric have emphasized identity or “identification” over persuasion, and some rhetorical scholars have even denounced persuasion as a mechanism of “control and domination” (Foss & Griffin, 1995, p. 2). Still, persuasion has remained a dominant theme in the rhetorical tradition, with two broad concerns distinguishing the rhetorical perspective from more scientific or empirical approaches to persuasion: a focus on the political or civic contexts of persuasion, and an overriding emphasis on ethical concerns. In this chapter, I survey the rhetorical tradition with a view toward illuminating some of the differing, even competing, perspectives on persuasion over the long history of rhetorical studies. In the process I highlight two cultural imperatives that help to account for the emphasis on politics and ethics in the Western rhetorical tradition: (1) the need to educate for citizenship, and (2) an ongoing debate over the rules or norms of democratic deliberation. In the rhetorical tradition, these two imperatives link the study of rhetoric to democratic theory, inspiring normative conceptions of persuasion that emphasize the responsibilities that go along with the right of free speech in a democracy. By surveying how rhetorical theorists historically have distinguished responsible or legitimate free speech from propaganda and demagoguery, I illuminate the intimate connections between rhetorical theories of persuasion and democracy itself. I begin by revisiting the classical/humanistic roots of the rhetorical tradition, from the sophists of ancient Greece to the Roman rhetoricians, Cicero and Quintilian. I then sketch the history of rhetorical theory through modern times, Persuasion in the Rhetorical Tradition","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Construction output is also found to increase significantly, especially in response to a bulk commodities shock, as a result of increased demand for resource related construction. Increased demand for construction has a positive spillover effect to parts of the manufacturing industry that supply the construction sector with intermediate inputs, such as the non-metallic mineral sub industry. In contrast, other manufacturing sub industries with only tenuous links to the resources sector such as textiles, clothing and other manufacturing, are relatively unresponsive to commodity price shocks.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this paper we highlight the role of organizational design and project structure and management on the development and experience of two “communities of practice” inside large bureaucratic organizations. Since we believe that organization and management structures shape organizational behavior (and not vice versa), and also that institutionalized occupational, organizational, and social processes serve as cognitive constraints and “mindsets” that guide participants in their work of knowledge creation and organizational problem-solving, we focus our attention on the manner in which structure and institutionalized organizational processes serve to facilitate or inhibit the processes of learning and knowledge creation in learning and problem-solving teams. As practitioners and as organizational scholars, our goal is to outline a set of actions that that grow from our narratives and analysis that will enable other practitioners and researchers to enhance organizational learning, to develop organizational capabilities, and to improve organizational performance in their own organizational communities of practice. Cross-functional teams are useful in developing innovative and optimal solutions to many types of business problems. In this paper, we are concerned with the particular challenges faced by cross-functional, multidisciplinary (and often cross-cultural) learning and problem-solving teams working inside deep organizational, occupational, and national cultures that are functionally, hierarchically, and geographically organized and structured. Collaboration is not a norm in these companies and cultures -the requisite work processes, organizational structures and reward systems, leadership models and practices, and interpersonal and team competencies for working in collaborative work systems are often absent, underdeveloped, or forbidden. Barriers are formidable, and a cross-functional, multidisciplinary team’s internal alignment often runs counter to that of the prevailing organizational structures, culture, and norms. After presenting a conceptual framework outlining the challenges facing multidisciplinary, global, cross-functional teams embedded in deeply functional organizations, we present two organizational stories of cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams working inside telecommunications operating companies. First, we chronicle a business process and system improvement team charged with designing and deploying a new system. The second team crossed international, occupational, and functional boundaries to develop a successful international marketing strategy. In the final section of the paper, we suggest some lessons that can be drawn from the teams’ experiences, and we relate the teams’ challenges, leadership, internal practices and processes, activities, and solutions to the challenges of knowledge creation, information transfer, organizational learning and collective problem-solving.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In a line of cases beginning in 1996, the Ohio Supreme Court broadly interpreted this statutory language to include situations where the intent to commit the underlying felony was formed subsequent to the death, as a complete afterthought. With these cases, the Ohio Supreme Court departed from the majority view that the intent to commit the underlying felony must precede or co-exist with the death. The author argues that this new statutory interpretation represents an unwarranted expansion of the felony-murder rule that disregards the statutory language, ignores the underlying purpose of the rule, and dispenses with traditional safeguards designed to ameliorate its harshness. The author further argues that applying this new statutory interpretation to the felony-murder death penalty specification potentially selects for death those who are not necessarily the most deserving of this ultimate punishment. The author suggests that the solution must be a legislative one.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For analyses of couple data neither the weights for females nor the weights for males are appropriate. We present formula for estimating the appropriate weights and apply these to an example data set of couples (The Dominican Republic DHS of 1996). To see how results vary when using male or female weights instead of couple weights, we analyze couple data from this DHS survey which has wide variability in response rates and sampling weight. Utilizing women’s weights, results for means and standard errors are within 2% of the values using couple weights in 23 of 28 comparisons, and 22 of 28 are within 2% using men’s weights.

However, the Court gave national courts very little guidance on what to consider when issuing a cross-border injunction. U.S. courts have encountered a similar form of an injunction used to consolidate multi-national litigation - the anti-suit injunction. In anti-suit injunction cases, United States courts developed a framework to equitably balance the policy concerns regarding multi-national sovereignty.

Generally, the panics followed periods of robust growth and occurred in the context of a recession, but not every recession featured a panic. Founding the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913 has ameliorated but has not prevented financial crises thereafter: The United States has witnessed three major episodes of financial crisis in the last century—1930–1934, the savings and loan (S&L) crisis3 of 1985–1989, and the current period, 2007–2009 (so far), which I refer to as the “subprime crisis”—and numerous smaller episodes, such as the near collapse of the commercial paper market in 1970, the seizure of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in 1984, the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, and Enron Corporation in 2001.

As a result, analyzing the ranges and tracts of human activities and gatherings based on bike share data is scientifically useful. This paper investigates the spatial and temporal travel characteristics of citizens based on real-time-extracted electric bikes (e-bikes) Global Positioning System (GPS) data from May to July in 2018 in the central area of Tengzhou City, Shandong Province, China. The research is conducive for the exploration of citizens’ changes in mobility behaviors, for the analysis of relationships between mobility changes and environmental or other possible factors, and for advancing policy proposals. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. First, in general, citizens’ travelling is featured by rides that are less than 10 min, shorter than 5 km, and with a speed between 5 km/h and 20 km/h. Second, in terms of temporal characteristics, monthly e-bike usage and citizens’ mobility are positively correlated with temperature in May and negatively correlated with temperature in July; an overall negative correlation is also manifested between the e-bike usage (mobility) and air quality index; daily usage reaches a trough on Tuesday and a peak on Friday, indicating the extent of mobility on respective days; e-bike usage and human outdoor behaviors are significantly lowered in rainy weather than in sunny weather; hourly rides reach a peak at 18:00 (more human activities) and a trough at 2:00 (less activities), and average hourly riding speed maximizes at 5:00 and minimizes around 8:00 and 17:00. Third, for spatial characteristics, destinations (D points) during morning rush hour and regions where e-bikes are densely employed are concentrated mainly in mid-north and middle parts of the central area (major human gatherings), and the rides have a diffusing pattern; e-bike origin–destination (O–D) trajectories radiate mostly towards the mid-north and the east during evening rush hour. In addition, 9.4% of the total trips to work areas during morning rush hour represent spillover commuting, indicating that separations between jobs and residential are not severe in the central area of Tengzhou City and commuting is relatively convenient.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Other short-chain fatty acids, except for propionate, had a similar effect. We focused our further studies on acetate, and in order to find out the cause of its stimulatory effect we investigated whether acetate itself was transported. In the absence of any other transportable anions 25 mM acetate supported secretion at the same rate as 25 mM HCO3- or 25 mM Cl-, i.e. 20% of the control rate. In solutions containing acetate as the only major anion (146 mM), fluid secretion was maintained at about 50% of the control rate. Amiloride (1 mM) inhibited this secretion by about 90%. In glands perfused with acetate/Cl- solutions, when the stimulatory effect was normally observed, amiloride (1 mM) inhibited secretion by 50-60% and SITS (0.1 mM) had no effect. Probenecid reversibly inhibited 75% of secretion in these glands, but it also inhibited 92% of secretion in glands perfused without any acetate. Interestingly, the acetate effect was abolished in glands stimulated with a higher concentration of acetylcholine (80 microM). Results of this study suggest that acetate can be transported by salivary endpieces and that this transport involves an amiloride-sensitive Na+-H+ antiport. We postulate that acetate may in addition have some regulatory or modifier role in salivary secretion.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This type of measure can also assist external stakeholders, such as the hotel guests and regulatory entities, to gauge hotels’ environmental sustainability efforts. This report presents the results of an exploratory study that develops such a measure, using resource consumption records of 984 U.S. hotels over a period of eight years. The measure is based on an analysis of resource consumption–related expenses found in these hotels’ year-end operating statements, for electricity, water and sewer, maintenance other expenses, and laundry, linen, and supplies for both the rooms and for food and beverage services. Using a multivariate data analysis technique called exploratory factor analysis, the measure developed in the study consists of two parts: an operating factor that comprises large weights from electricity, water and sewer, and maintenance expenses, and a behavioral factor, which is largely driven by laundry, linen, and supplies for both rooms and F&B operations. In general, costs found in the operating factor are under management control, but the costs in the behavioral factor are subject to guests’ activities. By normalizing the average of each of these two factors at zero, hotels that score above zero on each factor are spending more than other hotels, and those with a score below zero are more efficient than others. These factors can be compared according to various hotel characteristics, such as chain segment, the involvement of a third-party professional management company in the operating structure, location (both in terms of the degree of urbanization and climate zone), and whether the hotel offers F&B service. For instance, the above-average costs of providing F&B are clearly depicted in these measurements (as compared with limited-service operations).","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the instructional practices which may be related to the effectiveness of a performance-based system (PBS) and their impact on student achievement, as part of a thematic set of dissertations that examined different aspects of a PBS system in three separate school systems in different areas of the continental US. This specific study examined the role of instructional strategies in implementing and sustaining a performance-based system in order to better understand how instructional strategies can improve the implementation of an innovative school reform as well as support a sustainable outcome that improves student academic achievement. In the study, a questionnaire was utilized to measure instructional strategy perceptions. Next, instructional strategy actions and perceptions were explored through face-to-face focus groups with participants. Finally, classroom observations were conducted to determine which components of instructional practices are commonly used in a PBS. The design for this mixed method study integrated both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results of the study indicated that there were some differences in the perceptions and usage of instructional practices across grade levels and districts. It was found the participants believed that the individualized nature of a PBS along with instilling student self-motivation is what promotes student achievement, not the use of specific instructional practices.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, little research has examined the differences between women who comply with requests for unwanted sexual activity and women who do not. This study utilized an attachment theory framework to investigate individual differences in women’s compliant sexual behavior. An ethnically diverse sample of 125 college women who had consented to unwanted sex with a current dating partner completed measures of their attachment style, commitment to their current relationship, perceptions of their partner’s commitment, and willingness to consent to unwanted sex in a hypothetical scenario. Results showed that attachment style and commitment perceptions were associated with women’s willingness to consent to unwanted sex with a dating partner in the hypothetical scenario and their reasons for this decision. As predicted, anxiously attached women were the most willing to consent to unwanted sex, and they often cited fears that their partner would lose interest in them as reasons for their compliance. Contrary to hypotheses, avoidantly attached women were not the least willing to consent to unwanted sex. They often reported passively complying with a partner’s sexual request in order to fulfill relationship obligations. The importance of sexuality to attachment formation in dating relationships and the potential consequences of consenting to unwanted sex are discussed.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It is timed to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Its broader purpose, however, is to discuss EFSA’s future role within the rapidly evolving EU food law regime while at the same identifying new trends. The Authority and the EU substantive food law regime are, and have always been since their very inception, intertwined to the point that they cannot be unambiguously separated. Hence the methodological choice made in this book to focus on EFSA in order to apprehend the broader, substantive normative framework of EU food law while at the same time discussing substantive EU food law with the aim to better grasp EFSA’s rationale and future trajectories. Each chapter discusses how EFSA's role has evolved (the diachronic view) and identifies what it should have done differently (the normative view) while presenting an overall assessment of how the agency has discharged its mandate.Our hope is to have succeeded in addressing some of the most frequent criticisms directed at EFSA and its underlying food regulatory regime. The challenge is to differentiate the criticisms based on ill-informed, factual errors and misrepresentation from those that are genuinely well founded and require creative regulatory action. In general, the wealth of perspectives gathered in this volume seems to demystify some of the common claims portraying the Authority as either ‘pro-industry’ (e.g. in its scientific assessment of GMOs) or ‘anti-industry’ (e.g. in its scientific assessment of health claims). Overall, the Authority emerges as belonging to a balanced, yet improvable, food legal system that deserves permanent scrutiny, guidance and judgment. That is the expectation of 500 million EU citizens, the daily clients of this very system. Although predominantly grounded in EU administrative law, this book represents one of the first contextual analyses of a EU agency. As such, it nurtures the ambition to inspire more creative research around the functioning of these archetypally European, yet atypical, creatures and could be applicable to the understanding of other sister agencies.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The aim of our work was to assess the value of the TPO assay for differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenias in a large cohort of patients classified according to the results of their platelet isotopic study. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We measured TPO (R&D Systems) in serum of 160 thrombocytopenic patients referred to our department for platelet life span isotopic studies. We classified patients as follows: (a) idiopathic or autoimmune thrombocytopenia group (ITP; patients with increased platelet destruction and shortened platelet life span; n = 67); (b) pure genetic thrombocytopenia group (patients with decreased platelet production, normal platelet life span, and without bone marrow aplasia; n = 55); (c) bone marrow aplasia group (BM; patients with decreased platelet production, normal platelet life span, and bone marrow aplasia; n = 13). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In patients with pure genetic thrombocytopenia, TPO (median, 55 ng/L) was not different from TPO in patients with ITP (median, 58 ng/L) or controls (n = 54; median, 51 ng/L). Only in patients with bone marrow aplasia was TPO significantly higher (median, 155 ng/L) and negatively correlated to the platelet count (r(2) = 0.5014). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Although the median serum TPO is increased in thrombocytopenia with decreased platelet production from bone marrow aplasia, it does not differentiate patients with pure genetic thrombocytopenia from those with ITP.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is also well know that, compared to younger adults, even older adults who have clinically normal hearing and memory abilities often find it to be more difficult to communicate, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is poor, and there are competing sounds or tasks that demand dividing attention. Furthermore, laboratory and epidemiological research suggest that there is a connection between hearing and memory declines in older adults, including those with no clinically significant problems, those with mild problems, and those with more significant clinical problems. On the one hand, challenging communication environments may accelerate social withdrawal and cognitive decline. On the other hand, good communication and social interaction may be an important part of promoting healthy and active aging. This paper will provide a brief review of research about the combined effects of auditory and cognitive aging on speech communication in everyday life. The presentation will emphasize the importance of these issues in designing accessible communication environments to promote and maintain active communication and social participation by older adults.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To achieve this goal 30 patients were randomly assigned to two groups: Group one: intervention group received acupuncture in three points (KI10), (BL40) and (SP6). Control group received Sham acupuncture in three points that doesn't belong to any meridian. Both groups received the acupuncture by leopard spot technique and the treatment was given 24h after lumbar surgery for LDD and LSS. The pain assessment was evaluated by subjective measurement (VAS)and objective by measuring the angle of the hip in (lasegue Test) before and after acupuncture. Our results showed a significant decrease in the pain on VAS and a significant increase in angle measurement between before and after the acupuncture in both groups and no difference between the two groups. Our results confirmed that acupuncture can be used as a post-operative pain analgesic; it also proved the efficiency of the points choice. However, the therapeutic effect found in the control group is not unusual and can be explained by several theories: a.leopard spot technique that has a systemic effect on the qi and xue of the body.b.Sham points had common dermatomes with true acupoints.

However, Brown, Lo & Lys (1999) analytically show that the scale effects that are present in levels regressions increase the R-square value and this causes it to be an unreliable measure of relevance. Accordingly, this study examines the value relevance of accounting using a different methodology that does not rely on R^2. Specifically, we measure value relevance using price deflated residuals derived from the estimation of the Ohlson (1995) valuation model. Empirical results based on this methodology clearly indicate the presence of a downward trend in the relevance of accounting during the past 51 years. Further, a comparison of High-Tech companies versus Low-Tech companies suggests accounting information to be less value relevant for companies belonging to high technology industries.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Adding hedge funds with a lockup period to the portfolio of stocks and bonds generates large, negative hedge demands for stocks. More importantly, an investor with a portfolio of stocks, bonds and hedge funds under both the unconditional strategy and conditional strategy is hurt by the presence of a hedge fund lockup period. In an unconditional setting, we find a Sharpe ratio of 1.11 for the portfolio of stocks, bonds and hedge funds adjusted for stale pricing, with a three-month lockup period for hedge funds and monthly rebalancing of stocks and bonds. For the same portfolio, but without a hedge fund lockup period, we find a significantly higher Sharpe ratio of 1.43.

This article reports a case study involving four college EFL students in China over a six-month period of self-regulated learning (SRL) in developing their listening in independent settings. The study examined how the achievement and metacognitive awareness of four high-achieving and low-achieving listeners may have been affected by strategies they used for self-regulating extensive listening activities. It also examined the learners’ engagement during four phases of self-regulated listening, namely, task definition, goal setting and planning, strategy enactment, and metacognitive adaptation. Findings revealed substantial differences in the two groups’ metacognitive engagement in three SRL phases. The article argues that the achievements of the respective learners in listening development were affected by these differences. Pedagogical implications of a self-regulated learning approach in extensive listening for L2 listening development are discussed.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We show that group purchasing also has other motivations. These motivations can explain a rather puzzling procurement practice where some large buyers subscribe to the GPO membership, only to later procure directly from the same vendor selling through the GPO. Interestingly, such GPO members often succeed in negotiating a price less than the GPO-negotiated price. The ""economies of scale"" reasoning suggests that an individual buyer would always be better off purchasing supplies as part of a group rather than on its own. However, we show that the above mentioned practice of renegotiation by large GPO members can be explained by price uncertainties prevailing in the market. We also explain the impact of such renegotiation on the total buyer surplus as well as the surplus of individual buyers of different sizes.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It has been suggested that the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) gene may influence peripheral E(2) levels, but the role of common sequence variations in the ESR1 gene is unclear. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In 631 postmenopausal women and 528 men from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based, prospective cohort study of individuals aged 55 years and over, ESR1 PvuII-XbaI haplotypes were determined and correlated with plasma E2 levels. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In women, haplotype 1 (T-A) was significantly associated with an allele-dose-dependent decrease in E(2). After adjusting for age, body mass index, years since menopause and testosterone levels, plasma E(2) levels decreased by 1.90 pmol/l per allele copy of this haplotype (P < 0.05). Extreme genotypes, representing 23 and 27% of the population, varied by 3.93 pmol/l. No association with plasma testosterone was observed. In a subset of 446 women, no association of genotype with plasma concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione or estrone was seen. In men, none of the sex hormone levels was associated with the ESR1 PvuII-XbaI haplotypes. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: We have demonstrated a role for genetic variations in the ESR1 gene in determining post-menopausal E(2) levels in women.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

For this purpose we used historical prices of securities traded in the spot market of Sao Paulo Stock Exchange in the years 2007 to 2011, from files available in its website. A sample of 10 companies was selected among the stocks with higher trading volume during this period to collect the documents presented for communication of relevant facts and clarifications in stock exchange’s site. Only communications presented on the period specified that provide clarification related to news and unverified information disclosed in the press were brought within the scope of data collection. Until now, only the company communications with the most actively traded stocks were collected, whose analysis allowed the categorization of information and creation of a diagram for representing information about the rumors treated on these documents. This diagram was applied to a database where the information collected was stored for later retrieval and analysis. From this information, asset prices were retrieved to analyze the influence of rumors reported by the press in the price fluctuation of the asset. The authors Kapferer, Muller and Martins form the theoretical framework. As a result, the research has identified some rumors that interfered in the stock prices, as well as classified the rumors about the issues they address. So, as many times the rumor rises from the void of knowledge and information asymmetry, it is noted that there is no perfect competition among financial agents.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Sixteen patients (eight with structurally normal hearts but due to have catheter radio-frequency ablation of atrial tachyarrhythmias and eight with atrial septal defects (ASD) due for trans-catheter closure) and two volunteers were imaged at 1T. For each patient, a series of ECG-triggered images (5 mm thick slices, 2-3 mm apart) were acquired during breath holding. Depending on image quality, T1- or T2-weighted spin-echo images or gradient-echo cine images were used. The 3D reconstruction was performed off-line: the blood pools within cardiac chambers and great vessels were semi-automatically segmented, their outer surface was extracted using a marching cube algorithm and rendered. Intra- and inter-observer variability, effect of breath-hold position and differences between pulse sequences were assessed by imaging a volunteer. The 3D reconstructions were assessed by three cardiologists and compared with the 2D MR images and with 2D and 3D trans-esophagal and intra-cardiac echocardiography obtained during interventions. In every case, an anatomically detailed 3D volume was obtained. In the two patients where a 3 mm interval between slices was used, the resolution was not as good but it was still possible to visualize all the major anatomical structures. Spin-echo images lead to reconstructions more detailed than those obtained from gradient-echo images. However, gradient-echo images are easier to segment due to their greater contrast. Furthermore, because images were acquired at least at ten points in the cardiac cycles for every slice it was possible to reconstruct a cine loop and, for example, to visualize the evolution of the size and margins of the ASD during the cardiac cycle. 3D reconstruction proved to be an effective way to assess the relationship between the different parts of the cardiac anatomy. The technique was useful in planning interventions in these patients.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The findings indicate that in the long run each dollar of German aid is associated with an average increase of US$ 0.83 of German exports of goods. The effect varies by sector and the sectors that gain the most are machinery, electrical equipment and transport equipment. By using German input-output tables and according to our estimates, the aid-induced gains in exports generate a total employment effect of about 164,000 jobs of which 66,000 jobs are created in machinery, 26,000 in transport equipment, 24,000 in electrical equipment, 23,500 in basic metals and 18,000 in food, beverages and tobacco. The paper distinguishes among recipient countries and finds that the return on aid measured by German exports is higher for aid to countries considered as partner countries by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ countries).","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We provide a comprehensive definition of complex systems educational research (Hilpert & Marchand, under review; Jacobson et al., 2016) and an overview of methods specific to the approach (Hollenstein, 2013; Koopsman & Stavalomsis, 2016; Strogatz, 1994). After this, we delineate a research-based framework that can be used to develop and conduct complex systems research and evaluation. We identify two areas within the field of engineering education where complex systems research can be useful: 1) educational research focused on student interaction and cognition and 2) assessment and evaluation of collaboratives such as grant funded projects and communication/ publication networks. We discuss existing literature in these spaces, and then outline the critical research needs for engineering education. We address each of these critical needs with an eye on theory as well as methodological and analytic techniques that can be used to design and conduct complex systems research and evaluation in engineering education settings and contexts. The result is a set of specific guidelines that researchers can use to move complex systems research forward in engineering education.

We build our model on the resource-based view and on transaction cost economics and make use of survey data of purchasers engaging in international sourcing activities. We find four important drivers of purchasing performance, namely specialization, configuration, standardization and centralization.

Duffy and Richard Hynes, Statutory Domain and the Commercial Law of Intellectual Property, 102 VA. L. REV. 1 (2016), argues that the patent exhaustion (first sale) doctrine developed as a creature of federalism, intended to divide the line between the law of patents, which by that time had become exclusively federal, and the law of patented things, which were governed by the states. Late nineteenth and early twentieth century courts were explicit on the point, in decisions stretching from the 1850s well into the twentieth century.By the second half of the nineteenth century it was clear that federal supremacy controlled patent law, including patent infringement suits. The problem with the post-sale licensing restrictions that the patent exhaustion doctrine precluded is that enforcement of such restrictions via patent infringement suits would have applied federal supremacy so as to protect a set of practices (resale price maintenance, tying, and exclusive dealing) that state antitrust laws were just beginning to engage and often condemn. For example, if a tying or RPM restriction could be enforced via a patent infringement suit, the result would have been to preempt inconsistent state law declaring such practices anticompetitive. That was precisely the outcome that the Supreme Court reached in its Henry v. A.B. Dick decision in 1912, and that provoked Congress’ almost immediate reaction in passage of the Clayton Act.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

But there is considerable ambiguity about ‘outcomes’, and the term is far too often used in far too simplistic a way. This paper draws on empirical research into the outcomes of care proceedings for a randomly selected sample of 616 children in England and Wales, about half starting proceedings in 2009-10, and the others in 2014-15. The paper considers the challenges of achieving and assessing ‘good outcomes’ for the children. Outcomes are complex and fluid for all children, whatever the court order. One has to assess the progress of the children in the light of their individual needs and in the context of ‘normal’ child development; and in terms of the legal provisions and policy expectations. A core paradox is that some of the most uncertain outcomes are for children who remain with or return to their parents; yet law and policy require that first consideration is given to this option. Greater transparency about the uncertainty of outcomes is a necessary step towards better understanding the risks and potential benefits of care proceedings.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We find the Portland market to be primarily production constrained rather than network constrained.

The likelihood of developing NHL with severe immunosuppression is approximately 1% annually, an increase of about 100-fold compared with the general population. Even with a stable, effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, PLWH have a roughly 10-fold higher NHL risk than the general population. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is now a leading cause of death for PLWH (1). Thus, identifying NHL-specific risk factors and interventions is a high priority for improving HIV/AIDS clinical care. A team of investigators from the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) analyzed data from more than 50000 European patients to examine whether NHL risk in PLWH is further increased by co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) (2). In their analysis, the hazard ratios for NHL were 0.67 (95% CI, 0.40 to 1.12) with HCV infection and 1.33 (CI, 0.69 to 2.56) with HBV infection before ART initiation versus 1.73 (CI, 1.21 to 2.46) and 1.74 (CI, 1.08 to 2.82), respectively, during ART. Thus, these viral infections seem to be unassociated with NHL risk in the absence of ART but associated with NHL risk similar in magnitude to the estimated risk in the general population during ART (3, 4). Although this study was large and carefully conducted, there are reasons for caution in its interpretation. First, control of HIV replication with ART apparently had minimal effect on NHL risk. Incidence of NHL in the absence of HCV or HBV infection was 186 cases per 100000 person-years in ART-naive patients versus 149 cases per 100000 person-years in ART-treated patients. Incidence was actually higher in ART-treated patients than ART-naive patients among those with HCV infection, HBV infection, or dual infection. This finding runs counter to a substantial body of literature showing that HIV treatment consistently decreases risk for NHL. In particular, a previous article from COHERE reported systemic NHL incidence of 463 cases per 100000 person-years in untreated patients versus 205 cases per 100000 person-years among those receiving combination ART (rate ratio, 0.44) and primary brain lymphoma incidence of 57 versus 24 cases per 100000 person-years, respectively (rate ratio, 0.43) (5). Speculation on the reasons for this inconsistency is possible, given that the treated and untreated cohorts in the current study largely comprise the same persons who were switched after initiation of ART. However, the expected association of ART with NHL is so large that, in its absence, a superimposed effect of HCV or HBV infection becomes suspect. A second concern is the extrapolation of NHL risk estimates up to 10 years based on data for median follow-up of 13 months for untreated patients and 50 months for treated patients, with many more NHL cases indicated in the spline-based parametric cumulative incidence curves compared with the numbers actually observed among HCV- or HBV-infected patients. Because the association of ART with NHL risk was null, this extrapolation to intervals with sparse information could be problematic. Third, several previous studies of AIDS-related NHL have failed to detect increased hazard ratios for hepatitis virus co-infection. As cited by the authors, HCV infection was associated with decreased NHL risk in the Aquitaine cohort after adjustment for treatment (6). Also, HCV or HBV co-infection did not increase NHL risk in the Swiss HIV Cohort, although treatment status was not reported (7). Moreover, there was no association between HCV infection and NHL in the Chelsea and Westminster HIV cohort during the ART era (8). Finally, co-infection with HCV and HBV was not associated with hematologic cancer in patients in the Montefiore HIV cohort, 55% of whom were receiving ART (9). Although these new findings are potentially more specific for ART-treated patients, additional research is needed for confirmation. If HCV and HBV infection are actually associated with increased risk, several mechanisms could be responsible. These infections or their antiviral treatment could be immune stimulators, which contribute directly to lymphomagenesis. In patients with a low CD4 cell count, NHL arising soon after ART initiation could represent unmasking in the phenomenon known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. On the other hand, chronic HCV or HBV infection could hamper immune recovery or attenuate ART effectiveness. Hypothetically, anti-HCV or anti-HBV therapies could themselves be lymphomagenic. However, none of these potential carcinogenic effects would be important if HCV and HBV infection could be prevented or effectively treated. In fact, the main reasons to prevent and treat HCV and HBV infection are to reduce hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, which are more common sequelae of these viral infections than NHL. The ART-treated patients without HCV and HBV infection had a median CD4 count of 0.256109 cells/L at NHL diagnosis, and the counts in co-infected patients were even lower, which speaks to the need for earlier initiation of ART. Given that NHL among PLWH too often presents at a late stage, we have recently suggested that simple screening methods (physical examination, chest radiography, and serum lactate dehydrogenase measurement) might afford earlier detection of and lower mortality from lymphoma (10). In research studies of ART-naive PLWH, circulating levels of chemokines, other cytokines, micro-RNAs, and markers of microbial translocation have been predictive of AIDS lymphoma, but these parameters have not been evaluated in patients receiving effective ART or with regard to their performance in the presence of HCV or chronic HBV co-infection. The finding that NHL risk during ART is elevated 1.7-fold with HCV or HBV co-infection may partially explain the persistent excess of NHL in patients with well-controlled HIV infection. More important, this study highlights the urgent need to prevent HCV and HBV infection in PLWH and to treat those who are co-infected.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In particular, Professor Redish discusses the “outer limits of congressional power” to restrict federal courts’ power to hear suits relating to the constitutionality of government prohibition or regulation of same-sex marriage. Professor Redish argues that there are constitutional limits on congressional power in three circumstances: (1) when Congress uses its power to attempt to resolve substantive constitutional questions; (2) when Congress targets its authority at minorities seeking access to the federal courts; and (3) when Congress attempts to remove particular constitutional questions from adjudication in both federal and state courts. Finally, he concludes that Congress may remove adjudication of an asserted constitutional right to same-sex marriage from the purview of the federal courts. However, he suggests that this result may have very mixed political consequences for those who support adoption of such restrictions.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Methods : fourteen healthy older adults (65-73 yrs)walked multiple times over a platform with embedded obstacles and were tripped while trunk accelerations were assessed. Supported bodyweight (BW) by a safety harness was used to classify severity of the tripping outcome into high (>50%BW) or low (<50%BW). Twelve parameters obtained from the acceleration signals and their derivatives (jerk) within the first second after tripping initiation and were divided into three levels of parameter values with equal amount of trials. These low, medium and high values were tested for their association with trip severity in a logistic regression analysis. Results: three acceleration parametersappeared to be significant predictors oftrip severity. High values of minimum anterior-posterior acceleration and minimum vertical jerk showed lower likelihood of resulting in a high severity trip than in the low values (33% and 32%, respectively). Medium values of the maximum anterior-posterior acceleration showed higher likelihood of resulting in a h igh severity trip than the low values (327%). Conclusion : high acceleration and jerk peaks detected within the first second after tripping predict a more severe outcome, indicating that trunk tri-axial accelerometryhas the potential to predict the severity oftripping outcome in healthy older adults.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In order to analyse the specific elements, factors are given that contribute to the specific creation of radical right populist ?demand?, ?supply? and ?mobilisation?. Moreover, the theory of social constructivism is analysed to see how it could contribute to the created model. ::: ::: To support and test the theory, the theoretical framework will be tested on the political situation regarding Radical Right Populist Parties during the last two decades in Denmark and the Netherlands. While Radical Right Populist Parties in the form of the Dansk Folkeparti and Fremskridtspartiet has been present in Denmark, radical right populism has only been successful for a short term in the Netherlands in 2002 with the Lijst Pim Fortuyn.

The vestibular cue to heading is the direction of inertial acceleration that accompanies transient linear movements. This cue is transduced by the otolith organs. The otoliths also respond to gravitational acceleration, so vestibular heading discrimination could depend on (1) the direction of movement in head coordinates (i.e., relative to the otoliths), (2) the direction of movement in world coordinates (i.e., relative to gravity), or (3) body orientation (i.e., the direction of gravity relative to the otoliths). To quantify these effects, we measured vestibular and visual discrimination of heading along azimuth and elevation dimensions with observers oriented both upright and side-down relative to gravity. We compared vestibular heading thresholds with corresponding measurements of sensitivity to linear motion along lateral and vertical axes of the head (coarse direction discrimination and amplitude discrimination). Neither heading nor coarse direction thresholds depended on movement direction in world coordinates, demonstrating that the nervous system compensates for gravity. Instead, they depended similarly on movement direction in head coordinates (better performance in the horizontal plane) and on body orientation (better performance in the upright orientation). Heading thresholds were correlated with, but significantly larger than, predictions based on sensitivity in the coarse discrimination task. Simulations of a neuron/anti-neuron pair with idealized cosine-tuning properties show that heading thresholds larger than those predicted from coarse direction discrimination could be accounted for by an amplitude-response nonlinearity in the neural representation of inertial motion.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The program clearly needed a culture, a sense of community, and pride. With ideas lifted from NCHC conference sessions, a number of initiatives were launched, including contracts with students, a revived honors club, student-sponsored social events, and active student participation in regional conferences. The most interesting and perhaps controversial method of achieving esprit was the development of intensive first-year courses, taught by the director, in which the entire cohort worked in groups with interns, upper-division honors students, who served as discussion leaders and mentors and graded papers and quizzes. This first-year program became very loosely analogous to basic training or boot camp in that it was an intense experience, eventually shared by everyone in the program. It fashioned a strong bond between all members of the freshman cohort and initiated them into the honors community. HONORS 200: A WRITING WORKSHOP AND SEMINAR The director had inherited Honors 200, a standard writing course for first-semester honors students. Taken in lieu of the required freshman comp course, Honors 200 socialized new students to some extent by placing them all in the same section. The new wrinkles added by the director were to make substantial use of interns, to establish small groups for student responses to papers, and to include variations of City as Text[C] in some writing assignments. The course, which met on Tuesdays and Thursdays, required students to read a chapter illustrating a rhetorical category (narration, description, process analysis, etc.) each week from a book of essays, review sections of a writing manual from time to time, and complete two writing assignments a week. The Thursday assignment, written in class, was a quick response to a question posed by the instructor about one of the assigned essays; it was graded by the instructor and returned the following Thursday. Students found writing an organized paragraph or two with specific details in ten or fifteen minutes the most stressful component of the course, but they learned how to write a ""topic sentence"" (or at least get their point somewhere up front), provide transitions, and include relevant details. As the semester progressed, the quick-response writing became noticeably more fluent, and responses became longer, more detailed, and to the point. This once-a-week exercise was meant, among other things, to prepare students to perform well on essay exams and to think quickly and respond coherently in meetings, seminars, and colloquia. During all class sessions students sat together with their interns in designated groups of four or five. Each Tuesday they came to class with papers that had been assigned by their interns the previous week to be completed out of class on a word processor. Class time was spent for the most part working with the hard copies of these papers. The interns, together with the instructor, usually devised a different strategy or approach each week to enliven discussion. One week students might begin by reading just their first sentences or paragraphs, the rest of the group indicating what such openings had led them to expect in the rest of the paper; another week students might be asked to jot down concrete nouns, specific adjectives, vivid verbs, or effective or awkward phrases while one of them read her paper; or the papers might be scrambled and randomly distributed and read to see if the group could identify the author by the style or point of view. The variations and added wrinkles, many of them suggested by the interns, turned out to be endless. There were only two rules: everyone in the group had to talk, and all reactions and comments had to be specific. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Using linear regression, the author identifies statistically significant aspects of governance and compares them with results of previous studies. The findings serve as a basis for a discussion regarding how to create appropriate conditions for universities in order to improve their prospects for international success in research.

There are many surgical methods for the treatment of femoral neck fracture. Percutaneous cannulated lag screw fixation for the treatment of femoral neck fractures is favored by orthopaedic doctors because of its characteristics of being minimally invasive, with less bleeding and firm fixation. However, traditional freehand screw placement is limited by many factors, and the screw malposition rate is very high, which directly leads to the reduction of its biomechanical stability, and even leads to the ischemic necrosis of the femoral head caused by damage to blood vessels. In addition, excessive attempts to drill holes can damage cancellous bone and affect the screw's holding force, which reduces the stability of internal fixation and increases the risk of failure. At the same time, too much radiation exposure to medical personnel and patients also causes great damage to the body. Robot‐assisted orthopaedic surgery combines the mechanical “eye” (an infrared ray tracking device) and the mechanical “hand” (six degrees of freedom mechanical arm), and through the process of preoperative planning, intraoperative assistance in screw placement, and postoperative confirmation, provides a more minimally invasive and precise treatment method for this kind of surgery, and significantly reduces radiation exposure.

These are the only occasions on which the Royal assent has been refused locally in Victoria, and one of the very few such incidents in Australian history. One of the Bills would have implied a statement that UK law of the day was incompatible with religious liberty, and thus raised sectarian and Imperial complications; the other was a constitutional amendment passed without following the prescribed procedure.

Constructs are hypothetical concepts and the existence of certain constructs is never absolutely confirmed. Therefore, observations of individual behavior mostly provide conclusions about psychological constructs. These psychological constructs such as intelligence, creativity, extrovertedness and introvertedness are not directly observable (Croker & Algina, 1986). Cronbach and Meehl (1955) define psychological construct as ""some postulated attribute of people"" (as cited in Baykul, 2000). All constructs have two main features: 1. Every construct is an abstract summary of natural order; 2. Constructs are associated with observable entities or phenomena (Murphy & Davidshofer, 2001).According to Lord and Novick (1968), constructs that are not directly observable can be defined in two different ways: operational definition, which is essential to measure those constructs; and the theoretical relationship between a given construct and others and the relationship between a given construct and criteria in the outer world in addition to the operational definitions (Crocker & Algina, 1986). Operational definitions of constructs could relate to construct validity studies that discuss the development of a suitable measuring instrument for a construct and to what extent the instrument measures the related construct.Construct validity is based on the analysis of the relationships between responses to test items. To some extent, the process of establishing construct validity for a given test is the development of a scientific theory (Tekin, 2000). Construct validity is associated with the validity of implications about non-observable variables through observable variables. Construct validity shows how accurately a measuring instrument measures abstract psychological characteristics. Measuring the related abstract construct is based on transformation of the construct into a tangible, observable entity through observable behaviors. The transformation process into an observable construct includes the following stages: determining behaviors related to the measured construct, revealing constructs that are relevant or irrelevant to the measured construct and showing behavioral patterns that express others related to the measured construct (Murphy & Davidshofer, 2001).Construct validity studies could be conducted with different methods according to the quality and the form of a given construct and those of the measuring instrument used to measure the related construct, whether there are theories and scientific research on the construct and some other features (Erkus, 2003). Factor analysis is the most widely used method among these. In the literature, there is scientific consensus on the fact that factor analysis is a common statistical method used to determine construct validity (Anastasi, 1986; Atilgan, Kan, & Dogan, 2006; Crocer & Algina, 1986; Cronbach, 1990; Dancey & Reidy, 2004; Erkus, 2003; Pedhazur & Pedhazur, Schmelkin, 1991; Urbina, 2004). Because of the advantage entailed by internal dependencies in constructs by nature, factor analysis reduces the complexity of data and thus provides nearly the same amount of information as extensive data obtained by a number of original observations, with only a few factors (Cokluk, Sekercioglu, & Buyukozturk, 2010).According to Floyd and Widaman (1995), factor analysis has two approaches in the evaluation of psychological constructs: exploration and variable reduction. The exploratory aim of factor analysis defines lower dimensions of measuring instruments that represent a given construct, on the basis of the theoretical structure from which the instruments have been developed. Accordingly, the analysis focuses on the exploration of latent variables that form the basis of a scale. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We examine the extent to which the changes that accompany economic growth will ""solve"" water and sanitation problems in SSA and, if so, how long it will take. Our simulations suggest that WASH-related mortality will continue to differ markedly across countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, expected economic growth alone will not be sufficient to eliminate WASH-related mortality or eliminate the economic losses associated with poor access to water and sanitation infrastructure by 2050. In other countries, WASH-related mortality will sharply decline, although the economic losses associated with the time spent collecting water are forecast to persist. Overall, our findings suggest that in a subset of countries in sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., Angola, Niger, Sierra Leone, Chad and several others), WASH-related investments will remain a priority for decades and require a long-term, sustained effort from both the international community and national governments.","[{""country"":[""Africa"",""Angola"",""Chad"",""Niger"",""Sierra Leone""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Based on the specific intervention and target population, a CHW’s role can be modified to include health education, public health initiatives, patient advocacy, and specific topic knowledge. A long-standing obstacle is the retention of CHWs and the efficacy of their work in the community. Purpose: The purpose of this review was to distinguish the most effective characteristics of CHWs. This framework will be used to improve and evaluate a current CHW program in rural Alabama that targets breast cancer awareness in African American women. Methods: Two major databases, PubMed and Google Scholar, were used to identify studies that met inclusion criteria from the years 2010 through 2017. From the search, 15 relevant articles were found that highlight the qualities of effective community health worker interventions. Results: There were five prominent themes which emerged from the literature. Traits that were seen as important for an effective CHW included having knowledge of the topic, being a member of the community, having social and cultural competency, taking a personalized approach with the participants, and the efficiency of incentive-based interventions. Implications for Women’s health: It is important to take into account the CHWs, stakeholders, and participants opinions on what makes the interventions most effective. CHWs are often the link between rural communities and healthcare access. The traits found in this review of literature can be implemented in choosing effective CHWs in future rural women’s health programs. Choosing culturally competent, knowledgeable women to bring breast cancer education to rural communities aids these women in improving their health, preventing future health problems, and providing them with knowledge for early detection of health issues.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This provides a significant contribution to the field of entrepreneurship since it has struggled to find a bona fide way to define and identify opportunity. Most research on entrepreneurial opportunity has focused on the characteristics of the product being developed, e.g., what are the customer needs, do buyer compatible assets exist, is the product easily replicable, etc..., or on the personality traits of successful entrepreneurs such as locus of control, introvert/extrovert, and others. Currently, there is no legitimate model to demonstrate when a market presents an opportunity for a new entrant and what this entrant must look like in order to be successful.

The present data focus on polymorphism of the protein aggregates obtained at the isoelectric point (IP) and by changing the environmental pH above and below the IP, the protein concentration and the base. The SEM images provide evidence for a large variety of structures, depending on the pH and on protein concentration: mature amyloid fibrils and overstructured platelets are distinguishable in the aggregates below IP, and relatively high cyt c concentration, whereas inhomogeneous amyloid formations are observed above it. At pH 10, i.e. close to IP, only characteristic protein particulates at the micrometric scale are observed. SEM and Fluorescence data have been acquired in dried drops of protein solution, prepared in different bases: TRIS-HCl, at the different pH values, or NaOH (pH 13). Along with this, at relatively low cyt c concentration compact layered structures are visible below the IP, though still made of a thin fibrils reticulate, whereas above the IP, also at low cyt c concentration, granulates structures are present, merging into compact layer, alongside with platelets and mature fibers. These areas are characterized by diffuse ThT-fluorescence and typical fibrils. The loss of the predominant alpha helix secondary structure was verified by CD spectra.

Knowledge of the magnitude of the excess demand in the economy is essential for conducting fiscal and monetary policy. In a period of contraction when monetary policy is designed to control inflation, the excess demand measure is vital in constructing the concept of structural public budget balance, since the usual empirical concepts of output gap are not sufficiently well designed to give an accurate view of the negative excess demand when there are output breaks in the economy. The information produced by different quasi-official output gaps is quite often misleading, contributing to a rise in the unemployment rate, in the face of which policy-makers usually say “everything is all right, there nothing to be done”. We propose a solution that might contribute to solve this problem that is clearly a crucial one in times of crisis.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Not only was it possible for the country, by means of incisive anti-cyclical initiatives, to diminish the severity of the crisis, but the government’s determination and the array of instruments available were also reinforced to prioritize the long-term nature and maintain the growth of investment ahead of GDP. In fact, the proportion of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in GDP rose from 17.4 percent in 2007 to 19.3 percent in 2011, despite the fall posted at the end of 2009. From the perspective of sustainable development, however, this level is clearly insufficient.

Southeast Asia is one of the regions that has been plagued by severe ethno-nationalist strives due to its high level of diversity and the impact of colonialism. Among several cases of ethno-nationalist struggles in this region, the separatist insurgency in Aceh, Indonesia has been regarded as the protracted conflict that has been successfully resolved and generated durable peace. The Helsinki Peace Agreement attempted to redress the economic grievances that were manifested in perceived inequality and the exploitation of Aceh’s natural resources through the arrangement of Special Autonomy Fund. This fund serves as a peace dividend that is expected to bring welfare and enhance economic development in Aceh. The author examines the role of Special Autonomy Fund in accelerating economic development in Aceh in the past ten years by utilizing the concept of the peace dividend and the model of fiscal-sharing. While this fund has been successfully increasing Aceh economic growth compared to the conflict era, it has not been optimally utilized to reduce poverty and inequality. Due to the nature of peace in Aceh as an elite-based peace, the peace dividend has contributed to the patronage politics particularly among the former combatants.","[{""country"":[""Indonesia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Intermediaries aggregate many short-run transactions between various consumers and a particular producer. As such, they might be able to learn a producers level of proficiency more rapidly than an individual consumer. However, the presence of a positive information externality means that too few consumers will seek a referral.

Today, a turn-of-the-century crop of constitutions grants higher courts greater powers; provides long lists of social, economic, and cultural rights; and assigns international treaties constitutional status ""or better"" within the hierarchy of laws. High courts, in turn, have begun to cast themselves as defenders of rights and to intervene in significant political controversies. And, correspondingly, political claims more often take legal forms. The growing importance of law, legal discourse and legal institutions in the political arena has led scholars to report that a ""judicialization of politics"" is underway in the region. Our volume explores this landscape of changing legal cultures. Starting with the assumption that formalism is no longer a useful concept for describing Latin American legal cultures ""and was in any case always an oversimplification"" we explore the repertoires of legal ideas and practices that accompany, cause, and are a consequence of the judicialization of politics.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The lack of certainty from climate models warrants an examination of trends in observational records. However, the temporal resolution of records may affect the success of trend detection. Daily observations are often used, but may be too coarse to detect changes. Sub-daily records may improve detection, but their value is not yet quantified. Using daily and hourly records from 24 rain gages in Portland, Oregon (OR), trends in precipitation intensity and volume are examined for the period of 1999–2015. Daily intensity is measured using the Simple Daily Intensity Index, and this method is adapted to measure hourly scale intensity. Kendall’s tau, a non-parametric correlation coefficient, is used for monotonic trend detection. Field significance and tests for spatial autocorrelation using Moran’s Index are used to determine the significance of group hypothesis tests. Results indicate that the hourly data is superior in trend detection when compared with daily data; more trends are detected with hourly scale data at both the 5% and 10% significance levels. Hourly records showed a significant increase in 6 of 12 months, while daily records showed a significant increase in 4 of 12 months at the 10% significance level. At both scales increasing trends were concentrated in spring and summer months, while no winter trends were detected. Volume was shown to be increasing in most months experiencing increased intensity, and is a probable driver of the intensity trends observed.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

No differences were seen between bilingual and monolingual samples on basic math or executive control tasks; however, a bilingual advantage was seen in performance on the Symbol Math task across two experiments. The results suggest that bilingualism may improve the ability to engage in more abstract or symbolic thought processes, which may have important implications for algebra learning.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Once the electric power is formed, it is further passed through the transmission lines having high voltage and large capacity to the regions in which the electricity will be consumed. Then it is converted to a voltage that is low and is passed to the users. The energy/electricity restructured process has been performed in different parts economically to generate units that are small along with the separation of the utilities thereby increasing the market structure. But a number of defining factors makes electricity a difficult task to be dealt causing unstable conditions thereby leading to raise the cost of the electricity. A shortfall or surplus of electricity means not only few of the end users are not able to have the deficit/excess power, rather it focuses on the fact which endangers the whole power grid thereby causing it to be on the verge of instability further leading to extinction in the market structure. The bulk power market structure, which includes the exchange between utilities, sales to large commercial and contract based sales to distributors and industrial customers, is now characterized by-Sharp Price Competition. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the scope of the generation to be distributed based on Competitive Wholesale Market and study the impact of it on the deregulated power market [1].","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As there may be very short notice periods in play in these cases, it is important that adjusters and other individuals who are involved in the early stages of these claims be alert to a bank's potential liability.In Canada, the liability of banks that act on forged checks is governed by a mix of the common law and the federal Bills of Exchange Act (the ""Act"").1 This article discusses the legal reasons for placing liability on banks in these cases, and considers some common defenses that the subrogation professional may encounter when pursuing this avenue of recovery.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It remains unknown whether this vaccine will prevent carriage or transmission, key aspects in long-term vaccine success and disease eradication. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: Using a ""humanized"" transgenic mouse model of nasal colonization, we took a systematic approach to estimate the potential for carriage prevention against antigenically diverse Neisseria meningitidis strains and to compare this protection to an invasive meningococcal disease challenge model. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: The 4CMenB vaccine prevented morbidity and mortality after lethal invasive doses of all meningococcal strains tested. Immunization effectively prevented carriage with only 1 of 4 single antigen-matched strains but reduced or prevented nasal colonization by all 4 isolates with multiple cross-reacting antigens. Each immunized mouse had substantial immunoglobulin G targeting the challenge strains, indicating that antibody correlates with protection against sepsis but not nasal carriage. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Immunization with the 4CMenB vaccine elicits a robust humoral response that correlates with protection against invasive challenge but not with prevention of asymptomatic colonization. This suggests that widespread use of this vaccine will reduce morbidity and mortality rates in immunized individuals, with the potential to contribute to herd protection against a subset of strains.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We have also mapped how the different types of enterprises can join the incubation process and highlighted that for-profit organisations can also play a significant role within financing solutions. We made an attempt to prove that â€“ under adequate conditions â€“ the cooperation of private capital and incubators is suitable for creating a bridge over the equity and knowledge gap, which means that such co-operations can also have significant economic development effects. Incubators operating on such bases can support small and medium-sized enterprises not only by offering financial and professional help. Experience has shown that the incubation process can be ""naturally accompaniedâ€ by the initiation of a networking process, the advantages of which can also be used by the companies participating in incubation. After examining the special features related to the operation of corporate incubators â€“which served to set the logical frames of the analysis â€“ we studied in detail what role the state can assume in such type of incubation. Following some theoretical considerations and an analysis of successful and failed practical examples we reached the conclusion that governmental interventions â€žcan have their placeâ€ in this process. Since there are various different ways for the development of incubators, the types of roles taken by the state can also differ. A model was developed in which we summarized potential governmental strategies, also discussing the possible effects on the players of the incubation industry. We are convinced that the analysis of this highly new and dynamically developing area may also lead to conclusions that can be applied in practice and the recognition of defined rules and laws may contribute to the improvement of the national practice.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Few studies have assessed its psychometric properties in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). We therefore aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the HAQ in patients with SpA in Singapore. ::: ::: ::: METHOD ::: Cross-sectional data from a registry of 196 patients with SpA recruited from a dedicated tertiary referral clinic in Singapore from 2011 to 2014 was used. Analyses were guided by the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) framework. Internal consistency reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Convergent construct validity was assessed by 30 a priori hypotheses through correlation of the summary score and the eight domain scores of the HAQ with other health outcome measures: Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Global Score (BASG), pain, Patient's Global Assessment (PGA) and Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Divergent construct validity was assessed by poor correlation of HAQ with SF-36 Mental component score (MCS). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Among 196 patients (155 males [79.1%] median [range] age: 36 [17-70]; 166 Chinese [84.7%]), the HAQ showed a high internal consistency of 0.78-0.84. Convergent validity was supported by achieving 26 out of the 30 a priori hypotheses. Divergent validity was also established- correlation of SF-36 MCS with seven domains and summary scores of the HAQ were not statistically significant. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: This study supports the HAQ as a valid and reliable measure of disability for use in patients with SpA.","[{""country"":[""Singapore""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study aimed to detect spatial cluster pattern and identify riskier road segments (RRSs) of TC constrained by network with a two-step integrated method, called NKDE-GLINCS combining density estimation and spatial autocorrelation. The first step is novel and involves in spreading TC count to a density surface using Network-constrained Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE). The second step is the process of calculating local indicators of spatial association (LISA) using Network-constrained Getis-Ord Gi* (GLINCS). GLINCS takes the smoothed TC density as input value to identify locations of road segments with high risk. This method was tested using the TC data in 2007 in Wuhan, China. The results demonstrated that the method was valid to delineate TC cluster and identify risk road segments. Besides, it was more effective compared with traditional GLINCS using TC counting as input. Moreover, the top 20 road segments with high-high TC density at the significance level of 0.1 were listed. These results can promote a better identification of RRS, which is valuable in the pursuit of improving transit safety and sustainability in urban road network. Further research should address spatial-temporal analysis and TC factors exploration.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A survey questionnaire, which consisted of two parts, was a research instrument. The first concerned general information on a farm and its owner, and the other consisted of eight questions on technical equipment used for breeding dairy cows. The research allowed to determine that farmers assessed the condition of their machinery park as average (50%) or good (40%). One out of ten farmers claimed that the used machinery park in a farm is in a bad condition. Majority of respondents have allotted from PLN 20 to 50 thousand for investments related to enhancement of a machinery park within the last 5 years. On the other hand, a considerable part of farms allotted up to PLN 20 thousand for development of a machinery park. The investigated group included also farms, which allotted more than PLN 500 thousand for development of a park.","[{""country"":[""Poland""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Such theoretical development has proven useful when extended beyond traditional applications to crime event data. This study continues to explore the wider utility of such criminological theories by examining the spatio-temporal patterns of vehicle fires through an opportunity lens. Specifically, we explore the patterns associated with different types of vehicle fires, and consider longitudinal socio-economic trends that may influence the perceived costs and benefits associated with crimes committed with the intention of escaping debt, such as vehicle arson. Data for this study were obtained from Surrey Fire Services (2000–2015) and contain information about all vehicle fires occurring in Surrey, British Columbia (BC), Canada. Post-fire incident reports were used to group the fire data into non-suspicious and suspicious categories. Both categories were analyzed for local and global spatial clustering, hourly, daily, and monthly temporal patterns, and changes over the study period. Findings indicate that suspicious vehicle fire events concentrate in both space and time, and these patterns are distinct from non-suspicious vehicle fires. Further, suspicious vehicle fires events are significantly related to unemployment and interest rates, whilst non-suspicious vehicle fires are not. These results demonstrate the relevance of opportunity theories of crime to understanding vehicle fire patterns. By extension, this provides an important opportunity to connect such patterns with targeted crime (and fire) prevention policy and practice.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We consider a two-product firm that invests in the optimal capacity of product-flexible and product-dedicated resources in the presence of demand uncertainty. Before investing in capacity, the firm issues the optimal amount of debt, trading off the tax benefit and lower transaction cost of debt financing against the cost of financial distress and the agency cost associated with leverage. We show that in the presence of debt, resource flexibility has benefits in addition to reducing the mismatch between supply and demand. Namely, resource flexibility mitigates the shareholder--debtholder agency conflict as well as the risk of costly default. Most interestingly, we show that resource flexibility mitigates the underinvestment problem because it reduces the probability that a firm will go bankrupt with some of its capacity being fully utilized. When lenders anticipate that a firm will choose a relatively flexible capacity mix, they should provide more favorable credit terms, to which the firm should respond by issuing more debt. The main empirical predictions are that resource flexibility is negatively related to the cost of borrowing and positively related to debt. ::: ::: This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Particular issues involve the level of protection to which the detainees are entitled under the Geneva Conventions of 1949, whether as prisoners of war or civilian ""protected persons,"" or under some other status. After photos of prisoner abuse became public, the Defense Department released a series of internal documents disclosing policy deliberations about the appropriate techniques for interrogating persons the Administration had deemed to be ""unlawful combatants"" and who resisted the standard methods of questioning detainees. Investigations related to the allegations at Abu Ghraib revealed that some of the techniques discussed for ""unlawful combatants"" had come into use in Iraq, although none of the prisoners there was deemed to be an ""unlawful combatant."" The first half of this report outlines the provisions of the Conventions as they apply to prisoners of war and to civilians, and the minimum level of protection offered by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Following that is an analysis of key terms that set the standards for the treatment of prisoners that are especially relevant to interrogation (i.e., torture; coercion; and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment), and references to some historical war crimes cases and cases involving the treatment of persons suspected of engaging in terrorism. The second half of the report discusses and analyzes various Department of Defense interrogation techniques that are approved for all detainees (e.g., direct, incentive-based, fear-based, repetition, file and dossier, rapid fire, silence), and techniques that require the Commanding General's approval (e.g., dietary manipulation, sleep adjustment, isolation, presence of dogs, sensory deprivation, stress positions, removal of clothing).","[{""country"":[""Iraq""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

A certain surplus distribution mechanism (reversionary bonus) is employed to credit interest at or above certain specified guaranteed rate periodically to the policy holders. Besides the reversionary bonus, terminal bonus is also paid to the policy holder if the terminal surplus is positive. However, the insurer may default at maturity and the policy holders can only receive the residual assets. By neglecting market frictions, mortality risk and surrender option, and under certain assumptions on the bonus distribution mechanism, we are able to find analytic approximation solution to the pricing model. We also develop effective finite difference algorithms for the numerical solution of the contingent claims models.

When the younger/older CA ratio is between 0.80 and 0.90, raw score differences approximate the B–W mental age (MA) ratio of same-age B and W children on IQ tests. The typical W–B IQ difference is 10–20 points. The imitation of actual same-age W–B mean differences by different age groups of W (or B) has been observed in a number of psychometric characteristics besides total raw scores. Does the same “imitation” phenomenon occur for Spearman's hypothesis? This hypothesis states that the standardized mean W–B differences on various tests are directly related to the magnitudes of the tests' g loadings? In a battery of 17 diverse tests, the actual W–B comparisons strongly bear out Spearman's hypothesis. The comparisons of different age groups (of the same race) resemble the Spearman effect, but also clearly differ, as the least g-loaded tests show larger age-group differences than the corresponding differences between the age-matched W and B groups. The findings support Spearman's hypothesis that the W–B difference in test performance is predominantly a g difference rather than a unitary developmental difference affecting all factors in test performance.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Fitting was performed according to two different procedures in a double-blind study design. We used a comparative procedure based on optimizing speech intelligibility scores and a strictly implemented fitting formula. Hearing disability and handicap were assessed with the hearing handicap and disability inventory and benefit of hearing aids with the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit. Effects on health-related quality of life and depression were assessed with the EuroQol-5D questionnaire and the geriatric depression scale. We found that hearing-aid fitting according to either procedure had a significantly positive effect on disability and handicap associated with hearing loss. This effect lasted for several months. Only the effect on disability persisted after 1-year of follow-up. Self-reported benefit from hearing aids was comparable for both fitting procedures. Unaided hearing disability was more pronounced in groups of participants with greater hearing loss, while the benefit of hearing aids was independent from the degree of hearing impairment. First-time hearing aid users reported greater benefit from their hearing aids. The added value from a bilateral hearing-aid fitting was not significant.

In the present qualitative study, we explored young athletes’ (aged 10–15 years) understanding of four basic psychological skills: goal setting, mental imagery, self-talk, and relaxation.

However, some critical questions have been overlooked: does the inclusion of website customization induce users' commitment to the website more than does its absence? Do certain types of website customization enhance relational bonds while others are detrimental? The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of types of customization on commitment toward the website. Building on the conceptual framework of levels of processing [Craik & Lockhart 1973], this paper identified three types of customization: remembering, comprehension and association. An experiment with pretest-post test control group (N = 100) was designed to assess the impact of these three types of customization on commitment to the website. The results indicated that comprehension- and association-type of customization significantly induce higher commitment to, and a higher tendency to stay with, the website than that without any customization. Remembering-type of customization was found insignificant on all dependent measures as compared with non-customization. Implications of the findings are discussed. Keywords: customization types, commitment, levels-of-processing 1. Introduction Website customizations have drawn considerable attention from the fields of business and web design. Business scholars and practitioners consider customization to be one of the essential determinants of a viable online business bringing customers a sense of the old village market, where a shopkeeper knows every patron, interacts with each of them differently, and adjusts his or her services to each patron's individual needs, allowing the patron to feel a close relational bond with the shopkeeper [Lounsbury 2000; Schoder & Madeja 2004]. The ultimate goal of customization is to induce a user's commitment to a relationship with the website [Tiwana 2001; Wells & Wolfers 2000]. Research shows that profits could be exponentially increased from every committed customer [Berger & Nasr 1998]. Because of the Internet's great potential and promise, e-commerce practitioners have plunged headlong into website customization. For example, websites now greet users by name when they revisit a website, make personal recommendations when a user is looking for a book, or send an e-mail to alert a user about the latest special offers based on completed online questionnaires. Enormous industry faith has been put in customization as a panacea, no matter what sorts of customization are offered, because the individual needs of each consumer can be satisfied [Fineberg 1999; Kalyanaraman & Sundar 2006]. However, some customization strategies make the use of the website more complicated, distracting users and, as a consequence, leading users away from the websites. The consequences of the relationships between these customized websites and customers are even worse than that of websites without any customizations because of those undesirable customization strategies [Fournier et al. 1998; PWC 2001]. E-business vendors merely rush to cash in on potential rewards and assume that customization is a desirable element regardless of the types of customization. This gives rise to some critical questions: Does website customization induce users' commitment to the website more than its absence? Do certain types of website customizations produce a beneficial effect in enhancing relational bonds with the users while others are detrimental? Communication scholars have made attempts to resolve these questions. Research on customization has branched into two main bodies of work, one focusing on the nature and dimensions of customization [Kalyanaraman & Sunder 2006], the other borrowing concepts from interpersonal interaction to study the influence of customization [Fogg et al 1997; Moon 2000; Moon & Nass 1996b; Reeves & Nass 1996;]. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Due to several socio-economic and political factors Veps have experienced a drastic change in their communicative practices and ways of speaking in the last century. Indeed, Vepsian heritage language is now classifi ed as severely endangered by UNESCO. Since perestroika a group of Vepsian activists working in Petrozavodsk (Republic of Karelia) has been promoting Vepsian language and culture. This paper aims to challenge an international rhetoric around language endangerment and language death through an analysis of Vepsian language ecology and revitalisation. Vepsian ontologies and communicative practices do not always match detached meta- phors of language, which view them as separate entities and often in competition with each other. The efforts to promote the language and how these are discussed among the policy-makers and Vepsian activists also do not concur with such a drastic terminology as death and endangerment. Therefore, this paper aims to bring to the surface local ontologies and worldviews in order to query the paradigms around language shift and language death that dominate worldwide academic and political discourse.","[{""country"":[""Finland""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The hydrological year begins in March with a maximum in June associated with rainfall and another relative maximum in October derived from snow-break. General features of the rainy season and the excess or deficits thereof are analyzed using standardized precipitation index (SPI) for a six-month period in the basin. The SPI has a significant cycle of 14.3 years; the most severe excess (SPI greater than 2) has a return period of 25 years, while the most severe droughts (SPI less than −2) have a return period of 10 years. The SPI corresponding to the rainy season (April–September) (SPI9) has no significant trend and is used to classify wet/dry years. In order to establish the previous circulation patterns associated with interannual SPI9 variability, the composite fields of wet and dry years are compared. There is a tendency for wet (dry) periods to take place during El Nino (La Nina) years, when there are positive anomalies of precipitable water over the basin, when the zonal flow over the Pacific Ocean is weakened (intensified) and/or when there are negative pressure anomalies in the southern part of the country and Antarctic sea. Some prediction schemes using multiple linear regressions were performed. One of the models derived using the forward stepwise method explained 42% of the SPI9 variance and retained two predictors related to circulation over the Pacific Ocean: one of them shows the relevance of the intensity of zonal flow in mid-latitudes, and the other is because of the influence of low pressure near the Neuquen River basin. The cross-validation used to prove model efficiency showed a correlation of 0.41 between observed and estimated SPI9; there was a probability of detection of wet (dry) years of 80% (65%) and a false alarm relation of 25% in both cases.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In order to do so, we collected think-aloud protocol and other measures from 91 beginning biology majors reading an 8-page passage from their own textbook which included seven complex diagrams. We coded the protocols for a wide range of cognitive activities, including strategy use, inference, background knowledge, vocabulary, and word reading. Comparisons of verbalizations while reading running text vs. reading diagrams showed that high-level cognitive activities—inferences and high-level strategy use—were used a higher proportion of the time when comprehending diagrams compared to when reading text. However, in running text vs. diagrams participants used a wider range of different individual cognitive activities (e.g., more different types of inferences). Our results suggest that instructors might consider teaching students how to draw inferences in both text and diagrams. They also show an interesting paradox that warrants further research—students often skipped over or superficially skimmed diagrams, but when they did read the diagrams they engaged in more high-level cognitive activity.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

PCR products were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed using HIV-1 subtype reference sequences. Six full-length subtype C viruses from Brazil previously described as 'pure' strains were included in the analysis. Sequences suggestive of recombination were analysed by boot scanning and phylogenetic analyses of separate fragments. The common ancestry of recombinant strains was evaluated by similarity plot and informative site analyses. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: : HIV-1 subtypes commonly found in Brazil (B, C and F1) were observed. Sixty-two viruses were initially assigned as subtype C, but 15 viruses clustered in a separate internal clade. Pol from two full-length genomes of subtype C viruses grouped together with those samples. Boot scanning analysis showed that all 17 viruses had the same recombinant structure, with a 240 base pair fragment of subtype B in the middle of the reverse transcriptase pol region. Subtype B assignment of this fragment was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using different methods of tree inference and cluster robustness tests. Mosaics were shown to have a common ancestry. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: As CRF_BC represents 11% of the HIV-1 viruses circulating in the southern region of the country, which borders several south American countries, the assessment of its spread is of pivotal importance to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil and Latin America.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To do this, we use survey questions reflecting workers’ risk aversion parameters, coupled with a series of measures of the riskiness of workers’ compensation packages including the proportion of pay comprised of various forms of shared capitalism such as profit and gain sharing, ownership of company stock, and bonus arrangements. The primary finding of our paper is that a match between the workers’ risk preferences and the extent of risk in their compensation increases workers’ motivation, job satisfaction, company attachment, and loyalty, but risk-averse workers are generally less responsive to a preference-compensation match than risk-loving workers.

We have reviewed malpractice claims involving fatal and nonfatal injuries following tonsillectomy with an emphasis on anesthesia- and opioid-related claims and their characteristics. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Tonsillectomy-related malpractice claims and jury verdict reports from the United States (US) between 1984 and 2012 found in the LexisNexis MEGA™ Jury Verdicts and Settlements database were reviewed by two independent reviewers. LexisNexis database collects nationwide surgical, anesthesia, and other malpractice claims. Data including years of case and verdicts, surgical, anesthetic and postoperative opioid-related complications, details of injury, death, cause of death, litigation result, and judgment awarded were analyzed. When there were discrepancies between the two independent reviewers, a third reviewer (SS) was involved for resolution. Inflation adjusted monetary awards were based on 2013 US dollars. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: There were 242 tonsillectomy-related claim reports of which 98 were fatal claims (40.5%) and 144 nonfatal injury claims (59.5%). Verdict/settlement information was available in 72% of cases (n = 175). The median age group of patients was 8.5 years (range 9 months to 60 years). Primary causes for fatal claims were related to surgical factors (n = 39/98, 39.8%) followed by anesthesia-related (n = 36/98, 36.7%) and opioid-related factors (n = 16/98, 16.3%). Nonfatal injury claims were related to surgical (101/144, 70.1%), anesthesia (32/144, 22.2%)- and opioid-related factors (6/144, 4.2%). Sleep apnea was recorded in 17 fatal (17.4%) and 15 nonfatal claims (10.4%). Opioid-related claims had the largest median monetary awards for both fatal ($1 625 892) and nonfatal injury ($3 484 278) claims. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Tonsillectomy carries a high risk from a medical malpractice standpoint for the anesthesiologists and otolaryngologists. Although surgery-related claims were more common, opioids- and anesthetic-related claims were associated with larger median monetary verdicts, especially those associated with anoxic, nonfatal injuries. Caution is necessary when opioids are prescribed post-tonsillectomy, especially in patients with sleep apnea.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The rapid development of technology is influencing their learning habits and behaviours, and consequently this generation has a unique way of thinking and learning. The purpose of this research is to analyse the behaviours and preferences of digital natives through understanding their preferences in the use of technology and their cultural values, as a basic strategy for selecting learning methods. This research uses a survey method to explore the use of technology and the cultural values of digital natives on accounting courses. The cultural values referred to in this paper are Hofstede's cultural dimensions, namely power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation. The research results reveal two main findings: 1) the level of use of technology for non-academic purposes tended to be high, and the preference of the students was to use smartphones rather than fixed PCs or laptops. This suggests that lecturers must actively use technology in the classroom, thus ensuring that pre-service accountancy teaching students are themselves ready to use technology in their teaching practice; 2) analysis results of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions indicate that the students prefer learning in technological environments, informal learning structures, unlimited space and time, that they expect quick feedback, prefer teamworking, and prefer active learning rather than reading and listening. These results can be used as the basis for designing quality learning methods.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The goal of our study was to compare the effects of melatonin and midazolam administered as premedication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ::: Methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 53 patients (ASA I, II) undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anaesthesia. The patients were divided into three groups : group 1 (n = 18) included patients receiving 3 mg melatonin the night before and as premedication; group 2 (n = 17) included the patients receiving 3,75 mg midazolam (1 / 2 of a 7,5 mg tablet) by the same protocol as for melatonin; and group 3 (n = 18) included patients receiving placebo tablets. Preoperatively, the anxiety and sedation scores, as well as the quality of preanaesthetic sleep, were evaluated. Postoperatively, the anxiety and sedation scores and the number of remembered pictures were evaluated at 15 and 60 minutes and 6, 12 and 24 hours respectively. The intra-anaesthetic opioid requirements were also evaluated. ::: Results Preoperatively the lowest anxiety score was registered in the midazolam group; also the difference between the melatonin and midazolam groups was not significant. In the placebo group the anxiety score was significantly higher as compared with melatonin or midazolam. Postoperatively anxiety scores were lowest in the melatonin group at every time interval. The scores for the remembered pictures were consistently better in the melatonin group. The sedation score was lower in the melatonin group as compared with midazolam, as were the intra-anaesthetic opioid requirements. ::: Conclusions Melatonin (3 mg) can be successfully used as premedication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, especially for day case surgery. Advantages over midazolam and placebo include better perioperative anxiolysis, and a better recovery profile as assessed by sedation and memory.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Milward’s work has been influential in the intergovernmentalist traditions of analysis of the EU. This paper is not meant in any direct sense as a contribution to the debates intergovernmentalists have had with others. The analogy with Milward is first and foremost about how governments at one level can (try to) instrumentalise the resources and opportunities available to governments at another. For Milward 'nation-state' (that is, member state2) central governments fostered and instrumentalised an emergent transnational structure of government to achieve their own interests. This paper argues that regional governments have increasingly sought to instrumentalise member state central governments as a means of achieving their interests, that is preserving the meaning of regional law-making powers. It commences with a discussion of the conditions which prompt regional 'mobilisation' (Hooghe 1995) in the EU before examining in turn the three distinct strategies through which legislative regions have sought to realise their aims in the EU.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Mesopotamia, China, Egypt and Rome are some examples. Fertile lands, transportation and water supply were main factors. During the industrial revolution, however, stormwater started to be considered as a great matter for urban life. Urban floods started to increase in magnitude and frequency. Street gutters were used to convey stormwater and wastewater as well. Diseases spread around the industrial city and waters had to be discharged as faster as possible. As a consequence, urban drainage started to play an important role in cities life. It is possible to say that urbanisation is an inexorable trend. The urban population has been increasing significantly in the last two centuries, since industrial revolution took place. The consequences of this process incurs in great changes of the natural environment. Urbanisation process tends to substitute natural vegetation for impervious surfaces, thus reducing infiltration. It also tends to eliminate natural detention ponds, to rectify river courses, among other actions, that greatly interfere with superficial flows. In general, floods in urban areas present greater runoff volumes and flow velocities, resulting in higher flow peaks and water stages. This way, urbanisation aggravates floods and, as it could be seen in cities development, it was not always possible to accomplish urban growing with the adequate infrastructure, especially in developing and poor countries. Even in wealthy countries, urban growth stresses the existing infrastructure. Urban floods disrupts social systems and cause significant economic losses. Among the impacts produced, there are health hazards and losses of human lives, flooding of housing, commercial and industrial properties, flooding of streets and intersections, causing traffic delays, disruption of services such as water supply, power supply and sewerage. Flood control is, thus, one of the major issues with which urban planners must deal nowadays, once floods play a dramatic role in the cities. Additionally, the lack of planning frequently worsens this situation. Many times, the absence of systemic design tools capable to represent the problem in an integrated approach leads to a decision process in which local solutions may be inadequate for the whole system needs. An important tool to be considered refers to the mathematical modelling of hydrologic and hydraulic processes. 10","[{""country"":[""China"",""Egypt, Arab Rep."",""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The Toll-like family of receptors (TLRs), among other pattern recognition receptors (PRR), performs this detection process in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. These type I transmembrane receptors identify microbial conserved structures or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Recognition of microbial components by TLRs initiates signaling transduction pathways that induce gene expression. These gene products regulate innate immune responses and further develop an antigen-specific acquired immunity. TLR signaling pathways are regulated by intracellular adaptor molecules, such as MyD88, TIRAP/Mal, between others that provide specificity of individual TLR- mediated signaling pathways. TLRmediated activation of innate immunity is involved not only in host defense against pathogens but also in immune disorders. The involvement of TLR-mediated pathways in auto-immune and inflammatory diseases is described in this review article.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we surveyed first year Dutch and Swedish medical students (N=1173, cohorts from 2006-2009) on their preferences for specialties, fulltime or part-time work, and agreement to eleven work-life issues. We tested differences by gender or culture using chi square and logistic regression. Results: Over 93% of all students responded (N=1095). Almost no male first year student preferred gynecology as a specialty. Dutch male students were more often interested in surgery, Dutch female students in paediatrics. In the Netherlands, male students in particular preferred full-time work. In Sweden gender did not influence working hour preferences. Women in both countries expected equality in career-opportunities and care-tasks more than men, and agreed more often that their career would influence their family life. Women with a preference for surgery most often emphasized equality in career opportunities and care tasks. In most preferred specialties female gender related to a lower degree to full-time work. A gender gap in preferred working hours was larger for Dutch students preferring surgery or paediatrics than for Swedish students.

Using the statistic information supplied by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the article analyzes the earnings evolution, explaining the reasons why earnings inequality has increased, and the relation of this increase with the household income distribution. The main conclusions are the following: (a) changes on labor productivity are not the main cause of the increase in earnings’ inequality, and (b) this earnings’ inequality is not the only reason for the increase of the households’ income inequality.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We need to invest in forms of government and decision-making which contain cumulative principles which will both generate a capacity to value long-term investment for the future of life and enable social change and cultural evolution to have a truly genetic character, as effective for long-term stability and survival as molecular genetics are. All people need to respect that fertility is a sacred process through which we all become conscious beings, that childbirth is an essential component of the passage of the generations. Central to this is protecting the rights of women to reproductive, social and educational choice and providing adequate social, financial and contractual employment provisions to enable women to have children without compromising their professional or entrepreneurial careers. This is the ultimate test and end point of the scientific revolution, and is the fulfillment of the sense of living purpose religious traditions try to lay exclusive claim to, in which an ethic of living diversity and its protection must needs emerge and assert a natural morality for justice to prevail. Science has provided us with the knowledge to understand, in confounding detail, overthrowing all our preconceived assumptions, how the natural processes in the universe actually work and come together to enable the continuity of life. It is now up to us to engender a moral and ethical movement that can function to cherish and replenish the Earth throughout our generations to come. Part I of this article includes: 1.

Little is known about how having two-or-more long-term conditions (multimorbidity) and socioeconomic status affect social care use, or how all these factors affect unscheduled health care use. ::: Objectives and ApproachThe project aims to describe the demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic differences in the receipt of social care for over 65s in Scotland and how multimorbidity status influences amounts of social care received. Additional analyses will consider the influence receipt of social care has on use of unscheduled health care services and mortality. ::: Social Care Survey (SCS) data collected by the Scottish Government is linked to administrative health and mortality records. Linkage includes; prescribing information service and USC data which records episodes of A & E attendance, emergency admission to hospital, GP out-of-hours attendance, Scottish Ambulance Service use, and NHS24 contact ::: ResultsThe cohort includes 1.1million individuals over the age of 65 (54.8% Female), of which 274,011 (24.2%) people died during the study period. ::: The linkage rate of the SCS to records with a CHI number in the National Records of Scotland population spine was 90.5%, with one local authority removed for very low linkage rates and the remaining 31 with rates between 76.7% and 97.9%. ::: As of February 2018, all requested data has been transferred to the National Safe Haven and data cleaning and analysis has begun. Significant results are expected to have been produced by August 2018. ::: Conclusion/ImplicationsThis research will help understand if receipt of social care is equitably distributed among the population of Scotland after allowing for multimorbidity and socioeconomic status. Understanding the influence health status has on social care receipt and the influence social care has on unscheduled healthcare use has important implications for policy development.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this work, the consequences of neglecting variance non-stationarity in economic time series, and the conceptual difference between variance non-stationarity and conditional variance are discussed. An ad hoc method for testing and correcting for variance non-stationarity is suggested. It is shown that the presence of variance non-stationarity leads to misspecified univariate ARIMA models and correcting for it, the number of model parameters is vastly reduced. The implications of the tests for the hypothesis of weak form market efficiency (WFME) are discussed. More specifically it is argued that the usual autocorrelation tests are inappropriate when based on the differences of asset prices. Finally, it is shown how the analysis of outliers is affected by the presence of variance non-stationarity.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Due to its physical and psychological benefits, sport is increasingly re-commended for haemophilic patients. Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of sports therapy is still lacking. ::: ::: ::: AIM ::: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a 6-month programmed sports therapy (PST). ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The cost-effectiveness of the 6-month PST was assessed from a societal perspective alongside a RCT using cost-utility analysis. The analysis included 50 PwH with moderate-to-severe haemophilia A and B and a training period over 6 months. The health-related quality of life was measured with the EuroQoL-domain questionnaire. Resource utilization was assessed by questionnaire before and after the intervention. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was constructed, and sensitivity analyses were performed. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: During the 6-month study period, mean adjusted total healthcare costs were lower (mean difference: -22 805 EUR; 95%-CI: -73 944-48 463; P = .59) and the number of QALYs was higher in the intervention group (mean difference: 0.3733; 95%-CI: 0.0014-0.0573; P = .04). The probability of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <50 000 EUR per QALY was 71%. The performed sensitivity analysis confirmed these results. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Results showed that the PST is effective in terms of a significant gain of QALYs. Furthermore, results weakly indicate the potential of the PST to reduce healthcare costs. Future studies should expand the observation period to have a closer look at the influence of PST on lifetime costs.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Within the last decade many studies have focused on the evolution of performance in many sports with ageing, as well as on the training modalities to reach such performance. On the contrary, there is a paucity of data on the nutritional habits of master athletes and the question of whether they need to adapt their nutrition to the ageing process remains unsolved. This is within this context of the optimisation of nutrition for master athletes that this review stands. The aim is to identify the potential nutritional challenges encountered by master athletes and how to handle them through adapted nutritional strategies. Given the lack of data specific to master athletes, studies including master athletes are considered as a priority, though we also make inferences based on nutrition for young adults and perturbations induced by ageing in non-athletic populations. The first part of this opinion paper tackles the first challenge faced by master athletes which is the gradual reduction in energy intake with ageing. The second challenge is the anabolic resistance and the need for increased protein intake. The third nutritional challenge we present is the episodes of metabolic crisis master athletes may face throughout life. Finally, we gather the main nutritional recommendations for master athletes and suggest the next stage of research.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The return yielded 1,135 and 736 usable questionnaires, respectively, from which the data were analysed using LISREL structural equation modelling software. In Study 2, an experiment was used to examine whether idol attractiveness is likely to positively moderate the relationship between vanity traits and attachment. Findings – The results suggest that achievement vanity, variety seeking and peer norms have a positive impact on the phenomenon of idol attachment, which in turn positively affects human brand loyalty. Contradicting previous studies, the physical appearance of vanity was not found to be associated with idol attachment....","[{""country"":[""Australia"",""Taiwan, China""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

When firms actively compete against each other in a market, several social benefits are generated. In general, competition tends to lower costs, reduces production inefficiency, and leads to a more efficient allocation of societal resources. In other words, resources flow to their most productive uses. Competition is a dynamic process in that it is inherently forward looking, leading to innovation and creativity amongst producers. These benefits ultimately flow through to consumers, who enjoy a more wide range of product choices, higher-quality products, and lower prices. In general, the lower the degree of competition in a given market, the less present are these array of benefits—all else equal, less competitive markets can result in greater production inefficiencies, reduced innovation, fewer product choices, and higher prices for consumers, with the latter directly resulting in higher profits for producers.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We differentiate firms involved in both trading activities - namely two-way traders - from firms that only export, and from those that only import. We show that two-way traders have a higher propensity to employ non-production workers, exhibit significant wage gaps, but also pay higher wages for both production and non production workers, relative to non internationalized firms and to firms which are involved only in either export or import. The paper also looks at how the wages and the skill structure of the trading firms change with the country of destination and origin and with the firms’ sectoral and geographical diversification.","[{""country"":[""Italy""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Matrix tablets have been prepared using phenobarbital as drug, magnesium stearate as a lubricant employing different amount of lactose and HPMC K4M as a filler and matrix forming material, respectively. Ethylcelullose (EC) as a polymeric excipient was also examined. Dissolution studies were carried out using the paddle method.In order to estimate the percolation threshold, the behaviour of the kinetic parameters with respect to thevolumetric fraction of HPMC at time zero, was studied. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In both HPMC/lactose and HPMC/EC/lactose matrices, from the point of view of the percolation theory, the optimum concentration for HPMC, to obtain a hydrophilic matrix system for the controlled release of phenobarbital is higher than 18.1% (v/v) HPMC. Above 18.1% (v/v) HPMC, an infinite cluster of HPMC would be formed maintaining integrity of the system and controlling the drug release from the matrices. According to results, EC had no significant influence on the HPMC percolation threshold. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: This may be related to broad functionality of the swelling hydrophilic matrices.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In the absence of such awareness and knowledge, it is possible that the public may misallocate their support. In other words, resources may be provided for species that do not need support urgently. We show how availability of balanced information about species helps the public to make rational decisions and to allocate support (e.g. monetary) to species that need it most.

However, methods of analyzing EP have been limited mostly to the conventional ensemble averaging of EP response trials to a repeated stimulus, and less so to single-trials analysis. Here we applied a new approach - functional data analysis (FDA) - to study auditory EP in the rat model of tinnitus, in which overdoses of salicylate (SS) are known to alter sound perception characteristically, as the same way as in humans. Single-trial auditory EPs were analyzed, after being collected on a daily basis from an awake rat, which had been surgically implanted with intracranial electrodes over its auditory cortex. Single-trial EP integrals were generated with sound stimuli (tones and clicks) presented systematically over an intensity range. The results were approximated using the cubic spline to give sets of smoothed response-level functions in dependence on the sound intensity. These functional data were analyzed using the methods of FDA. Comparisons between daily intensity series for each sound type were done using cross-distance measures based on the response-level functions in both the original form and the first-derivative form. From the results of FDA, the first-derivative form was found to provide a clearer separation when EP data from control groups were compared to the data from SS groups. This is also true when the daily data were compared within the more variable SS-group itself. In addition, at the high-intensity region where SS-action is presumably strong, we also observed characteristic changes in two statistical parameters, mean and skewness, of the cross-distance representations. Results suggested that FDA is a sensitive approach for EP studies, and it can become a powerful tool for the research in neural science, particularly neuropharmacology.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Furthermore, the study aimed at establishing the factors that influence succession planning in public sector banks. Lack of continuous succession planning by public sector banks in India has made it impossible for majority of the banks to name a suitable successor within a year.

This article uses a recent FTC action, in which the accused advertiser suffered no adverse equity impact, to explain that result. Many advertising messages challenged by the FTC are not material to consumers. If not - and especially when, as in the case discussed here, the advertiser had much earlier discontinued the advertising challenged - the advertiser predictably would not suffer.

However, the age-dependent and regional peculiarities of distribution of glutamine synthetase (GS), an enzyme responsible for generation of glutamine, and factors regulating its enzymatic activity in mammalian skin remain undisclosed. To explore this, GS localization was investigated using immunohistochemistry and double-labeling of young and adult human and rat skin sections as well as skin cells in culture. In human and rat skin GS was almost completely co-localized with astrocyte-specific proteins (e.g. GFAP). While GS staining was pronounced in all layers of the epidermis of young human skin, staining was reduced and more differentiated among different layers with age. In stratum basale and in stratum spinosum GS was co-localized with the adherens junction component beta-catenin. Inhibition of, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta in cultured keratinocytes and HaCaT cells, however, did not support a direct role of beta-catenin in regulation of GS. Enzymatic and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies revealed an unusual mode of regulation of this enzyme in keratinocytes, i.e., GS activity, but not expression, was enhanced about 8-10 fold when the cells were exposed to ammonium ions. Prominent posttranscriptional up-regulation of GS activity in keratinocytes by ammonium ions in conjunction with widespread distribution of GS immunoreactivity throughout the epidermis allows considering the skin as a large reservoir of latent GS. Such a depository of glutamine-generating enzyme seems essential for continuous renewal of epidermal permeability barrier and during pathological processes accompanied by hyperammonemia.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The third tier status and existence of local government was further recognized and guaranteed in both the 1979, 1989 and 1999 constitutions. As a distinct tier of government, local governments are envisaged to have political/administrative and financial autonomy to enable them operate effectively as would be manifested in the substantial performance of the developmental functions that necessitated their creation. As such, the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in section 7 and section 162 provided for the political/administrative and financial autonomy of the local government respectively. Unfortunately, there are prevailing observations, by researchers and practitioners alike, that the local government autonomy is being substantial interfered in by the state governments. It is in the circumstance of this that the study examined the letters and spirit of the relevant and specific aspects of the 1999 constitution that are supposed to guarantee the local government autonomy, discussed the various patterns of interference in the autonomy particularly by the state governments and ex-rayed the extents to which the interference militates against the service delivery capacities of the local governments and their ultimate role of contributing to national development. Further, the study made recommendations towards enhancing and guaranteeing the local government autonomy in other to reposition them for more effective performance of their developmental roles. The basic recommendations made bordered on constitutional reforms that would expunge the provision of the State Joint Local Government Account (SJLGA) from the constitution, provide for a specific tenure of the local government councils and outright prohibition of the adoption of the Care-taker Committee system or any other arrangement as an alternative framework to a democratically elected council for administering the local governments. In carrying out the study, data and information were collected mainly through secondary sources like government publications, journals and textbooks. Consequently content analysis technique was adopted in the analysis and conclusion.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For the Euro Area, results are in line with the data and with earlier models, while for the U.S., there are discrepancies, suggesting the model may be useful to explain the bubble in the U.S. stock market. In a next stage, aggregate demand and supply equations are estimated and the additional value of price dividend metrics is investigated using robust regression techniques. The evidence suggests that model metrics are useful signals of the output gap and inflation. Finally, for the U.S., the overvaluation of the price dividend ratio, derived from the proposed model, seems to have had an impact on the Fed(TM)s interest rate policy.","[{""country"":[""European Union"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Although most missions launched by the Union so far have been relatively modest in their size and objectives, even small-scale operations may give rise to a breach of international law or cause damage and injury to private parties. Yet holding EU missions accountable for their activities is hampered by a range of legal and practical difficulties. One particularly thorny issue concerns the attribution of the wrongful acts committed by EU military operations: since they are composed of personnel made available to the Union by its Member States and third States, it is not immediately obvious which party — the EU, the contributing States or both — should bear responsibility for their conduct. This question is of great practical significance, for accountability cannot be discharged effectively if it is unclear where responsibility lies. The purpose of this chapter is to revisit this issue and establish what rules govern the attribution of wrongful acts committed by EU military operations. We begin our analysis by noting that no special considerations justify the application of lex specialis rules of attribution to EU crisis management missions. While this means that such missions are subject to the general rules of attribution laid down in the International Law Comission's (ILC) Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (DARIO), we argue that the way in which the ILC purports to apply these rules to peacekeeping operations is too narrow. Contrary to the approach adopted by the ILC, any attempt to establish where responsibility lies for the wrongful conduct of EU missions must first of all clarify their position within the legal order of the EU. To this end, we assess the legal framework and practice of EU military operations in order to establish whether they constitute either de jure or de facto organs of the Union. Based on this analysis, we submit that to be able to contribute to the governance of global security the EU should accept that the wrongful conduct of its crisis management missions are, in principle, attributable to it and seize the opportunity to contribute to the development of the law of international responsibility in this area.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Collectively, the recent findings on conflicts have fundamentally changed the way we think about DNA replication in vivo. Furthermore, new insights on this topic have revealed that the conflicts between replication and transcription significantly influence many key parameters of cellular function, including genome organization, mutagenesis, and evolution of stress response and virulence genes. In this review, we discuss the consequences of replication-transcription conflicts on the life of bacteria and describe some key strategies cells use to resolve them. We put special emphasis on two critical aspects of these encounters: ( a) the consequences of conflicts on replisome stability and dynamics, and ( b) the resulting increase in spontaneous mutagenesis.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Studies divide economic determinants into two categories based on their influence on economic growth: endogenous and exogenous. The study aims to estimate economic growth against two types of determinants for Romania and Central and Eastern European countries using data for 1995-2017 in order to compare the two cases. For Romania, we used time series specific methods (e.g. stationarity checking using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, OLS model). In case of Central and Eastern European countries, we employed methods specific for panel data (e.g. estimation of the OLS general model, fixed effects model, random effects model, and feasible generalized least squares model). The results showed that in Romania, in the studied period, only the exogenous determinants (e.g. high technology exports) have a significant influence on economic growth, while Central and Eastern European countries were influenced by both types of determinants (e.g. life expectancy, foreign direct investments). In case of Romania, foreign direct investment did not represent a significant determinant for economic growth during 1995-2017 due to slower transition from communist regime to market economy.","[{""country"":[""European Union"",""Romania""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The empirical results revealed that the coefficients of the total import, industrial capacity utilization rate, lending rate of commercial Banks, foreign private investment and liberalization policy period are significant in the long run. Whereas the coefficients of external reserves, inflation rate, interest rate, foreign private investment, total import and industrial capacity utilization rate were significant in the short run. The result advocated for appropriate short and long term policy packages that should focused on stabilization of the identified significant shifters of exchange rate volatility in the Nigeria’s economy. Harmonization of transactions in the various foreign exchange markets in Nigeria should be a priority objective in the current exchange rate policy.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

How family counsellors conceptualise their primary care family work","A number of current developments in the field potentially provide opportunities for preventative relationship and family interventions to be integrated into primary care. In this context, it is important to understand what family counselling is and how it might differ from family therapy. Thus, this paper investigates how the service of one low-intensity family counselling provider, Relate, is conceptualised and practised by counsellors on the ground. Questions about practice were posed to five focus groups of family counsellors and these were analysed using thematic analysis. The findings suggest that Relate family counselling is seen as ‘family therapy lite’, with a flexible, eclectic and integrative use of concepts and techniques within a systemic framework. Implications of this conceptualisation of family counselling for training, practice and research are discussed.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

As an example of how to use this relatively new discipline to enhance the acceptance and benefits of transportation pricing, its application to designing usage-based or pay-as-you-drive-and-you-save (PAYDAYS) insurance products is explored. Specifically, this research would apply lessons from behavioral economics to the marketing and designing of PAYDAYS insurance products to maximize profitability, consumer acceptance, and public benefits. By converting fixed insurance costs to per-mile or per-minute-of-driving charges, PAYDAYS insurance encourages voluntary reductions in driving and related decreases in congestion, air pollution, and crashes, and for these reasons has garnered substantial interest among government entities, environmental and other non-profit organizations, insurance companies, and consumers. General behavioral economics research findings strongly suggest substantial but rarely acknowledged differences in vehicle-miles traveled would result depending upon which PAYDAYS insurance product features, from a large variety of possibilities, are chosen. Behavioral economics demonstrates that how economic choices are framed for consumers affects the choices they make. The pricing levels and structure of different usage-based pricing plans affect initial purchasing decisions, customer retention, and usage. After summarizing the PAYDAYS insurance pricing schemes being tested in the U.S. marketplace, this paper examines the broadest array of existing and potential PAYDAYS insurance pricing attributes and their effects, at least directionally, on attracting and retaining customers and discouraging driving. Summary tables at the end identify target markets, product structure, and pricing and related attributes that would maximize participation and mileage reductions among participants. A pilot experiment design is proposed to increase understanding about the application of behavioral economics to PAYDAYS insurance. Public policy options to encourage PAYDAYS insurance generally, and the product attributes that lead to the best outcomes specifically (e.g., the greatest congestion and crash reductions), are discussed.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Employee spinoffs are defined either as the director/manager having moved from a parent in the same industry or as one-quarter of the employees having shifted from a common parent. Depending on definition, employee spinoffs account for between one-sixth and one-third of the new firms in Brazil's private sector during this period. Regardless of definition, size at entry is larger for employee spinoffs than for new firms without parents but smaller than for diversification ventures of existing firms. Similarly, exit rates for employee spinoffs are less than for new firms without parents and comparable to those for diversification ventures of existing firms.

To simplify the task of assessing potential mixture effects, we explored 3 land use-related chemical emission scenarios. We applied a tiered methodology to judge the implications of the emissions of chemicals from agricultural practices, domestic discharges, and urban runoff in a quantitative model. The results showed land use-dependent mixture exposures, clearly discriminating downstream effects of land uses, with unique chemical ""signatures"" regarding composition, concentration, and temporal patterns. Associated risks were characterized in relation to the land-use scenarios. Comparisons to measured environmental concentrations and predicted impacts showed relatively good similarity. The results suggest that the land uses imply exceedances of regulatory protective environmental quality standards, varying over time in relation to rain events and associated flow and dilution variation. Higher-tier analyses using ecotoxicological effect criteria confirmed that species assemblages may be affected by exposures exceeding no-effect levels and that mixture exposure could be associated with predicted species loss under certain situations. The model outcomes can inform various types of prioritization to support risk management, including a ranking across land uses as a whole, a ranking on characteristics of exposure times and frequencies, and various rankings of the relative role of individual chemicals. Though all results are based on in silico assessments, the prospective land use-based approach applied in the present study yields useful insights for simplifying and assessing potential ecological risks of chemical mixtures and can therefore be useful for catchment-management decisions.

In Uganda, several SMEs are emerging and their activities are having huge environmental impact hence contributing to global warming in form of carbon-dioxide release. There has been less effort to create awareness among public and private enterprises with an aim of reducing these negative effects. For example, water risks are rampant today, given population and climate change trends (www.ceres.org/), the demand for primary energy is projected to increase globally by a factor of 1.6 to 3.5 by the year 2050. Among developing countries, these factors are increasing from 2.3 to 5.2 (World Bank 2007). This study assessed corporate carbon financing strategies and competitiveness of small and Medium Enterprises with different management practices in Uganda. We used correlation analysis to find out whether there is significant relationship between company factors and competitiveness. The findings indicated Pearson correlation r = 0.435.The result of 0.435** was found to be higher than the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient critical values of 0.361.

When voting mechanisms allow for only one message type (simple voting mechanisms) we show that eliminating some conditions for strategic voting, individuals' optimal behavior coincides with an intuitive and common definition of sincerity. In order to obtain a precise definition of sincerity in voting mechanisms allowing for multiple message types (complex voting mechanisms) further restrictions on strategic voting are required. We illustrate our methodological approach using approval voting (AV) as a prime example of complex voting mechanisms for which no conclusive definition of sincerity exists in the literature.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Low-linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation is a source of noncancer pathologies in humans and little is known about the early events that could initiate subsequent diseases. However, it is well known that gamma radiation causes a very early disruption of the endothelial barrier at doses below those required for cytotoxic effects. After irradiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to doses as low as 2 Gy, transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) is transiently reduced at 3 h, and the platelet-derived endothothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1 or CD31) is uncoupled from the cells along with the release of endothelial microparticles (EMPs). In this study, we measured TEER reduction as an indicator of barrier function loss, and specifically examined the shedding of EMPs from human endothelial barrier models after a variety of low-LET irradiations, including photons and charged particles. Our findings showed two TEER responses, dependent on radiation type and environmental conditions. The first response was diminishing oscillations of TEER, which occurred during the first 10 h postirradiation. This response occurred after a 5 Gy proton or helium-ion (1 GeV/n) dose in addition to a 5 Gy gamma or X radiation dose. This occurred only in the presence of multiple growth factors and did not show a dose response, nor was it associated with EMP release. The second response was a single acute drop in TEER at 3 h after photon irradiation. Dose response was observed and was associated with the shedding of EMPs in 2D barrier cultures and in 3D vessel models. In this case, helium-ion and proton irradiations did not induce a drop in TEER or shedding of EMPs. The photon radiation effects was observed both in serum-free media and in the presence of multiple growth factors, indicating that it occurs under a range of environmental conditions. These results show an acute response of the human endothelial barrier that is relevant to photon irradiation. Significantly, it involves the release of EMPs, which have recently attracted attention due to their emerging clinical importance.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The paper offers an empirical study about the sources of pressure that make ATCs in Taiwan want to leave their jobs. Besides, another contribution of this study is to explore the relationships between turnover tendencies and two important factors, job stress and job satisfaction, among Taiwanese ATCs. We apply a path technique to analyze the proposed relationship model. The empirical results show that job satisfaction has a mediating effect on the relationships between the sources of job stress and turnover tendency. Additionally, the workload of job stressors had the most effect on turnover tendency, followed by family factors and job satisfaction. Work environment and role conflict were found to have indirect rather than direct effects on turnover tendency as mediated by job satisfaction. The results can provide valuable insights into the management of ATCs.","[{""country"":[""Taiwan, China""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, its molecular investigations are scarce. Here, we build a local database of BSH sequences from Lactobacillaceae (BSH–SDL), and phylogenetic analysis and homology searches were employed to elucidate their comparability and distinctiveness among species. Evolutionary study demonstrates that BSH sequences in BSH–SDL are divided into five groups, named BSH A, B, C, D and E here, which can be the genetic basis for BSH classification and nomenclature. Sequence analysis suggests the differences between BSH-active and BSH-inactive proteins clearly, especially on site 82. In addition, a total of 551 BSHs from 107 species are identified from 451 genomes of 158 Lactobacillaceae species. Interestingly, those bacteria carrying various copies of BSH A or B can be predicted to be potential cholesterol-lowering probiotics, based on the results of phylogenetic analysis and the subtypes that those previously reported BSH-active probiotics possess. In summary, this study elaborates the molecular basis of BSH in Lactobacillaceae systematically, and provides a novel methodology as well as a consistent standard for the identification of the BSH subtype. We believe that high-throughput screening can be efficiently applied to the selection of promising candidate BSH-active probiotics, which will advance the development of healthcare products in cholesterol metabolism.","[{""country"":[""China"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It positions itself at the junction of ethnography and autobiography, with a bit of fiction added in. I interweave autobiographical narrative concerning my father in the period pre-dating a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, with reflection, and hypothesis formulation, concerning my current research project on an ostensibly unrelated subject. My fieldwork focuses on the sovereign debt crisis in Athens, Greece and its impact on gendered and disparately nationalized subjectivities. I draw from personal life in yet another way here, as my research ‘field’ is where I currently live and work. Thus, the paper traces some of the ways with which emergent narratives based on physicalized crisis in ‘personal’ life, both my father’s Alzheimer’s and my own experience of national crisis discourse and austerity measures, produce ideas and writing that fuel ethnographic work on larger social realities, and their politics. Part of what surfaces at critical junctions, with some irony to be sure, is a broader process of self-exploration. Yet, part of the project here is to suggest that the ‘personal’ self, as we have come to know it in any case, as it is normalized and naturalized that is, should not be memorialized. The ability of individuals to adjust and survive, physically and emotionally, and the sharpening of critical theory aimed at resisting politics that totalize, whether the latter target people suffering from Alzheimer’s or populations in financial duress, are both contingent on the acknowledgement of the possibility that ‘preservation’ of a former sense of self is not necessarily beneficial. This paper argues that the self really is not something worthy of that much attention in those terms.

This study considers there to be three components of household food security (quantity, quality and stability), and attempts to address the “concept-to-measurement” gap in food security by building an index that spans these three dimensions. A panel data set from rural Zambia is used for descriptive analysis of food security indicators in 2001, 2004 and 2008. A multidimensional index of food security for rural Zambia is then developed using principal component analysis. We use this index to explore the spatial patterns of food security over time and to assess correlates of food security and impacts of climate shocks. Results indicate that both rainfall and temperature have a significant impact on a household’s food security score, though not for each individual component of the index. The paper concludes with a discussion of the merits and shortcomings of developing a composite food security index.","[{""country"":[""Zambia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Corporate governance is a system by which companies are controlled and managed. It is the structure of corporate governance that dictates how rights and responsibilities have to be distributed among role players such as members of the administrative board, managers, stockholders, and other beneficiaries. It also defines decision making procedures and regulations. Hence, considering the fact that corporate governance affects financial and non-financial variables, here we seek to find its impact on accounting outcomes and performance of companies and for this purpose we test the authenticity of the three following hypotheses: 1- Corporate governance has a significant impact on the future output of stocks. 2- Corporate governance has a significant impact on the future output of assets. 3- Corporate governance has a significant impact on uncommon promissory items. The statistical society included 448 companies who were admitted to Tehran Stock Market. Taking the research presuppositions into account and through systematic elimination method, 77 companies were selected as sample. To analyze data OLS regression test was used. The study findings revealed that strategies of corporate governance had significant impact on all three variables, i.e. future output of stocks, future output of assets and uncommon promissory items and the authenticity of all three hypotheses was confirmed.","[{""country"":[""Iran, Islamic Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

However, efforts to identify and subsequently remediate students' SRL in classroom contexts are still in the early stages of development. This study sought to examine individual differences in low and high achieving college students ( N = 41) in a classroom-based context in order to begin to inform remediation and intervention efforts. Results indicated no initial differences between high and low achieving students on prior knowledge, general ability, or self-efficacy. However, important differences emerged on metacognitive monitoring, reported use of low-level study strategies, and self-efficacy over the duration of the course. Test performance measured early in the course, but not baseline measures of SRL components or prior knowledge, was predictive of summative course achievement. Self-report measures of SRL did not align with measures of achievement, monitoring judgments, or interview data, indicating that these measures should be used with caution when examining SRL skills in college classroom contexts. Implications related to the development SRL skills are discussed.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

At the same time, no fortune teller would have been required, beyond picking the date of the elections themselves, to determine that minority issues would profoundly influence the future, as they have done since independence in 1948, and that 2010 would not witness resolution of these to-date intractable problems.1 The 7 November 2010 elections may have determined the composition of the new government, but they did not change, and specifically were not intended to change, the distribution of effective power, which still rests with the Tatmadaw (armed forces), and is likely to do so into the indefinite future. The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) efforts ineffectual at best to assuage the minorities are unlikely to succeed for several reasons. The minorities have wanted some form of federal system, and many groups have formulated draft constitutions (illegally under Myanmar law and thus they were forced to do so outside the country) for their seven constituent states that incorporated elements of some such preferred system. To the military, however, federalism has been anathema since Ne Win declared it so in 1962. He considered it the first step toward secession, against which the military has always fought since independence. The government's Border Guard Force concept (see below) has exacerbated tensions; it would result in the effective castration of the ceasefire military of key ethnic groups, and thus has been resisted. It is a subject with which the new government in 2011 will have to deal, and there are fears it may try to do so through military force.

HAV genome is not extensively variable, thus presenting opportunity for sharing sequences of subgenomic regions among genetically unrelated isolates. The degree of misrepresentation of phylogenetic relationships by subgenomic regions is especially important for tracking transmissions. Here, we analyzed whole-genome (WG) sequences of 101 HAV strains identified from 4 major multi-state, food-borne outbreaks of hepatitis A in the Unites States and from 14 non-outbreak-related HAV strains that shared identical VP1/P2B sequences with the outbreak strains. Although HAV strains with an identical VP1/P2B sequence were specific to each outbreak, WG were different, with genetic diversity reaching 0.31% (mean 0.09%). Evaluation of different subgenomic regions did not identify any other section of the HAV genome that could accurately represent phylogenetic relationships observed using WG sequences. The identification of 2-3 dominant HAV strains in 3 out of 4 outbreaks indicates contamination of the implicated food items with a heterogeneous HAV population. However, analysis of intra-host HAV variants from eight patients involved in one outbreak showed that only a single sequence variant established infection in each patient. Four non-outbreak strains were found closely related to strains from 2 outbreaks, whereas ten were genetically different from the outbreak strains. Thus, accurate tracking of HAV strains can be accomplished using HAV WG sequences, while short subgenomic regions are useful for identification of transmissions only among cases with known epidemiological association.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The significantly higher probability of adopting improved pulse varieties exists in extension services, influence of family member and encouragement of neighbour. Farmers' attitude toward improved pulse production was very positive since 63% of the adopters wanted to increase their present area for improved pulse production in the next year.

Jurisdictional Determinations, Hawkes, and Judicial Review","Under the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) is vested with the power to regulate “waters of the United States” by administering a statutorily mandated permit process. A preliminary part of this permit process is the issuance of a Jurisdictional Determination (“JD”), which declares whether the property in question is considered to contain “waters of the United States” subject to the permit process. There are two types of JDs: preliminary and approved. JDs can also be revised by the Corps for various reasons. Until the Eighth Circuit issued its decision in Hawkes v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, only approved JDs could be appealed, and only through the Corps administrative appeal process. Prior to Hawkes and under Belle Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, JDs were not subject to judicial review in the federal courts because according to the Fifth Circuit a JD is not a final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court, as required under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Hawkes, however, held that each of the criteria for reviewability was present in a JD, and that it was thus subject to judicial review. This split in the circuits will be short lived, as the Supreme Court has granted certiorari on Hawkes and will conclusively answer the question of a JD’s reviewability. The issue before the Court in Hawkes is whether a revised approved JD meets the requirements of finality and adequacy of remedy under the APA and is subject to judicial review. This Note seeks to provide the best framework for analyzing the reviewability of a JD, using the strongest arguments in support of Hawkes’ holding, while, at the same time, delineating the court’s proper role and its power of judicial review. It is the position of this Note that Hawkes was ultimately correct in its holding that a JD is subject to judicial review under the APA. However, the court’s rationale in Hawkes is flawed in two main respects. First, Hawkes inappropriately emphasizes the regulatory burden and impact of the permit process, and fails to make the stronger argument that a JD is, by † Editor-in-Chief, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW, Volume 11.

Whatever I accomplish is made possible because of God’s blessing and her support. 538 LIBERTY UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 10:537 its very nature, a final agency action. By focusing on the JD itself, the court could have clearly demonstrated that a JD not only creates an obligation to complete the permit process, but also determines rights of the landowner. Second, the court should have tempered its analysis with the concerns of Judge Kelly’s concurring opinion and should not have been so critical of the Corps and the cost and efficiency of the entire regulatory scheme. In its prudential critique of this scheme, the court transgressed it constitutional power of judicial review by wrongly answering a political question. The court in Hawkes should have avoided this critique and addressed only the matter before it. While the Supreme Court should affirm the holding in Hawkes, it should avoid such a prudential critique in its analysis of the issue. Overall, a proper understanding of the strengths and flaws of Hawkes will help yield the correct outcome on appeal and illustrate the appropriate analysis that should be used in the process.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The evolution of expected outputs over time is generated by the iteration of a noninvertible two-dimensional map. The long-run behavior is characterized by multistability, that is, the presence of coexisting stable consistent beliefs, which correspond to Nash equilibria in the quantity space. Hence, a problem of equilibrium selection arises and the long run outcome strongly depends on the choice of the players’ initial beliefs. We analyze the basins of attraction and their qualitative changes as the model parameters vary. We illustrate that the basins might be nonconnected sets and reveal the mechanism which is responsible for this often-neglected kind of complexity. The analysis of the global bifurcations which cause qualitative changes in the topological structure of the basins is carried out by the method of critical curves.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Competitive advantage through smart specialization can be promoted in all types of industries but based on the industry specific modes of innovation and knowledge bases, which is illustrated through case studies in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Depending on the preconditions, we find that variegated strategies of smart specialisation are pursued, including building the absorptive capacity of DUI based firms by increasing their research based competence (introducing analytical knowledge), combining unrelated knowledge bases to move into new related and unrelated industries, combining related knowledge bases to move into unrelated industries, and moving into high-value added niches by introducing symbolic knowledge in traditional sectors.","[{""country"":[""Denmark"",""Norway"",""Sweden""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The problem cannot be tackled solely by administrative, political or economic measures in isolation. It requires a holistic approach and a great deal of patience and understanding of the specific problems of different socio-cultural-ethnic groups. Since conflict between equity and efficiency is very sharp in the region, development projects must have social approval at the grass-root level given the diversities of population.

This review focuses on the sources of steroid estrogens in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The mechanisms and fate of steroid estrogens throughout the entire wastewater treatment system are also discussed, and relevant information on regulatory aspects is given. Municipal, pharmaceutical industry, and hospitals are the main sources of steroid estrogens that enter WWTPs. A typical WWTP comprises primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment units. Sorption and biodegradation are the main mechanisms for removal of steroid estrogens from WWTPs. The fate of steroid estrogens in WWTPs depends on the types of wastewater treatment systems. Steroid estrogens in the primary treatment unit are removed by sorption onto primary sludge, followed by sorption onto micro-flocs and biodegradation by microbes in the secondary treatment unit. Tertiary treatment employs nitrification, chlorination, or UV disinfection to improve the quality of the secondary effluent. Activated sludge treatment systems for steroid estrogens exhibit a removal efficiency of up to 100%, which is higher than that of the trickling filter treatment system (up to 75%).

However, various financial scandals and lawsuits involving them have raised questions regarding the governance and accountability of these organizations (Siino, 2004; Hamilton, 2006). As such, the insights from the literature on the issues of accounting and accountability in the religious-based organizations, especially the Islamic religious organisations are discussed. In so doing, the nature of religious-based organizations, and the practices of philanthropic institutions in an Islamic context are examined. In addition, the scale of accountability in and insights from previous researches on accounting and accountability practices of religious-based organizations are presented in this paper.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

If the artificial regulations which formerly kept industrial plants confined to core urban areas are abolished, then factories shift to rural areas in order to be close to the sources of farming raw materials, provided that the industrial transformation is sufficiently weight losing. However, the new productive sites for manufacturing will remain at a bounded distance from the Town, since they must bear the transport costs of shipping the output to the central meeting point where it must be transacted. Areas which are beyond this distance threshold are occupied by a traditional cottage economy, where goods are not carried to the Town but are rather produced for the household self-consumption. This framework also explains the observed fact that, within manufacturing, resource based branches are more centrally located in relation to core urban areas than other sectors.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We illustrate such use of rhetorical history by drawing on the case study of Ontario wine industry, where wineries use rhetorical history to demonstrate adherence to the logic of fine winemaking, while obscuring the industry’s past adherence to the now-subordinate and stigmatized logic of alcohol making.

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between paternal involvement and adverse birth outcomes in South Gujarat, India. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: An in-person questionnaire was administered to adult women at delivery or during the one-month postpartum visit at New Civil Hospital, in South Gujarat, India between May and June 2016 to assess level of paternal support and attendance at prenatal appointments and household structure. Pregnancy variables including birthweight and gestational age at delivery were collected from maternal and newborn record/chart review. Chi-square and t-test were used to assess demographics, as appropriate. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between paternal involvement and pregnancy birth outcomes. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: Of the 404 infants born during the study period, 26.7% were premature (<37 weeks gestation) and 29% were of low birth weight (<2500g). More than 40% of the women surveyed reported their in-laws were the primary household decision-makers; however, those who reported high paternal attendance were less likely to report in-laws as the primary decision-maker (p=0.03). Adjusted logistic regression analysis indicated the odds of delivering a low birth weight infant were greater among mothers who reported low paternal support and low paternal attendance at prenatal visits (OR=2.99 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.84-4.86) and OR=2.16 (95% CI: 1.35-3.47), respectively). ::: ::: ::: Conclusion And Global Health Implications ::: Low paternal support during pregnancy may be a missed opportunity to increase healthy practices during pregnancy as well as decrease the risks associated with limited social support during pregnancy. It is important to consider varying socio-cultural family dynamics in different populations and how they may influence paternal involvement during pregnancy.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Since 1989, over 167,000 parents of children adopted in other countries have needed to know the answer to that question. Adoption creates a parent-child relationship that is not legally different from a biologically created parent-child relationship. Parents are entitled to the same rights and owe the same obligations to adopted children as they do to biological children, and adopted children are entitled to the same benefits as biological children. Adopted children are entitled to the financial support of their parents to the same extent as biological children. Thus, in the event of a divorce, parents who adopted their children are responsible for the payment of child support to the same extent as parents who birthed their children. Adopted children are treated identically to biological children for purposes of inheritance. So, if children inherit under a state's intestate succession scheme, then adoptive and biological children both inherit. Adopted children are entitled to the same benefits as biological children under a parent's life or health insurance and under government entitlement programs like Social Security. In addition, the Family Medical Leave Act gives the same benefits to parents who add to their families by birth and those who add to their families by adoption. A legally valid adoption is a necessary precursor to recognition of the legal benefits just mentioned. With regard to adoptions that occur in countries outside the United States, under the laws of those foreign countries, the issue becomes whether those adoptions are valid in creating the legal parent-child relationship in the United States. Must state courts recognize the validity of a final decree of adoption from a foreign country? What would be the ramifications if courts did not recognize the validity of the foreign adoption? Should adoptive parents return their children to their native lands where often, but not always, economic and political conditions might threaten their well-being? Or should adoptive parents raise the children as their own, but with few or no legal rights for either the parents or the children? Rather than struggle with issues of varying common law rules, disparate state statutes, international treaties, and traditional versus nontraditional families, courts should adopt a child-centered approach for recognition of foreign decrees of adoption, focusing on the best interest of the child.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Despite this, relatively little is known about Arab foreign aid. The OECD development database offers a paucity of information, aggregating data for “Arab countries” and “Arab agencies,” without identifying the constituent units of either. A further complication is that Arab donors are not uniformly transparent about their aid efforts, publicizing some of them while keeping other donations secret. In this paper, we advance the state of knowledge of Arab foreign aid in a number of ways. We use AidData to document the trends in reported donations from specific bilateral donors (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) and multilateral agencies (Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, OPEC’s Fund for International Development, and the Islamic Development Bank). Notably, Arab bilateral donors have given less generously over time with aid levels remaining relatively stable despite skyrocketing national wealth. We explore reasons for this decline, including that Arab donors have: shifted their giving from bilateral to multilateral channels, given less as DAC donors have given more, and increased domestic spending at the expense of foreign aid with a view to safeguarding regime security. In addition, we look at the sectoral allocations of Arab bilateral and multilateral organizations, and compare the aid practices of Arab donors to their DAC counterparts. Finally, we suggest why an exclusive focus on aid commitments is problematic where Arab aid is concerned.","[{""country"":[""Kuwait"",""Saudi Arabia"",""United Arab Emirates""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The present work therefore examined the influence of nonverbal, dominance-related communicator cues on perceivers’ judgments of information delivered by the communicator. Specifically, this research assessed the impact of communicator clothing color (Studies 1a–1c) and facial width-to-height ratio (Study 2) on perceived information accuracy. Perceivers judged the information presented by the communicator to be more accurate when the communicator (a) was wearing red rather than white or blue, or (b) possessed a high versus low facial width-to-height ratio.

The study aims to analyze whether the change in the curriculum has brought any significant innovation regarding the teacher autonomy.

Enrolled shelters were examined using descriptive data methods. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The majority of shelters operating in Mississippi up to three weeks post-Katrina were FBO-managed. All of the operating FBO shelters in Mississippi that met the inclusion criteria were contacted with a response rate of 94%. Decisions were made by individuals or small groups in most shelters regarding opening, operating procedures, and closing. Most FBOs provided at least one enabling service to evacuees, and all utilized informal networks for sheltering operations. Only 25% of FBOs had disaster plans in place prior to Hurricane Katrina. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Faith-based organization shelters played a significant role in the acute phase of the Katrina disaster. Formal disaster training should be initiated for these organizations. Services provided by FBOs should be standardized. Informal networks should be incorporated into national disaster planning.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In recent years, however, increasing attention has been dedicated to the benefits of reducing emissions of non-CO2 GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide. Increased attention to the potential role of these gases in a GHG reduction policy increased the need for better data on the costs of non-CO2 GHG abatement for countries and regions outside of the US and the European Union (EU). Using a net present value calculation, this analysis develops regionally adjusted costs per mitigation option and marginal abatement cost curves by region for use in economic models. The result is worldwide cost estimates for methane and nitrous oxide from waste, energy and the industrial sectors. This paper also demonstrates the ability to significantly reduce greenhouse gases from these sectors with current technologies and the low cost of methane and nitrous oxide relative to CO reductions.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

ECG and continuous blood pressure (BP) from radial artery tonometry were obtained at 2100 on the first study night (baseline) and every subsequent 12 h of SD. Each measurement period included resting supine, seated, and seated performing computerized tasks and measured vigilance and executive function. Subjects were not supine in the periods between measurements. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and BP variability (BPV) was computed for cardiac parasympathetic modulation [high-frequency power (HF)], sympathetic modulation [low-frequency power (LF)], sympathovagal balance (LF/HF power of R-R variability), and BPV sympathetic modulation (at LF). All spectral data were expressed in normalized units [(total power of the components/total power-very LF) x 100]. Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), based on systolic BP and pulse interval powers, was also measured. Supine and sitting, BPV LF was significantly increased from baseline at 12, 24, and 36 h of SD. Sitting, HRV LF was increased at 12 and 24 h of SD, HRV HF was decreased at 12 h SD, and HRV LF/HF power of R-R variability was increased at 12 h of SD. BRS was decreased at 24 h of SD supine and seated. During the simple reaction time task (vigilance testing), the significantly increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic cardiac modulation and BRS extended through 36 h of SD. In summary, acute SD was associated with increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic cardiovascular modulation and decreased BRS, most consistently in the seated position and during simple reaction-time testing.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Climate models and crop yield datasets have errors, but the effects of these errors on regional scale crop models is not well categorized and understood. In this study we compare the effect of synthetic errors in temperature and precipitation observations on the hindcast skill of a process-based crop model and a statistical crop model. We find that errors in temperature data have a significantly stronger influence on both models than errors in precipitation. We also identify key differences in the responses of these models to different types of input data error. Statistical and process-based model responses differ depending on whether synthetic errors are overestimates or underestimates. We also investigate the impact of crop yield calibration data on model skill for both models, using datasets of yield at three different spatial scales. Whilst important for both models, the statistical model is more strongly influenced by crop yield scale than the process-based crop model. However, our results question the value of high resolution yield data for improving the skill of crop models; we find a focus on accuracy to be more likely to be valuable. For both crop models, and for all three spatial scales of yield calibration data, we found that model skill is greatest where growing area is above 10-15 %. Thus information on area harvested would appear to be a priority for data collection efforts. These results are important for three reasons. First, understanding how different crop models rely on different characteristics of temperature, precipitation and crop yield data allows us to match the model type to the available data. Second, we can prioritize where improvements in climate and crop yield data should be directed. Third, as better climate and crop yield data becomes available, we can predict how crop model skill should improve.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This included the Ba 9 and Ba 47 in both right and left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the right anterior cingulate (Ba 32), all of which are associated with semantic searching and decision-making. Comparison between young and old participants showed that the latter had a significantly higher activation in the hippocampal formation, which was more predominant in the left hemisphere. Background Semantic memory is the basis on which we organize and understand our interaction with the world. This memory is known to be affected in normal aging, which manifests primarily in naming problems, probably because naming places a critical and heavy load on semantic processing. We designed a naming test to study the semantic memory decline in normal aging and to detect brain areas and activation patterns associated with object naming performance (Gigi, Babai, Katzav, Atkins, & Hendler, Discussion The brain patterns detected in the young population, suggests an important role of the PFC in naming of objects seen from unusual viewpoints. Since there is a loss of frontal grey matter with age, this might explain (at least in part) the observed age-decline in naming performance. Over activation of the hippocampal formation in the old population, during naming performance, might represent a compensatory attempt. This is in accordance with a recent study showing the contribution of the hippocampus to semantic processing of visual objects (Vannucci et al., Methodology Naming Performance was studied behaviorally on 117 participants aged 20 to 75 years old. Cerebral activation patterns were studied using functional-MRI (fMRI) on 18 healthy participants. Nine young participants (aged 20-30) and nine old participants (aged 60-78). The test included two types of pictured stimuli. One, common objects that were pictured from a conventional viewpoint (usual condition), and the other condition included common objects that were pictured form a non- conventional viewpoint (unusual condition). The stimuli were presented in a block-design fashion and the participants were asked to name the objects as fast and as accurate as they could. Correct responses and Reaction Time (RT) were measured in the behavioral study. Acknowledgments The study was supported by the Smith grant (No. 2004-41) of the National Institute for Psychobiology in Israel. Results In the usual condition the percent of correct responses was high and remained stable (93%-94%) across the ages 20 to 70. Decline in performance was only evident above 70 years of age. In the unusual condition the naming performance was significantly lower in all age groups (66% of correct responses in average). Moreover, age-related naming decline for this condition was evident already from 40 years of age. Reaction times, on the contrary, showed a consistent increase with age in the usual as well as in the unusual conditions. References Gigi, A., Babai, R., Katzav, E., Atkins, S., & Hendler, T. (2005).

We find that investors with a higher exposure to financial savvy people are more likely to invest in stocks. This holds after controlling for a wide range of known stock market participation determinants. Moreover when restricting to households with elevated levels of trust or wealth the impact of exposure to financial savvy people increases.

Conversely, below average students who share classrooms with would-be dropouts are greatly harmed by raising the dropout age. Overall, below-average white and above-average black students have experienced some negative consequences from more stringent schooling laws, while Hispanics have tended to benefit.

An important result, related to one shown previously, is that mean donations to the public good do not converge to zero as the economy grows large. Other results are new and comparable to those from the standard model of a privately provided public good. The Nash equilibrium is solved explicitly to show how individual direct donations and net contributions depend on wealth and heterogenous preferences. Comparative static analysis demonstrates how the level of the public good and social welfare depend on the technology, individual wealth, and an initial level of the public good. Application of the model in an environmental context establishes a starting point for understanding and making predictions about markets such as those for carbon offsets.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Program acceptability was assessed through four focus groups with 40 young new drivers (YND), two with 19 parents of YNDs, and two with 15 community members. To determine whether the program's design, materials, and procedures were working as planned, 51 families participated in a six month pilot project. Telephone and in-person interviews were conducted at months 1 and 6, respectively. ::: ::: Results: Participants had problems with the acceptability of the program's underlying message; content, format, and language of the materials; program cost; and proposed participant incentives. Thirty eight (75%) families completed the six month pilot. Most YNDs (75%) and parents (85%) identified the contract as a useful communication tool. Despite positive initial reactions, 50% of YNDs did not recall the content of the contract after six months. Sixty eight percent of families had problems with the decal (for example, did not stay affixed, colors faded) and only 17% of YNDs reported a lasting impact on their driving. Only 20% of families chose to continue in the program after the pilot. ::: ::: Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of formative and process evaluation in the development of a new prevention strategy to assess a strategy's acceptability and feasibility. In response to participants' feedback, revisions made to the program's materials and delivery model included making its two key components—the contract and decal—available online, independent of each other, and free of charge.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Rather, the avoidance canon first requires judges to engage in a preliminary factual inquiry to determine whether a litigant’s claim poses a risk of requiring constitutional adjudication at all. Drawing from the administrative law context, this Comment refers to that analysis as the Step Zero inquiry. For each of three paradigmatic statutory interpretation cases, the Comment describes how the majority employs the avoidance canon only after reaching a initial factual determination of constitutional doubt. Increased awareness of this Step Zero avoidance inquiry will reduce instrumental judicial behavior, force deliberation among the judiciary to determine the appropriate Step Zero threshold, and provide the optimal incentives for litigants and Congress. This Comment concludes by recommending additional avenues for scholarly exploration on this topic.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Five studies provided strong evidence for the separation of these 2 goal constructs: Separation was observed not only with exploratory factor analysis across different age groups and countries (Studies 1a and 1b) but also with change analysis (Study 2), ipsative factor analysis (Study 3), within-person analysis (Study 4), and behavioral genetics analysis (Study 5).

We analyze these initiatives against the backdrop of modern India's political evolution which has seen the marginalization of upper and middle classes in politics. We see technology as central to the re-engagement of ICT-savvy upper and middle classes with the political sphere.

However, it is still unclear how MGP may be involved in crystal formation in the kidney of hyperoxaluric rats. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the hyperoxaluric group and control group. Hyperoxaluric rats were administrated by 0.75% ethylene glycol (EG) for up to 8 weeks. Renal MGP expression was detected by the standard avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method. Renal crystal deposition was observed by a polarizing microscope. Total RNA and protein from the rat kidney tissue were extracted. The levels of MGP mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Hyperoxaluria was induced successfully in rats. The MGP was polarly distributed, on the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells, and was found in the ascending thick limbs of Henle's loop (cTAL) and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) in hyperoxaluric rats, its expression however, was present in the medullary collecting duct (MCD) in stone-forming rats. Crystals with multilaminated structure formed in the injurious renal tubules with lack of MGP expression.MGP mRNA expression was significantly upregulated by the crystals' stimulations. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our results suggested that the MGP was involved in crystals formation by the continuous expression, distributing it polarly in the renal tubular cells and binding directly to the crystals.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

While Uu is sensitive to erythromycin in vitro, the efficacy of intravenous (IV) erythromycin to eliminate Uu from the airways has not been studied.Methods17 very low birth weight infants with Uu positive tracheal aspirate (TA) cultures were randomized to either 5 (8 infants) or 10 days (9 infants) of IV erythromycin lactobionate (40 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses). Tracheal aspirate cultures for Uu were performed on days 0, 5, 10 and 15.ResultsIntravenous erythromycin failed to eliminate airway colonization in a large proportion of infants regardless of whether they received 5 or 10 days of treatment. Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated from 4/15 (27%) of TAs obtained at 5 days, 5/12 TAs (42%) obtained at 10 days and 6/11(55%) TAs obtained at 15 days (combined group data).ConclusionsErythromycin administered IV does not eliminate Uu from the airways in a large proportion of infants. Failure of erythromycin to eliminate Uu from the airways may contribute to the lack of efficacy of this drug in reducing the incidence of BPD in very low birth weight infants.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

""Why is the Government paying people $50 to discuss the Chief Minister's pool laws when there are thousands of Territorians who can do this for free? ""What are the questions that will be put to the focus groups? ""If taxpayers are paying for these focus groups the questions should be made public so that there can be no doubt that the focus groups are more about Labor Party polling than they are about the Chief Minister's pool laws. ""The public has every right to be suspicious about the Government using their money to poll people about the pool laws.

Fifty-two females participated in both a betrayal interview and a structured interview, during which blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. Spirituality, as assessed by the Spiritual Well-being Scale, was associated with perceived stress, subjective well-being, and medication use. The Existential Well-being subscale predicted fewer physical health symptoms and was associated with lower mean heart rate and decreased heart rate reactivity. The Religious Well-being subscale was associated with reduced systolic blood pressure reactivity in response to the structured interview. These findings suggest that spirituality may have a salutary effect on health, even in a fairly young sample. While previous studies have predominantly reported that religion, as well as spirituality, have a health protective effect, this study did not find strong support for that conclusion. Religiosity in this age group may still be undergoing developmental maturity, which may explain the lack of relationships to health.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The findings are consistent with the theoretical view that advanced services offshoring must be understood as an antecedent for strategic business development and organizational change in both home and host firms. The study shows that when offshoring partnerships mature and firms gain experience, learning in both home and host firms evolves over time and differs in many cases from their initial objectives and expectations.

Recent studies showed that gamma irradiation causes selective impairment of nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. The goal of our study was to identify mechanisms underlying the impairment of NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation after whole-body irradiation with a cobalt60 source. We compared vasodilation and NO release induced by acetylcholine (ACh), as well as relaxations induced by exogenous NO, in the thoracic aorta from healthy and irradiated rabbits. It was shown that despite the loss of relaxation the apparent release of NO induced by ACh and detected by chemiluminescence assay remained unaltered in irradiated tissue, as compared with that of healthy rabbits. At the same time, it was evident that while in healthy vessels relaxation increased with increasing NO concentration;, this relationship was lost in irradiated vessels. Endothelium-denuded aortic smooth muscles from irradiated rabbits retained the same sensitivity to NO gas solution as healthy denuded vessels. When non-denuded vascular tissues were used, irradiated aortas demonstrated an increased sensitivity, as compared with non-irradiated vascular tissue. α-Tocopherol acetate and phosphatidylcholine liposomes, when administered to rabbits 1 h after irradiation, effectively restored the NO-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation and normalized the relationship between NO release and relaxation and also the sensitivity of the vessels to inhibition by Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA). Taken together, these data allow us to hypothesize that inhibition of an EDRF/NO-dependent component of vascular relaxation in irradiated rabbits may be due to at least two possible reasons: (i) intensified inactivation of endothelium-derived NO by oxygen free radicals, and (ii) abnormalities in diffusion of NO in the irradiated endothelium and subendothelial layer. Both these effects may lead to a decrease in the bioavailability of NO.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The Use and Interpretation of Housing Standards in Tenancy Tribunals in New Zealand","This article explores the content and interpretation of the minimum housing quality standards that apply to the rental sector in New Zealand, considering their place within the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. It shows that housing quality standards remains unclear and scattered over several Acts, and then provides evidence of the way these often relatively vague standards are applied in practice – and thus the expectations that tenants can expect of their house’s indoor environment, and the responsibilities this places on those offering housing for rent. It argues that the association between cold, damp housing and health is reflected in housing standards legislation only to the extent that adjudicators apply the dampness standard contained in the Housing Improvement Regulations 1947, incorporated into the landlord’s obligations by s 45(1)(c) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. However, the application by adjudicators of these standards through compensation and termination of tenancies for breaches is variable, and the lack of a clear and well-publicised standard prevents a robust enforcement of obligations of landlords to provide adequate housing to tenants.","[{""country"":[""New Zealand""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Estimation results suggest that the crisis affected these dynamics differently across banks, which implies that policy implications are uneven. This has important consequences regarding the effectiveness of monetary and the macroprudential policy, which prompt policymakers to consider ownership in policy design. To enhance policy effectiveness, adding ownership-specific explanatory variables may enable better representation of the non-performing loan dynamics. A vintage loan analysis may also help by allowing policymakers to directly identify the loan type, which generates non-performing loans.","[{""country"":[""Turkey""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Although studies have been conducted to derive dietary patterns among Malaysians, their consistency across subgroups has not been examined. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: The study aimed to derive dietary patterns empirically and to examine the consistency and generalizability of patterns across sex, ethnicity, and urban status in a working population. ::: ::: ::: DESIGN ::: This was a cross-sectional study using data from the Clustering of Lifestyle Risk Factors and Understanding its Association with Stress on Health and Well-Being among School Teachers in Malaysia study collected between August 2014 and November 2015. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis. ::: ::: ::: PARTICIPANTS/SETTING ::: Participants were teachers from selected public schools from three states in Peninsular Malaysia (n=4,618). ::: ::: ::: MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES ::: Dietary patterns derived using factor analysis. ::: ::: ::: STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED ::: Separate factor analysis was conducted by sex, ethnicity, and urban status to identify dietary patterns. Eigenvalue >2, scree plot, Velicer's minimum average partial analysis, and Horn's parallel analysis were used to determine the number of factors to retain. The interpretability of each dietary pattern was evaluated. The consistency and generalizability of dietary patterns across subgroups were assessed using the Tucker congruence coefficient. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: There was no subgroup-specific dietary pattern found. Thus, dietary patterns were derived using the pooled sample in the final model. Two dietary patterns (Western and Prudent) were derived. The Western dietary pattern explained 15.4% of total variance, characterized by high intakes of refined grains, animal-based foods, added fat, and sugar-sweetened beverages as well as fast food. The Prudent dietary pattern explained 11.1% of total variance and was loaded with pulses, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The derived Western and Prudent dietary patterns were consistent and generalizable across subgroups of sex, ethnicity, and urban status. Further research is needed to explore associations between these dietary patterns and chronic diseases.","[{""country"":[""Malaysia""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Since then, all vocational teachers have to complete the same course, regardless of practical work experience and educational background. After completion, they apply the knowledge to a very specific practice (i.e. teaching within a specific vocational field at a specific type of college). Thus, individual teachers experience different ‘learning trajectories’, depending on the vocational field and place of employment. They amass different experiences, including going back to school, just like newly enrolled students at a vocational college. This paper is based on empirical data from a qualitative study. It examines the learning trajectories of vocational teachers who choose to return to vocational colleges as VET teachers. Based on the analyses of two cases, we discuss the consequences for teachers’ pedagogical practice at vocational colleges and its potential for solving various challenges that colleges face.","[{""country"":[""Denmark""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

To understand how people manage the risk of water scarcity and growing pressures of increased climate variability, exploring perceptions of risk and how these perceptions feed into response behaviour and willingness to adapt is critical. This paper revisits existing frameworks that conceptualise perceptions of environmental risk and decision-making, and uses empirical evidence from an in-depth study conducted in Rajasthan, India, to emphasise how individual and collective memories, and experience of past extreme events shape current definitions and future expectations of climatic risks. In doing so, we demonstrate the value of recognising the role of local perceptions of water scarcity (and how they vary between and within households) in constructing social vulnerability. This expanded understanding of risk perception is critical for incentivising individual adaptation and strengthening local adaptation pathways.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data"",""Geospatial Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A Cross-Country Analysis based on Choice Experiments","Transition towards a low-carbon energy system is critically dependent on social acceptance by individuals, investors, markets, and society as a whole. Over the few past decades, a steady stream of research has examined social acceptance of renewable energy technologies (Batel and Devine-Wright, 2015; Stigka et al., 2014; Wustenhagen et al., 2007). Despite being one of the most cost-effective sources of renewable electricity, wind parks face intense local opposition, especially near residential areas (Soderholm et al., 2007; Wolsink, 2007). The environmental justice literature suggests that social acceptance of renewable energy can be increased by respecting procedural justice (fair, participatory planning processes) and distributional justice (fairly allocating costs and benefits). However, empirical evidence about how justice considerations play out with respect to the expansion of wind power is scarce. To close this gap, we conducted a choice experiment, jointly testing the influence of procedural and distributional justice on social acceptance, in combination with other factors, such as a wind project’s environmental impacts, location, and ownership. Geographically, this study focuses on Eastern Switzerland, Western Estonia, and Southern Ukraine, which were identified as regions with high potential for wind power development. Such a set-up allows comparison of social acceptance in three countries that have different histories, levels of economic development, availability of natural resources, and electricity market structures. ::: ::: Methods and Data ::: The analysis is based on a large-scale online survey of more than 2,000 respondents, which was conducted in January-February of 2017 in Estonia and Ukraine and in July-August of 2015 in Switzerland. In a series of conjoint-based choice tasks, respondents were asked to choose among potential wind parks to be constructed near their communities. The wind projects differed with respect to their location, project developer, revenue sharing scheme, possibility of public engagement, as well as ecological impacts. The survey also collected information on respondents’ beliefs about wind energy and its perceived impacts on the landscape and local economies. Furthermore, the survey soliticed the respondents’ climate change perceptions, worldviews, and key socio-demographic variables. ::: ::: Results ::: In general, 96% of Ukrainian, 87% of Estonian, and 74% of Swiss respondents were in favour or somewhat in favor of wind energy development in their countries, and the majority of the respondents would not be disturbed by living within sight of a wind turbine. Despite current low rates of deployment, the Ukrainian respondents were the most optimistic about the share of electricity that will be generated from renewable sources in the coming 5-10 years. The respondents in different countries had somewhat diverging concerns about wind energy. For example, only about 10% percent of Ukrainian and Swiss respondents perceived a link between wind turbines and health problems, in contrast to 42% of Estonian respondents. The major area of concern for the Estonian respondents related to real estate prices in the vicinity of wind turbines. ::: Despite their differences, local populations in all three countries held similar preferences with respect to the most desireble project features. Based on an evaluation of part-worth utilities, projects with the smallest impacts on local flora and fauna were most preferred. With respect to project location, respondents were most willing to accept wind parks in industrial and commercial zones and on agricultural land, rather than in ecologically significant regions or near residential areas. This is in line with previous studies showing the significance of the landscape and environmental impacts for local acceptance (e.g., Alvarez-Farizo and Hanley, 2002; Meyerhoff et al., 2010). ::: Electric utilities were viewed as the most suitable project developers. This confirms prior findings demonstrating that local ownership has a significant positive effect on acceptance (Bergmann et al., 2006; Warren and McFadyen, 2010). Interestingly, Estonian respondents viewed project development by individuals positively, as well as revenue sharing with local private landowners. By contrast, Swiss and Ukrainian respondents preferred revenue sharing with the municipality and all residents. ::: Engagement of the local population also contributes to social acceptance, but certain participation opportunities were viewed more positively than others. For example, having a public informational meeting or informational brochure and a website was not found to greatly increase a project’s social acceptance. Yet, direct participation of the local population in determining the number and location of wind turbines was connected to higher social acceptance. Studies by Gross (2007) and Ek and Persson (2014) also confirmed that local participation in the planning process, and the transfer of revenue to a local community has a positive influence on social acceptance. ::: ::: Preliminary conclusions ::: The survey demonstrates high social acceptance of wind energy in Switzerland, Estonia, and Ukraine. Based on results from the discrete choice experiment, it was shown that minimizing ecological impacts of wind projects could significantly increase social acceptance. This finding underlines the importance of environmental impacts analyses, which can be seen as an instrument to secure social acceptance. The background of the project delevoper is found to be important for local population: the respondents in all three countries preferred the projects to be carried out by local utilities, either alone or in collaboration with a specialized investor. The involvement of foreign utilities is viewed with skepticism. Thus, keeping wind power projects local and nature-friendly are the two most important attributes influencing social acceptance among residents. ::: Furthermore, we find that wind power’s potential to reduce energy import dependence, add value to the local economy and lower carbon emissions are key arguments that resonate with the population, while concerns remain with regard to the potential impact of wind projects on health and local real estate prices.","[{""country"":[""Estonia"",""Switzerland"",""Ukraine""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this study, we examine these supports in both home and school contexts during children’s critical transitional kindergarten year. Participants were 70 children living in 2 different communities: neighborhoods of concentrated poverty (i.e., poverty rates over 40%) and borderline neighborhoods (i.e., poverty rates of 20–40%). From an ecological perspective, our goal was to examine the quantity and quality of knowledge-building supports in these contexts, and their relationship to children’s school readiness outcomes. Interactive parent-child tasks were designed to elicit child-directed language in the home, while naturalistic observations in the kindergarten classrooms captured teachers’ child-directed language. Children living in concentrated poverty were more likely to experience language of more limited complexity and diversity in both home and kindergarten contexts as compared to children living in borderline communities. We argue that the “double dose of disadvantage” in the language supports children receive at home and at school may affect their school readiness in significant, yet distinct, ways.

We estimate the effect of lower fertility on carbon emissions accounting for the fact that changes in fertility patterns affect carbon emissions through three channels: total population, the age structure of the population, and economic output. Our analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we estimate a version of the STIRPAT equation on an unbalanced yearly panel of cross-country data from 1950-2010. We demonstrate that the coefficient on population is nearly seven times larger than the coefficient on income per capita and that this difference is statistically significant. Thus, regression results imply that 1% slower population growth could be accompanied by an increase in income per capita of nearly 7% while still lowering carbon emissions. In the second part of our analysis, we use a recently constructed economic-demographic model of Nigeria to estimate the effect of lower fertility on carbon emissions accounting for the impacts of fertility on population growth, population age structure, and income per capita. The model was constructed to estimate the effect of lower fertility on economic growth, making it well-suited for this application. We find that by 2100 C.E., moving from the medium to the low variant of the UN fertility projection leads to 35% lower yearly emissions and 15% higher income per capita. These results strongly suggest that population policies should be a part of the approach to combating global climate change.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, some recent studies suggest that traditional form of political participation especially among youth has been declining in developed and developing countries which may likely create uncertain future for democracy. For instance, in many countries youth are not stimulated by the traditional media such as Radio, Television and Newspaper. Conversely, other findings illustrate the sudden and unprecedented increase in youth engagement in political activities through the use of Facebook. Youth now have access to political information and interact directly with political candidates. Nevertheless, researchers have not clearly examined why youth political participation suddenly changed and what it’s the driving force is. In posing these questions, scholars have suggested that certain features of Facebook such as usage pattern, diversity network of Facebook friends and interactivity with political figures should be examined. The paper therefore concludes that there exists a positive linkage between Facebook usage and youth political participation. © 2016 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.uk","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In terms of the high cost of rail transit systems, land value capture has drawn increasing attention as a result of its potential for funding public transport infrastructure. To evaluate its potential success, it is crucial to examine critically the impact of public transport on land value before approaching the question of land value capture. This paper considers how the introduction of a rail transit system can lead to land value changes using the extension to Sunderland of the Tyne and Wear Metro (UK) as a case study. Changes in land values, specifically residential land prices, have been investigated using residential property prices data from local newspapers. This paper presents a statistical analysis of residential property price change in the vicinity of Sunderland Metro stations together with the results on the significance of land value uplift associated with the Metro in Sunderland. The results are discussed in the context of previous studies of the Tyne and Wear Metro before the Sunderland extension was planned. The paper concludes with a discussion of the reasons for the results.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This work presents sequence analysis of ovine TLR7 and TLR8 genes, depicts novel mutations and describes frequencies of mutations in Maedi Visna infected and healthy sheep. Totally 48 samples of the breed Tsigai were analyzed for the presence of mutations. Within 20 mutations, 14 were silent whereas 6 were missense. The frequencies of missense mutations in the Maedi Visna infected compared to non-infected sheep were: Lys115Glu (P-0.766, F-test), Asn117 (P-0.380) and Lys818Arg (P-0.739). These three mutations were localized in extra LRR (lucine rich repeat) region of TLR7, while mutation Ile73Leu (P-0.498) was located within LRR2 motif. Both mutations in TLR8, Asn165Lys (P-1.0) and Tyr349His (P-0.700), were present in extra LRR region. The secondary structure analysis of ovine TLR7 and TLR8 revealed conserved LRR motif structure, however with some irregularities compared to cattle and human. Transmembrane domains of TLR7 and TLR8 showed 100% homology between sheep and cattle wherein no mutations were found. In both TLRs TIR domains were highly conserved with occurrence of 4 silent mutations. Mutations in TLR7 and TLR8 may play an important role as predisposition factor for Maedi Visna infection. Considering the sequence homology among sheep, cattle and human genes encoding TLR7 and TLR8, we predict their similar function, localization and downstream signaling.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) on platelet aggregation and dityrosine concentration in CHF patients and healthy controls. Materials and Methods: CHF patients (n = 67) and healthy (n = 31) were investigated. Heart echoscopy, 6-min walking test, complete blood count, platelet aggregation, and dityrosine concentration were performed. Platelet aggregation and dityrosine concentration were measured in plasma samples after incubation with different HOCl concentrations (0.15, 0.0778, and 0.0389 mmol/L). Results: Platelet aggregation without oxidant was lower (p = 0.049) in CHF patients than in controls. The spontaneous platelet aggregation with oxidant added was higher in CHF patients (p = 0.004). Dityrosine concentration was also higher (p = 0.032) in CHF patients. Platelet aggregation was the highest in samples with the highest oxidant concentration in both healthy controls (p = 0.0006) and in CHF patients (p = 0.036). Platelet aggregation was higher in NYHA III group in comparison to NYHA II group (p = 0.0014). Concentration of dityrosine was significantly higher in CHF samples (p = 0.032). The highest concentration of dityrosine was obtained in NYHA IV group samples (p < 0.05). Intensity of platelet aggregation, analyzed with ADP, was correlated with LV EF (r = 0.42, p = 0.007). Dityrosine concentration was correlated with NYHA functional class (r = 0.27, p < 0.05). Conclusions: The increase in platelet aggregation in CHF and healthy controls shows the oxidant effect on platelets. The increase in dityrosine concentration in higher NYHA functional classes shows a higher oxidative stress in patients with worse condition.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The observed pricing patterns can be explained by firms engaging in short-term price promotions in an attempt to avoid the deleterious outcome associated with price competition.

Antibiotic-mediated disruptions to the gut microbiota and associated metabolome promote C. difficile growth and infection through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, we show that intestinal bile acids, which are known to play a role in C. difficile germination and outgrowth, also directly bind and inhibit TcdB toxin, the primary virulence determinant of C. difficile. Bile acid binding induces a major conformational change in TcdB structure that prevents receptor binding and uptake into cells. In addition to suggesting a role for bile acids in protecting against C. difficile pathogenesis, these findings highlight an approach to block C. difficile virulence. Intestinal bile acids are known to modulate the germination and growth of Clostridioides difficile. Here we describe a role for intestinal bile acids in directly binding and neutralizing TcdB toxin, the primary determinant of C. difficile disease. We show that individual primary and secondary bile acids reversibly bind and inhibit TcdB to varying degrees through a mechanism that requires the combined oligopeptide repeats region to which no function has previously been ascribed. We find that bile acids induce TcdB into a compact “balled up” conformation that is no longer able to bind cell surface receptors. Lastly, through a high-throughput screen designed to identify bile acid mimetics we uncovered nonsteroidal small molecule scaffolds that bind and inhibit TcdB through a bile acid-like mechanism. In addition to suggesting a role for bile acids in C. difficile pathogenesis, these findings provide a framework for development of a mechanistic class of C. difficile antitoxins.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Value of education in post-socialist Poland","The ""motivation"" for this study is the change of the occupational structure and the subsequent increase in employment opportunities especially for white-collar professionals, whose situation was comparatively weak under socialist rule. In this paper, it is assumed that the situation of university-educated people improved considerably in Poland as well as in most other transitional economies, when the business sector opened up and new opportunities in private enterprises started to emerge in the beginning of the 1990's. Thus, the central research task of this article is related to the value of education before and after the Polish transition from a socialist system to one characterised by a market economy and a free parliamentary system. It is also assumed that both for ideological reasons (abandonment of Marxist-Leninist glorification of manual work and industrial production) and practical reasons (expansion of possibilities for non-technically educated university graduates), the transition was a great divider that affected also the value of education, among many other things. Empirical research questions can be formulated as follows: What kind of an effect did the transition to post-socialism have on the value of education? Has the value of education declined as in most other countries, or has it risen as a consequence of market-liberalist changes? Special attention is paid to the situation of highly educated people, and also to differences according to gender.","[{""country"":[""Poland""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Analytical results were weighted by both component counts and mitigation size. Overall mitigation success (including preservation) was estimated at 74 % (SE = 3 %) for wetlands and 75 % (SE = 4 %) for streams in NC. Compared to the results of previous studies, wetland mitigation success rates had increased since the mid-1990s. Differences between mitigation providers (mitigation banks, NC Ecosystem Enhancement Program’s design-bid-build and full-delivery programs, NC Department of Transportation and private permittee-responsible mitigation) were generally not significant although permittee-responsible mitigation yielded higher success rates in certain circumstances. Both wetland and stream preservation showed high rates of success and the stream enhancement success rate was significantly higher than that of stream restoration. Additional statistically significant differences when mitigation size was considered included: (1) the Piedmont yielded a lower stream mitigation success rate than other areas of the state, and (2) recently constructed wetland mitigation projects demonstrated a lower success rate than those built prior to 2002. Opportunities for improvement exist in the areas of regulatory record-keeping, understanding the relationship between post-construction establishment and long-term ecological trajectories of stream and wetland restoration projects, incorporation of numeric ecological metrics into mitigation monitoring and success criteria, and adaptation of stream mitigation designs to achieve greater success in the Piedmont.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Responsiveness of these receptors is decreased in diabetic angiopathy, in contrast to inflammation, where this responsiveness is increased. Considering these opposite effects, the aim of this study was to investigate the vasodilatory response of knee joint blood vessels to salbutamol (a Beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist) in inflamed joints of diabetic rats. Methods: Acute knee joint inflammation was induced by intraarticular injection of kaolin 4% and induction of diabetes was performed by streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). Wistar rats weighting 200-300 g were used. The animals were divided in 5 groups; control, saline, diabetic, inflammatory and diabetic-inflammatory. Blood flow of knee joint was measured using laser Doppler flowmeter technique (LDF). Vasodilatation of articular micro vasculature was measured in response to topical application of different concentration of salbutamol (10 -11 -10 -1 M). Results: Data obtained in this study showed that: 1- Acute inflammation caused significantly less increments in knee joint diameter and perimeter in diabetic compared to non-diabetic rats. 2- Responsiveness of Beta-2 adrenoceptors was increased in kaolin-induced acute inflammation in non-diabetic rats. 3- In diabetic rats, kaolin-induced acute inflammation could not increase the responsiveness of Beta-2 adrenoceptors. Conclusion: We conclude that diabetes inhibits the increasing effects of acute inflammation on responsiveness of Beta-2 adrenoceptors.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It finds that the effect of state aid on regional cohesion is ambiguous, partly because state aid is not proportionally granted to the most needy regions.

This paper makes an attempt to incorporate benefits from unpaid public services into consumption decisions to arrive at more accurate measures of poverty and inequality. The analysis is based on primary data collected from 40 villages in Bihar in 2012. We consider three types of public services: schooling, health care and subsidized food grains through the Public Distribution System (PDS). We show that accounting for the use of these services leads to a narrowing of the consumer expenditure distribution and lower inequality in Bihar because the poor utilize the public facilities more intensively than other households. However, we also find that such accounting leads to a rise in the regional dispersion in poverty rates. So while the targeting within villages leads to a fall in the overall inequality, facilities are not always located in the poorest villages. Finally, we show that the changes in measured poverty from all three types of public services are positively correlated and there is clustering in the location of publicly provided goods. It is likely that this clustering has implications for growth since investments in education, health and nutrition are estimated to have high marginal returns in the literature and have also been shown to be an important historical precondition for growth many parts of the world.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In order to develop arithmetic expertise, children must understand arithmetic principles, such as the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction, in addition to learning calculation skills. We report two experiments that investigate children's understanding of the principle of inversion and the relationship between their conceptual understanding and arithmetical skills. ::: ::: ::: ::: Sample. A group of 127 children from primary schools took part in the study. The children were from 2 age groups (6–7 and 8–9 years). ::: ::: ::: ::: Methods. Children's accuracy on inverse and control problems in a variety of presentation formats and in canonical and non-canonical forms was measured. Tests of general arithmetic ability were also administered. ::: ::: ::: ::: Results. Children consistently performed better on inverse than control problems, which indicates that they could make use of the inverse principle. Presentation format affected performance: picture presentation allowed children to apply their conceptual understanding flexibly regardless of the problem type, while word problems restricted their ability to use their conceptual knowledge. Cluster analyses revealed three subgroups with different profiles of conceptual understanding and arithmetical skill. Children in the ‘high ability’ and ‘low ability’ groups showed conceptual understanding that was in-line with their arithmetical skill, whilst a 3rd group of children had more advanced conceptual understanding than arithmetical skill. ::: ::: ::: ::: Conclusions. The three subgroups may represent different points along a single developmental path or distinct developmental paths. The discovery of the existence of the three groups has important consequences for education. It demonstrates the importance of considering the pattern of individual children's conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Recent work has shown that this acceleration may be more likely to occur for the sharing of superficial self-information in initial general online interactions. This work was extended to explore the reported content of online disclosures in four different Internet arenas, social networking, instant messaging, general communication and online shopping. Using a self-disclosure scale amongst a sample of students to measure the revelation of information pertaining to individuals' beliefs, relationships, personal matters, interests and intimate feelings, the current findings showed that self-disclosure could be more categorical and goal-directed than can be accounted for by existing cue-impoverished and text-based explanations of online self-disclosure. Participants reported self- disclosing significantly less on online shopping sites than in the three communications type arenas. A consistent pattern of significant differences in the sharing of superficial (interests, relationships & personal matters) and more personal or intimate (intimate feelings & beliefs) information in instant messaging, social networking and general communication, along with an absence of significant intra-categorical disclosures is in line with hyperpersonal computer-mediated communication theory in that people selectively choose which information to self-disclose online, a proposal further supported by a significant decrease from relationship to personal matters information in instant messaging. These findings imply that categorical disclosures could be mapped onto the social cognitive self-memory-system model of autobiographical memory in line with the social penetration theory of self-disclosure. The findings along with non-significant differences in reported levels of overall self- disclosure across the Internet arenas are theoretically and empirically discussed, giving particular emphasis to considering future directions for research aiming to elucidate and explain the social cognitive processes associated with self-disclosure online.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We used different and complementary approaches: (i) a retrospective cohort study using a propensity score to adjust for confounding by treatment assignment and (ii) a matched case-control study. Of all patients with S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) in two university-affiliated hospitals over a 7-year period, 294 patients with MSSA-B were enrolled in the cohort study. The cases for the case-control study were defined as patients who received vancomycin treatment for MSSA-B; the controls, who were patients that received beta-lactam treatment for MSSA-B, were selected at a 1:2 (case:control) ratio according to the objective matching scoring system and the propensity score system. In the cohort study, SAB-related mortality in patients with vancomycin treatment (37%, 10/27) was significantly higher than that in those with beta-lactam treatment (18%, 47/267) (P = 0.02). In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that vancomycin treatment was associated with SAB-related mortality when independent predictors for SAB-related mortality and propensity score were considered (adjusted odds ratio of 3.3, 95% confidence interval of 1.2 to 9.5). In the case-control study using the objective matching scoring system and the propensity score system, SAB-related mortality in case patients was 37% (10/27) and in control patients 11% (6/54) (P < 0.01).

In the first study, the participants were either mimicked or not mimicked by the confederate. The second study focused on measuring the amount of mimicry engaged in by the participant. The research reported here demonstrates that (1) mimicry of others can be used to influence their willingness to purchase an unsought product and to increase the price they are willing to pay for it, and (2) the level of non-conscious mimicry by a consumer can be used to predict their willingness to purchase an unsought product.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Opinions range from the view that Catholics are predisposed to the Democratic Party to the position that they are classic centrists indistinguishable from other voters in the United States. Instead, we believe the measure of Catholic religious distinctiveness is its responsiveness to the social teachings of the Church. We evaluate the impacts of three issues included in Catholic social teaching regarding the consistent ethic of life ‐ abortion, the death penalty, and the preferential option for the poor ‐ on the political behavior of Catholics. Unlike other analyses that predict Catholic attitudes by individual-level characteristics, we are interested in knowing how issues important to the Church’s social teachings influence members’ political behavior. The positions of the Republican and Democratic parties on these issues pose conflicting pressures for Catholic voters. Herein lies the Catholic distinctiveness. Catholics use a mix of values, both secular and religious, to help them decide how to vote. The impact of these issues consistently pushes and pulls Catholics in the direction of the party position predicted by Catholic social teaching and is reinforced by age and regular mass attendance. We find that the contemporary Catholic vote is pluralistic but also sensitive to the expectations associated with fabric of life issues. Consistent advocacy of life issues by the Catholic Church has influenced the attitudes and political behavior of some Catholics.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Nonverbal communication may involve the use of blinkers, headlights, eye gaze, head and hand gestures. The present study examined an aspect of taxi drivers’ interpersonal communicative behaviour while driving , namely, use of gestures providing a sociolinguistic analysis of these gestures and taking into consideration the sociolinguistic factors and dimensions that determine their choice. The study was conducted on a random sample consisting of 100 male taxi drivers in Amman, the capital city of Jordan. During the first phase, informants were asked to fill in a questionnaire on the gestures they use while driving or during their breaks. The second phase involved interviews with ten informants. Finally, three informants were videotaped during their breaks. The drivers’ responses were then classified into groups according to age, education and experience in taxi driving. Interviews were then transcribed and analyzed in light of the questions of the study and the gestures used by the videotaped drivers were analyzed. The study revealed that age and education of taxi drivers affected the type and frequency of gestures used. Young drivers tended to gesture more while old drivers considered gesturing as an immature linguistic behavior. Old drivers with university education gestured less while drivers with limited school education gestured more. Further research is recommended on identifying the role gender plays in the use of gestures as well as other verbal and nonverbal communicative features of this slice of society DOI: 10.5901/mjss.2016.v7n3s1p312","[{""country"":[""Jordan""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, given the opposing nature of sustainability and suburbia, this task is not easy. Different approaches have tried to define the theory for achieving sustainable cities, but the nature of suburbia presents issues in densification, as density is perceived to limit the liveability and importantly the private sphere that makes suburbia desirable. To begin addressing sustainability in suburbia, the question of how to densify suburbs while maintaining their liveable quality, needs to be addressed. Focusing on the case of Canberra the paper builds a framework for discussing these questions within analysis of suburb density, behavioural studies and the public private interface. In doing so, it is evident that sustaining suburbia through densification, within the context of sustainable cities, cannot be considered without recognising morphology and the need for, and integration of, the public private interface.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This paper reports a mixed methods study examining the relevance, effectiveness and implementation of a professional learning program, as perceived by 68 Australian educators. Participants reported enhanced personal development and valued the course, but workplace demands and limited structured support were constraints on implementation. Methodological issues associated with research in authentic professional learning settings are discussed.

Canvassing the landscape of mandatory and voluntary public and private systems of formalities, this article argues that: (1) national policymakers retain more policy authority under Berne to impose certain formal requirements on rightsholders than those with a formalist understanding of public formalities argue; (2) private systems of formalities are extensive, economically significant, but are not interoperable with each other in many cases and with voluntary registries and other voluntary public formalities systems; and (3) policymakers should use a mix of approaches to improve the functioning of both public and private formalities systems by promoting or requiring transparency, efficiency, and interoperability in their design and administration.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The microbes that produce methane were examined in permanently cold, anoxic marine sediments at Hydrate Ridge (44 degrees 35' N, 125 degrees 10' W, depth 800 m). Sediment samples (15 to 35 cm deep) were collected from areas of active methane ebullition or areas where methane hydrates occurred. The samples were diluted into enrichment medium with formate, acetate or trimethylamine as catabolic substrate. After 2 years of incubation at 4 degrees C to 15 degrees C, enrichment cultures produced methane. PCR amplification and sequencing of the rRNA genes from the highest dilutions with growth suggested that each enrichment culture contained a single strain of methanogen. The level of sequence similarity (91 to 98%) to previously characterized prokaryotes suggested that these methanogens belonged to novel genera or species within the orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene libraries from DNA extracted directly from the sediment samples revealed phylotypes that were either distantly related to cultivated methanogens or possible anaerobic methane oxidizers related to the ANME-1 and ANME-2 groups of the Archaea. However, no methanogenic sequences were detected, suggesting that methanogens represented only a small proportion of the archaeal community.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The purpose of this study was to conduct a prospective, high-resolution examination of the relationship between nightly sleep and next-day functioning and psychotic symptoms in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Experience sampling methodology was integrated with actigraphy and sleep diaries across seven days in twenty-two patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Momentary assessments of mood, psychotic symptoms and functioning were gathered at five points each day following pseudo-random schedules. Multilevel modelling was performed to evaluate the links between variables. Both objective and subjective sleep disturbance predicted reduced next-day functioning, which remained significant after controlling for psychotic symptom severity. Increased sleep fragmentation and reduced subjective and objective sleep efficiency predicted greater next-day auditory hallucinations, whereas increased objective sleep fragmentation and reduced subjective sleep quality predicted greater paranoia and delusions of control. Negative affect on awakening mediated a proportion of these relationships (range: 17.9% - 57.3%). For the first time, we show that sleep disturbance is a predictor of next-day impaired functioning and psychotic symptom severity in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Interventions targeting sleep may therefore have the potential to enhance functional and symptomatic recovery in those experiencing psychosis, both directly and indirectly.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

While the statistical association between class and education in many countries has been relatively stable, measures of inequality applied to the same data show a marked reduc- tion of inequality in the distribution of higher education over time. This is a result of reduced bias in the allocation mechanisms, most likely facilitated by the increasing provision of higher education. Decreasing inequality means that the conclusion in the literature that egalitarian educational reforms have been ineffective lacks empirical support. One reason why measures of inequal- ity have been overlooked in most educational attainment research may be the fi rm but unfounded belief in the 'margin insensitivity' of loglinear measures. They are assumed to capture the association net of changes in the marginals of the class-by-education table, thus refl ecting the 'true nature' of the allocation mechanism in recruitment to higher education. This notion can be shown to be a logically untenable deduction from the property of loglinear measures of being insensitive in relation to one specifi c kind of change in the marginals, to the claim that these measures are insensitive to marginal changes in general.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

But we know very little about the impact engineering ethics education has on students' ethical values or attitudes and moreover, if diversity contributes to it. An empirical study is conducted to first, assess the relative impact of an ethics class in student's individual and inherent moral values, and second, to determine if demographic characteristics of the students as individuals and as a group contributes to this impact.

In those patients who had US-guided intra-articular steroid injection, the response to the injection was recorded by reviewing the 2-week pain diaries and clinical notes. Partial or complete pain relief was defined as a positive response and the same or increased level of pain as a negative response to the injection. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Fifty-nine (59/63, 93.6%) patients with midfoot joint degenerative changes received US-guided injection. The majority of patients had a positive response up to 3 months post-injection (78.4% still experiencing pain relief at 2 weeks, 57.5% at 3 months and fewer than 15% of patients further than 3 months post-injection). The number of positive therapeutic responses did not differ significantly between patients with diagnostic and non-diagnostic response (p = 0.2636). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: US-guided intra-articular injections for midfoot degenerative changes can have a good therapeutic result in the majority of patients up to 3 months post-injection.

It includes public transport modes (buses, railway, subway, and taxi) and private vehicles (cars and motorcycles). The costs considered include operating costs (fuel, lubricants, tires and operating personnel), indirect costs (insurance, taxes, vehicle depreciation, infrastructure, etc.), travel time (access, waiting, riding and transfer time) and externalities. The application of the models to Barcelona city yield a cost of 0.51 Euro/pax-km for public transport, whereas private vehicle costs are around 0.77 Euro/pax-km. Numerical elasticities for the unit cost to travel speed increases are -0.38 for public transport, while the same elasticity is -0.57 for speed reductions. A sensitivity analysis has been performed regarding the most relevant variables of the model, especially the value of time savings, concluding that the model is robust. Effects of unit transfers of trips from public transport to traffic and vice-versa are also analyzed. The mode is also consistent with shopping basket expense distribution surveys. In addition to its value as a means of learning about relative social benefit of transport modes, the model has also the mission of establishing common grounds for clarity in metropolitan transport data. The objective of this paper is to define future quality of life policies based upon the overall costs of transfer.","[{""country"":[""Spain""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Explicit incorporation of costs into such planning is considered in this article in the situation where effects of an intervention or treatment may depend on (interact with) baseline severity of the targeted symptom or disease. Because much larger sample sizes are usually required to establish such an interaction effect, investigators frequently conduct studies to establish a marginal effect of the intervention for individuals with a certain level of baseline severity.MethodsWe conduct a rigorous investigation on how to determine optimum baseline symptom or disease severity inclusion criteria so that the most cost-efficient design can be used. By using a regression model with an interaction term of treatment by symptom severity, power functions were derived for various levels of baseline symptom severity. Computer algorithms and mathematical optimization were used to determine the most cost-efficient research designs assuming either single- or dual-stage screening procedures.ResultsIn the scenarios we considered, impressive cost savings can be achieved by informed selection of baseline symptom severity via the inclusion criteria. Further cost-savings can be achieved if a two stage screening procedure is used and there are some known, relatively inexpensively collected, pre-screening information. The amount of total cost savings are shown to depend on the ratio of the screening and intervention costs. In our investigation, we assumed that: 1) the cost of approaching available subjects for screening is constant, and 2) all variables are normally distributed. There is a need to carry out further investigations with more relaxed assumptions (e.g., skewed data distribution).ConclusionsAs cost becomes a more and more prominent issue in modern clinical trials, cost-saving strategies will become more and more important. Strategies, such as the ones we propose here, can help to minimize costs while maximizing knowledge generation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Existing research has mostly relied on the localised knowledge spillover, or LKS, model to explain this. This model holds that knowledge transfer across distance is costly, and collaborating locally reduces the risk of information loss when the knowledge is transferred. However, there are various other reasons that could also explain the pattern. If the local university can make a useful contribution, firms might choose to look no further. Firms may also see collaboration as a long-term investment, helping to build up research quality at the local university with the hope of benefiting in the future. Finally, firms may want to contribute to the local community. We extend the LKS model with these additional motivations and explore their validity using data from 23 semi-structured interviews of firms that collaborate intensively with lower-tier local universities.","[{""country"":[""Norway""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, moderate alcohol intake is often thought to be healthy. Therefore, effects of chronic moderate alcohol intake on liver and intestine were studied using urinary vitamin levels. Furthermore, effects of Tinospora cordifolia water extract (TCE) (hepatoprotective) on vitamin excretion and intestinal absorption were also studied. ::: ::: Methods In the study, asymptomatic moderate alcoholics ( n = 12) without chronic liver disease and healthy volunteers ( n = 14) of mean age 39 ± 2.2 (mean ± SD) were selected and divided into three groups. TCE treatment was performed for 14 days. The blood and urine samples were collected on Day 0 and 14 after treatment with TCE and analyzed. ::: ::: Results In alcoholics samples, a significant increase in the levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, HDL and LDL ( P < 0.05) was observed but their level get downregulated after TCE intervention. Multivariate analysis of metabolites without missing values showed an increased excretion of 7-dehydrocholesterol, orotic acid, pyridoxine, lipoamide and niacin and TCE intervention depleted their levels ( P < 0.05). In contrast, excretion of biotin, xanthine, vitamin D2 and 2- O - p -coumaroyltartronic acid (CA, an internal marker of intestinal absorption) were observed to be decreased in alcoholic samples; however, TCE intervention restored the CA and biotin levels. Vitamin metabolism biomarkers, i.e. homocysteine and xanthurenic acid, were also normalized after TCE intervention. ::: ::: Conclusion Overall data depict that moderate alcohol intake is also hepatotoxic and decreases intestinal absorption. However, TCE treatment effectively increased the intestinal absorption and retaining power of liver that regulated alcohol-induced multivitamin deficiency.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

AIG: Case Study","Abstract Banks and other financial institutions have increasingly realized the necessity to measure and manage the credit risk of their loans. Credit derivatives CDs, therefore, have arisen in response to the surging demand of financial institutions to design vehicle tools for hedging and transferring credit risks. Credit Default Swaps CDS are valuable financial tools that have created system- wide benefits. However, at the same time these innovation contracts have likewise created the prospect for market participants to destabilize the whole economic system. Over the last years, international financial markets have suffered disastrous disruptions caused by various factors. The most important of these factors, in particular, is the detrimental impact of CDs as hedge funds on different markets of different sizes and structures. They have been blamed for part of the difficulties associated with the subprime credit crisis. As though, these credit risk transfer products require a basis for sound applications and uses. This study aims to elucidate on the problems associated with market participants in particular the large financial institutions that were eminently involved the recent financial crisis. Furthermore this paper presents a discussion of the blaming of hedge funds for financial crisis by focusing on the American International Group which blundering in the CDS market and causing system-wide instability, and argue the company's high efficient risk management and profuse diversity financial tools, which insure financial institutions, could prevent sorts of financial risks. As a result of AIG's exposure analysis in CDS positions, we find CDS were key contributor on igniting and exacerbation of current financial crisis.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

For single mothers, however, the phenomenon of the 'third shift' is becoming increasingly prevalent. With the advent of the 2006 welfare reforms, new workforce 'participation' and ongoing bureaucratic requirements take up an increasing amount of single mothers' time and effort. Moreover, the complex, overlapping and inconsistent requirements of Centrelink and the Child Support Agency (CSA) mean that what little money is earned by single mothers is often soon eroded. Income, the ages of children, shared care rates and child support fluctuations are all monitored and tested by the government, functioning effectively to keep many of these families' incomes on the poverty line. In this article I offer 'an introduction to accountancy' for single mothers, examining some of the accountability that is required of single mothers if they are to receive ever-diminishing income support payments. This 'third shift' is shown to add to the burden of labour borne by single mothers without necessarily providing the pathway out of poverty the reforms promise.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Particularly suitable candidates for such tests are the $0_{00} \to 2_{20}$ and $1_{01} \to 2_{21}$ channels, arising from the relaxation of the field-free selection rules due to the hybridization of $J$ states.

Caring for nature, the performance of volunteering activities, and social interactions were the main drivers of involvement. Over time, motivations were shaped by the interplay between individual expectations and experiences with the social and ecological context.

His initial experiment, subsequent market experiments, and models of price adjustment and exchange have added considerably to our knowledge of how markets reach equilibrium, and how they respond to disruptions. Perhaps the best known model of exchange in CDA market experiments is the random behavior in the “zero-intelligence” (ZI) model by Gode and Sunder [1993]. They conclude that even without trader rationality the CDA generates efficient allocations and “convergence of transaction prices to the proximity of the theoretical equilibrium price,” provided only that agents meet their budget constraints. We demonstrate that – by any reasonable measure – prices don’t converge in their simulations. Their budget constraint requires that a buyer’s currency never exceeds her value for the commodity, which is an unnatural restriction. Their conclusion that market efficiency results from the structure of the CDA independent of traders’ profit seeking behavior rests on their claim that the constraints that they impose are a part of the market institution, but this is not so. We show that they in effect impose individual rationality, which is an aspect of agents' behavior. Researchers on learning in markets have been misled by their interpretation of the ZI simulations, with deleterious effects on the debate on market adjustment processes.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Conditions often worsen in summer with diminished access to healthy foods and safe venues for physical activity. Objective A public–private partnership was formed to develop and evaluate an integrative health intervention entitled ""Mission Thrive Summer"" (MTS). Methods The MTS setting was an urban farm and adjacent school in a low-income community in Baltimore, Maryland. The intervention included farming, nutrition education, cooking, physical activity, yoga, mindfulness, and employment. Mixed-methods outcomes evaluation was conducted. Quantitative measures included accelerometry and self-reported health behaviors, using the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, Perceived Stress Scale, Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQA), CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, and Block Kids Food Screener (BKFS). Outcomes were compared pre- and post-intervention using paired t -tests. Qualitative evaluation was based on participant and parent interviews. Participants In total, 36 African-American 9th- and 10th-grade students joined MTS (17 in 2013, 26 in 2014, and 7 participating both years). Results In total, 88% of participants completed MTS. Accelerometry revealed that participants took 7158 steps and burned 544 calories per day during MTS. Participants experienced statistically significant improvements in self-reported physical activity (PAQA) and dietary habits (BKFS). Surveys did not detect changes in stress or mindfulness ( P > .05). Qualitative data demonstrated new knowledge and skills, increased self-efficacy, health behavior change, and program enjoyment. Conclusions MTS was feasible among African-American high school students in Baltimore. Mixed-methods outcomes evaluation provided preliminary evidence of health behavior change during the summer and at follow-up.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It finds that households’ portfolio composition has shifted considerably, due largely to falling asset values. Results also suggest that households are now entering a long period of debt reduction. The consequence of deleveraging is a reduction in household consumption; a process that cannot proceed without an increase in the household savings rate. In the wake of the economic slowdown, there is a risk that increased savings could be a drag on consumption and bank lending in the future, with negative implications for the speed of economic recovery.","[{""country"":[""Ireland""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

(1) The quantities found were large enough to enable commercial mining operations, (2) and in the 1960s, developments in technology meant that accessing these new mineral resources became a real and imminent possibility. (3) The problem, however, was that the deep seabed did not lie within the jurisdiction of any state. Consequently, to regulate access to these resources, a legal regime had to be established. The regime adopted was the 'common heritage of mankind'. The common heritage of mankind principle consists of four elements. It prohibits states from proclaiming sovereignty over any part of the deep seabed, and requires that states use it for peaceful purposes, sharing its management and the benefits of its exploitation. (4) Due to the ideological differences of developed and developing states, the common heritage of mankind principle has been interpreted in various ways. (5) These interpretations have not been reconciled and there has been no juridical consideration of the common heritage of mankind principle to clarify them. (6) Therefore, the precise legal requirements of the principle of the common heritage of mankind remain undefined. Although commercial deep seabed mining is unlikely to commence in the near future, there is still a need to establish an effective legal regime for the deep seabed. This need is demonstrated by, among other issues, the discovery of hydrothermal vents and the potential for military-based activities to occur on the deep seabed. Hydrothermal vent sites are located on the seabed in areas within and beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. (7) Each site consists of chemical rich waters that support a diverse range of micro-organisms and marine species. …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Export performance and alliance portfolio performance of SMEs: a managerial perspective","Why are some companies more successful in internationalization than others? Research in international business has tended to focus on macro-level factors, such as the “cultural distance” between home and host country. Micro-level factors, operating at the firm, or, individual-level, may well lead to differences in internationalization success. In this dissertation, I focus on one such factor: the “cultural intelligence” of the export manager. Individual managers play indeed a key role in major strategic decisions, especially within SMEs. I set out to explore a unique dataset of Italian SMEs to analyze how cultural intelligence, cultural distance, and export channels interactively influence export performance. I also investigate the role of the cultural intelligence of the managers in dealing with the cultural diversity of the firm’s export partners. Specifically, I analyze how cultural intelligence may help export managers manage cross-cultural relationships with the firm’s export partners, and turn cultural differences in superior alliance performance. My findings illustrates that cultural intelligence contributes to export performance and that this effect increases with cultural distance. This study’s results also suggest that the cultural intelligence of managers is needed mostly when the firm exports directly abroad and in culturally distant countries, rather than through foreign intermediaries. However, if the firm exports with the help of export partners, the higher the cultural distance between the home country and export countries and among the firm’s export partners, the more the firm needs managers with a high level of cultural intelligence to be successful. Finally, my findings highlight that measures of cultural intelligence that are specific to the situation (i.e. task-specific CQ and metacognitive CQ) matter more than general capabilities (i.e. general CQ) in explaining improvements in export performance and alliance portfolio performance. Together, the results of this research stress the importance of looking at individual-level variables, such as cultural intelligence, to explain the export activity of the firm and its outcome. Thus, they generally suggest that research in international business and alliance portfolio may benefit from bringing the individual manager back in.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Therefore, it is important to investigate how primitive functional proteins emerged from RNA world, which can shed light on the evolutionary pathway of life from RNA world to the modern world. In this work, we proposed that the emergence of most primitive functional proteins are assisted by the early primitive nucleotide cofactors, while only a minority are induced directly by RNAs based on the analysis of RNA-protein complexes.

This analysis is then contrasted with statements by two critics, Evan Narcisse and Justin Clark, about how Freedom Cry highlights specific marginalized identities and represents the past through the game form.

Hourly simulation of a microgrid in which wind and/or hydrogen are produced is used for the analysis. Results show that using underground seasonal storage leads to the government paying less incentive per kg of CO2 emission reduction as it lowers levelized cost of hydrogen and provides a higher carbon emission reduction potential. Results also show that for the same incentive policy, incentivizing hydrogen production with grid electricity or a blend of wind power and grid electricity and producing hydrogen using wind power with underground hydrogen storage are more cost-efficient options for government than incentivizing wind power production alone. Regarding the renewable energy incentives, a combination of capital grant and FIT is shown to be more cost-efficient incentive program for the government than FIT only programs. However, FIT programs are more effective for promoting renewable energy infrastructure.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Does Foreign Ownership Matter","More and more, the ability to innovate can be considered as an explanatory factor for determining the long term potential of firms to be competitive. Therefore, it is of increasing importance to understand the critical success factors behind notably radical product innovations. The present paper explores the yields and results in terms of a series of competitiveness indicators that domestic-owned and foreign-owned firms in the Basque Country obtain from technological collaboration practices. In particular, the study seeks to assess differences in the way these two groups of firms organize their technological partnerships (in terms of the geographical spread of partners with whom they cooperate and the purposes for which they deploy collaboration: for commercial or science/knowledge generation), and the comparative differences that stem from their respective practices. The study uses firm level data from the Euskadi Innovation Survey, for firms located in the Basque Country. The paper finds that ( a) technological collaborations comprising different types of partners have the greatest positive impact on innovation novelty, and (b) when looking at the ""nationality of ownership of firms"" (domestic or foreign companies), collaboration strategies developed by foreign-owned firms have higher impact on achieving novel innovation. We posit that the superior innovation performance we observe among foreign-owned firms -as opposed to domestic firms in the Basque Country- relies on their ability to benefit from both inter-regional partnerships and commercial-based networks for the sake of innovation","[{""country"":[""Spain""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We show here a scanning probe method combined with photoinduced current spectroscopy that allows mapping with nanoscale resolution of the generation and recombination lifetimes. Using this method we have analyzed the mechanism of the abnormal photovoltaic effect in multiferroic bismuth ferrite, BiFeO3. We found that generation and recombination lifetimes in BiFeO3 are large due to complex generation and recombination processes that involve shallow energy levels in the band gap. The domain walls do not play a major role in the photovoltaic mechanism.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Implicit in this situation is that ATP binds after closing the extracellular gate and thus predicts that ATP binding and extracellular cation binding to be mutually exclusive. We tested this hypothesis. Accordingly, we needed a cation that binds outside and not inside, and we determined that tetrapropylammonium (TPA) behaves as such. TPA competed with K(+) (and not Na(+)) for ATPase, TPA was unable to prevent phosphoenzyme (EP) formation even at low Na(+), and TPA decreased the rate of EP hydrolysis in a K(+)-competitive manner. Having established that TPA binding is a measurement of extracellular access, we next determined that TPA and inorganic phosphate (P(i)) were not mutually exclusive inhibitors of para-nitrophenylphosphatase (pNPPase) activity, implying that when P(i) is bound, the transport site has extracellular access. Surprisingly, we found that ATP and TPA also were not mutually exclusive inhibitors of pNPPase activity, implying that when the cation transport site has extracellular access, ATP can still bind. This is consistent with a model in which ATP speeds up the conformational changes that lead to intracellular or extracellular access, but that ATP binding is not, by itself, the trigger that causes opening of the cation site to the cytoplasm.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is hoped with the current Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) cashless policy there will be a drastic drop in such incidents. However, the issue of armed robbery attack at the bank premises brings to the fore two issues which are of paramount interest to the banker, customer and the general public. The issues are: (a) is the family of a bank customer killed by armed robbers in the banking hall during a transaction entitled to compensation? (b) Is a customer who is attacked by armed robbers in the banking hall and whose cash is snatched in the process of being lodged in; entitled to compensation from the bank? Therefore, the paper is aimed at examining banks’ liability in robbery incidents. The study adopts a theoretical approach and use of secondary data. The findings show that it is not in all cases that the customer will be compensated. It depends on the merit of the case and the stage the title in cash passes to the bank. Based on the findings it is recommended that banks’ should train their staff to be security conscious and how to behave in case of robbery attacks so as not to endanger their lives; and that of the customers. Key words : Liability, robbery, customer, security, cash and premises.","[{""country"":[""Nigeria""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The decline in the levels of participation of many of their Boomer and Post-Boomer parents is showing up in the decline of religious identification, involvement, and belief among young people. The findings point to the growing religious polarization of those who value faith and those who do not. Such a situation has emerged in large part because of the failure of three traditionally prominent players to relate well to teenagers: the United Church, Anglican Church, and Catholic Church in Quebec. Nevertheless, large numbers of young people remain open to greater religious involvement, supporting the argument of Rodney Stark and others that “there are some ongoing needs that only the gods can satisfy.” What remains to be seen is whether or not current and future religious suppliers will succeed in responding to the interests and needs that persist. Whether the current trend toward religious polarization continues, stops, or even reverses itself would seem to depend primarily on the performance of Canada’s religious groups – beginning with how they relate to young people.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This is especially important for mobile species, which can be exposed to threats across large areas, but the space use requirements of different species can vary to an extent that might render some management approaches inefficient. Here the space use patterns of seabirds were examined to provide guidance on whether conservation management approaches should be tailored for taxonomic groups with different movement characteristics. Seabird tracking data were synthesised from 5419 adult breeding individuals of 52 species in ten families that were collected in the Atlantic Ocean basin between 1998 and 2017. Two key aspects of spatial distribution were quantified, namely how far seabirds ranged from their colony, and to what extent individuals from the same colony used the same areas at sea. There was evidence for substantial differences in patterns of space-use among the ten studied seabird families, indicating that several alternative conservation management approaches are needed. Several species exhibited large foraging ranges and little aggregation at sea, indicating that area-based conservation solutions would have to be extremely large to adequately protect such species. The results highlight that short-ranging and aggregating species such as cormorants, auks, some penguins, and gulls would benefit from conservation approaches at relatively small spatial scales during their breeding season. However, improved regulation of fisheries, bycatch, pollution and other threats over large spatial scales will be needed for wide-ranging and dispersed species such as albatrosses, petrels, storm petrels and frigatebirds.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This frustration is revealed through the poem’s critical history, in which a variety of governing concepts are promoted. A focus on expected images that are not fully present but are suggested by its title reveals Herbert’s own vexed relationship with satire, specifically his indebtedness to the language of satiric affect suitable to the poem’s rebellious dimension—an indebtedness that finally cannot be fully articulated, as the poem itself demonstrates, within a devotional context.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy enhancing and toxicity reducing mechanism of combination of them in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats by metabolomics. Rats were randomly divided into seven groups, including A (healthy control), B (model control), C1 (therapy group), C2 (efficacy enhancing group), D1 (toxicity group), and D2 (toxicity reducing group), and dexamethasone group was used as positive control. The plasma biochemical indexes showed that therapeutic dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could significantly inhibit the concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in AIA rats, and combination with total glucosides of peony could further reduce the concentration of IL-1β. Then, UPLC-LTQ/Orbitrap MS with untargeted metabolomics was performed to identify the possible metabolites and pathways. Through multivariate data analysis of therapeutic dose groups (A vs. B vs. C1 vs. C2) and multivariate data analysis of toxic dose groups (A vs. B vs. D1 vs. D2), 10 and 7 biomarkers were identified based on biomarker analysis, respectively. After inducing AIA model, the plasma contents of spermidine, vanillylmandelic acid, catechol, and linoleate were increased significantly, and the contents of citric acid, L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, leucine, L-tryptophan, and uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) were decreased significantly. High dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could increase the plasma contents of L-lysine, L-arginine, and deoxycholic acid, while the plasma contents of UMP, carnitine, N-formylanthranilic acid, and adenosine were decreased significantly. The pathway analysis indicated that therapeutic dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could regulate energy and amino acid metabolic disorders in AIA rats. However, toxic dose could cause bile acid, fat, amino acid, and energy metabolic disorders. And combination with total glucosides of peony could enhance the therapeutic effects and attenuate the toxicity induced by lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Congress authorized each of these wars. The president has also initiated several limited wars. These limited wars have not been explicitly approved by Congress as required by Article I of the Constitution. A review of the history of making limited wars suggests several conclusions. First, the president has assumed a de facto power to begin and pursue a limited war, understood as a struggle where no American combat deaths are expected. Second, Congress has at times been highly critical of such wars but also highly deferential to the president in cases where the wars were brief and popular. Third, an active and critical Congress can shape the president's choices and decisions about such wars. Fourth, the public is often skeptical about limited wars and strongly supports congressional approval of such undertakings. Finally, until recently, presumed presidential authority under the Constitution was more important than the approval of international institutions in legitimating limited wars. In Libya the approval of the United Nations Security Council and other international institutions was essential to legitimating the war according the Obama administration. This incremental transfer of the war powers to international institutions contravenes the republican nature of the United States Constitution.","[{""country"":[""Libya""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The Trento project also must face the challenge of whether it can realize its stated intention to reject any ideological point of departure, since that would require it to adopt Schlesinger's principles without incorporating his preference for identifying similarity over difference. Moreover, differing contexts are relevant to analyzing the utility of any given comparative approach. The same approach can have defects in the context of United States comparative law that may not affect European comparative law; it can have defects where the comparative undertaking is to form legal norms for the European Union that may not be an impediment where the goal of the comparative undertaking is to heighten intellectual understanding for scholarly purposes. The Trento project's objective of revealing the core characteristics of private law in the EU's Member States is not unrealistic. While the differences that separate the common- and civil-law mentalities and cultures are irreducible and incommensurable, they nevertheless are not beyond the understanding of participants of both legal systems. These differences reflect the two great intellectual discourses of all of the Member States' societies, corresponding to the fundamental characteristics of the Enlightenment and Romanticism, movements that have been integral to all of the EU Member States. The modern challenge facing comparative law is that, just as a new generation of comparatists has unearthed differences often ignored in the past, the categories of relevance to the future may still be indistinct and in a formative stage, requiring comparatists to remain detectives of new future relevances as national, linguistic and geographical attributes are changing in valence in a rapidly altering world.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Is focus—or unfocus—a strategic choice, best practice or perhaps a reflection of an environmental constraint? In his pioneering work, Skinner [W. Skinner, 1974. The focused factory. Harvard Business Review 52 (3), 113–121] prescribes companies to ensure that the manufacturing task of their manufacturing units is simple and focused, for instance, by assigning a narrow product mix for each factory or concentrating on a narrow mix of production technologies. Especially in the absence of compelling empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the focused factory approach, we argue that we still do not understand why some plants may remain unfocused. We observe that in the international process industry case examined in this paper, some factories are unfocused and their manufacturing tasks are all but simple. Yet, some of them appear to be high performers. This presents an opportunity to seek empirical insight on the questions raised above. Specifically, we examine why manufacturing companies in the process industries may or may not follow the focused factory strategy. Our results suggest that in certain operating environments and with certain competitive strategies, choosing not to focus the manufacturing task should be viewed as a viable alternative manufacturing strategy, perhaps even a constraint imposed by the operating environment. We develop four contingency propositions to explain why focused manufacturing strategy may not be desirable or even possible.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We argue that essentialist representations among these women mask the role of power between various social intersections of gender. The various modes and contingencies of essentialist idealized representations may be interpreted as psychological strategies employed by Asian immigrant women to locate displaced identity within a transnational and postcolonical history.

The role specific histone residues have in this process has been shown to be an important mechanism of transcription regulation. Previously, we identified eight amino acids in histones H3 and H4 that are required for nucleosome occupancy over highly transcribed regions of the genome.ResultsWe investigate the mechanism through which three of these previously identified histone H3 amino acids regulate nucleosome architecture. We find that histone H3 K122, Q120, and R49 are required for Spt2, Spt6, and Spt16 occupancies at genomic locations where transcription rates are high, but not over regions of low transcription rates. Furthermore, substitution at one residue, K122, located on the dyad axis of the nucleosome, results in improper reassembly and disassembly of nucleosomes, likely accounting for the transcription rate-dependent regulation by these mutant histones.ConclusionsThese data show that when specific amino acids of histone proteins are substituted, Spt2, Spt6, and Spt16 occupancies are reduced and nucleosome dynamics are altered. Therefore, these data support a mechanism for histone chaperone binding where these factors interact with histone proteins to promote their activities during transcription.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The study was premised on a framework of professional development that views teacher education as a continuum that includes training, recruiting, retaining, and retraining. The article argues that in Uganda more research has been focused on the first two levels of the continuum, with evidence on the last one remaining less documented. Data was largely collected from qualitative semi-structured interviews with selected policy makers, school administrators, and teachers. The interviews were complemented with an analysis of relevant documents and a workshop with the participating teachers. A thematic analysis of the data revealed three categories of existing Continuing Professional Development programmes in Uganda including those initiated by government agencies and donors; those initiated by schools; and those initiated by individual teachers. The article highlights the need for a critical examination of these existing programmes with a view to ensuring that they reinforce each other. Introduction and Background A number of policy changes in Uganda in recent years have impacted on lower secondary education provision. The success in terms of access to Universal Primary Education that was introduced in 1997 was followed by an enormous demand for secondary education. To address this demand, the government introduced the Universal Post-Primary Education and Training (UPPET) policy in 2007. Under this policy, government covers a wide range of expenses for students enrolling in government-aided schools, and bursaries to those eligible (those scoring 4-28 aggregates) in selected private secondary schools in sub-counties without government-aided secondary schools. This policy has far-reaching implications on secondary schools and teachers such as having to cope with large classes and having to deal with learners from multiple abilities and socio149CICE Hiroshima University, Journal of International Cooperation in Education, Vol.15 No.3 (2013) pp.149~ 168 Connie Ssebbunga-Masembe, Ronald Bisaso, Charles Kyasanku, Rose Costa Nakawuki and Mary Goretti Nakabugo 150economic backgrounds, among others. Preceding the UPPET policy was the science policy which was introduced in 2005. This made all science subjects (biology, chemistry, and physics in addition to mathematics) compulsory at Ordinary (lower secondary) Level (O-Level). This policy was introduced to an already struggling science education sector. Performance in the science subjects as reflected by results of national examinations administered by the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) at O-Level has been unsatisfactory for the past 3-4 decades. The Ministry of Education and Sports (MoE&S) refers to a study conducted by UNEB in 2004 which shows a consistent high failure rate in science and mathematics. The study shows that for five consecutive years (2000-2004), more than 40% of secondary school students failed science and mathematics (MoE&S, 2007a, p.3-4). For example, while 45.1% of the candidates failed mathematics in 2003, only 1.5% achieved Distinction in mathematics. This trend of failure persists to-date. In the recent 2009 O-Level results, science subjects were noted to have continued to register high failure rates with over 50% of the candidates unable to pass with the minimum grade 8 (Daily Monitor Reporter, 2010). This state of affairs raises the need to explore the quality enhancement measures that are in place to train and equip secondary school teachers, more so the science teachers, with effective pedagogy and school administrators with the skills to create enabling environments for effective learning. Training and Development of Secondary School Teachers in Uganda: An Overview According to the official statistics accessible from the MoE&S, there were 50,767 secondary school teachers in total in 2007 (MoE&S, 2007b). Of these 39,520 were male and 11,247 female teachers. The data is not segregated according to the particular level of secondary education i.e. either lower secondary (Ordinary Level) or upper secondary (Advanced level). The minimum qualification for teaching at O-Level is Advanced Level (A-Level) with a diploma in education obtained from a National Teachers’ College (NTC). Teaching at A-Level requires A-Level and bachelor’s degree or B.A/BSc with a postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE) qualifications, although in situations of scarcity of graduate teachers, diploma holders tend to teach a specific subject across Oand A-Level. Table 1 below, highlights the level of qualification of secondary school teachers in Uganda. All teachers in category 1-5 (34246 teachers in total) (67%) possess the required qualifications for teaching at secondary school level. The table shows that the majority of teachers (17,520) possess a diploma in education qualification, followed by those in possession of a degree in education (13,735).

First, the bone marrow actively recruits circulating tumor cells where they find a sanctuary rich in growth factors and cytokines that promote their proliferation and survival. When in the bone marrow, tumor cells profoundly affect the homeostasis of the bone and the balance between osteogenesis and osteolysis. As a consequence, growth and survival factors normally sequestered into the bone matrix are released, further fueling cancer progression. Second, tumor cells actively recruit bone marrow-derived precursor cells into their own microenvironment. When in the tumors, these bone marrow-derived cells contribute to an inflammatory reaction and to the formation of the tumor vasculature. Third, bone marrow-derived cells can home in distant organs, where they form niches that attract circulating tumor cells. Our understanding of the contribution of the bone marrow microenvironment to cancer progression has therefore dramatically improved over the last few years. The importance of this new knowledge cannot be underestimated considering that the vast majority of cancer treatments such as cytotoxic and myeloablative chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation and radiation therapy inflict a trauma to the bone marrow microenvironment. How such trauma affects the influence that the bone marrow microenvironment exerts on cancer is still poorly understood. In this article, the reciprocal relationship between the bone marrow microenvironment and tumor cells is reviewed, and its potential impact on cancer therapy is discussed.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

To this end, 179 essays written by high school graduates in five Estonian schools are analyzed.1 It is argued that the conceptualisation of adulthood is contextual and young people position and conceptualise themselves in the framework of these changes. Youth in Estonia, like their peers in Western Countries, stress intangible features (such as responsibility, mental maturity, social maturity, freedom) along with measurable transitions (employment, marriage, parenthood) when conceptualising adulthood. However, the meanings behind the concepts differ and are valued differently among respondents. This paper aims to provide a glance into what meanings are given to these perceptions. The most prevalent themes picked up by respondents were institutional transitions, responsibility and social maturity. Such prevalence is plausible, since these features in the transition to adulthood have changed the most in recent decades: the institutional context has changed and measurable transitions have prolonged; the level of individual responsibility in transitions has grown and the society has transformed.","[{""country"":[""Estonia""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We employ the difference-in-difference (DID) and difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) models to a unique dataset on water polluting activities in Songliao Basin counties from 2003 to 2009. Empirical results show that on one hand, regulation and water pollution are negatively correlated, the stricter the regulation is, the less water pollution happens. On the other hand, as no explicit accountability and synergetic governance system were set up by the 11th Five-Year Plan, prefecture-level municipal governments tend to exert the least enforcement efforts in the most downstream counties. We find the evidence of strategic water polluting that the overall output value, new entry into and old business water polluting industries are significantly higher in the most downstream county of a prefecture-level city, relative to other similar counties.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A transdisciplinary approach is a key component of sustainability science. However, there are considerable barriers to implementing transdisciplinary projects. We undertake a mixed quantitative and qualitative analysis of peer-reviewed sustainability science studies where the transdisciplinary approach has been applied. We assess the growth and scientific impact of transdisciplinary sustainability research, the methods used and how three key characteristics of transdisciplinarity research—process phases, knowledge types and the intensity of involvement of practitioners—are implemented. While transdisciplinary research is growing there is no common glossary, no focused communication platform and no commonly shared research framework. Transdisciplinary research utilizes a broad, but not clearly defined, set of methods for knowledge production. While the intensity of practitioner involvement varied within the case studies analyzed, very few realized empowerment. Based on our review of transdisciplinary case study papers we conclude that transdisciplinary research must be clearly framed, including the use of a common terminology and the development of a broad suite of appropriate methods. Despite the challenges highlighted here, science needs to move beyond classical disciplinary approaches and should consider interdisciplinary work that engages with practitioners to achieve sustainable transitions.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

We modeled the decisions of producers aiming to maximize their expected income while subject to a number of constraints and phytosanitary risks. We also examined the impacts of different protection strategies targeting downy mildew, the main grape disease in European Atlantic vineyards. The Vineyard model for Environmental Policy Analysis (VINEPA) model is a multi-periodic stochastic programming model based on panel data of about one hundred representative winegrowing farms from the Farm Accountancy Data Network in the Bordeaux region. The response of vines to fungicide treatments against downy mildew was simulated through the downy mildew potential system, an epidemiologic model initially developed for decision support, using data from multiple weather stations along with special plots of untreated vines, monitored weekly over a 10-year period. The VINEPA model accurately reproduced the current chemical protection strategies in the region. Simulations were then carried out for different types of taxes (ad valorem and volume based) at different rates. In addition, we analysed the effects of policies on spraying practices, along with their potential impact on investment in precision technology equipment.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Based on a thematic analysis of the studies, including coding and categorization strategies, eight approaches were identified: collaboration, metacognition, blending, modeling, authentic learning, student-active learning, assessment, and bridging theory/practice gap. The approaches consider ways that teacher education programs promote student teachers’ digital competence, and educate them in professionally using ICT for their future use in school and classroom teaching in secondary education.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In each of the yearly panel waves computer-aided telephone interviews (CATI) are conducted with about 6,000 start-up firms from almost all industries. The KfW/ZEW Start-up Panel will for the first time enable profound analyses of the temporal development of newly founded firms, including studies of firm survival.

Underlying the discussion is an assumption that indicators are a technology, a product, which governs behaviour, is modified by users (outside of the producer community), and develops in response to user needs. Science and technology indicators are considered separately from innovation indicators, and the importance of language based on codified and tacit knowledge is emphasized. The knowledge is codified in manuals, and the tacit knowledge is held in overlapping communities of practice that develop the manuals, gather the data, produce the indicators and use them. Finally, there is a discussion of how this process changes and renews itself.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Consistently, they anticipated idiosyncratic sets of future prices and elected probability laws on these sets, that we called beliefs. Under mild conditions and differently from Hart [1975] and Radner [1979] equilibrium always existed in this model, as long as agents' anticipations precluded arbitrage. The joint determination of equilibrium prices and beliefs is traditionally seen as a rational expectation problem. Hereafter, we suggest it may be otherwise. We propose to show that agents, whose prior anticipation sets yield an arbitrage, may update their expectations from observing trade opportunities on financial markets. With no price to be observed, they eventually infer smaller arbitrage-free anticipation sets, which can not be narrowed down any further. Once these sets are attained, equilibrium prices may change if agents change their beliefs, but they will convey the same information.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This is done by examining the role of violence in State formation in west central Zambia from the 17th century onwards. The chapter shows that State formation in west central Zambia entailed the imposition upon local village communities of a more or less centralized sociopolitical structure, representing a departure from the social organization and ideology prevailing in pre-State times. In the specific context of the expansion of Lunda political culture over much of south central Africa, the typical form of Statehood that emerged had two salient features: perpetual kinship and positional succession, neither of which corresponded with structural themes in local village society. The chapter compares the cultural logic of the village and that of the royal court in more detail, arguing that the latter completely ignored the former. This is illustrated by the particular cases of the Nkoya and the Lozi. Notes, ref. [ASC Leiden abstract]","[{""country"":[""Zambia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The backdrop for Norelus’s story comes out of Ariela J. Gross’s new book What Blood Won’t Tell: A History of Race on Trial in America. In What Blood Won’t Tell, Gross, an elegant historian and eloquent storyteller, enlarges an already distinguished body of work on slavery, race, and antebellum trials to investigate the changing meaning of identity in law and litigation. Bridging the study of law and culture, she constructs or rather reconstructs identity - both race and gender - from the artifacts of local knowledge expressed in social performance and scientific expertise. Gross points to two “key moments” in the twentieth century American history of racial and gender identity occurring initially when “racial identity trials shifted from more routine adjudications of ancestry to intense contests about science and performance,” and subsequently when jingoist and nativist movements ignited “efforts to define the boundaries of citizenship racially.” During these moments, she notes, the forum for the “determination” of racial identity moved to the local courthouse, “a key arena through-out the nineteenth century for struggles over identity.” At local courthouses, Gross explains, trials of racial and gender identity “reverberated through American culture.” Indeed, for Gross and others, the “cultural arena” of a courthouse and the “legal case” at stake “could fix the identity of an individual or an entire national group with a conclusiveness that was hard to overturn.” Because of its cultural import, Gross argues, “law has been a crucial institution in the process of creating racial meaning at every level.” Both trials and trial transcripts, she observes, disclose “glimpses of ordinary people’s, as well as lower-level legal actors’ understandings of legal and racial categories and of their own places in the racial hierarchy.” Race trials, Gross emphasizes, “brought to the surface conflicting understandings of identity latent in culture, and brought into confrontation everyday ways of understanding race with definitions that fit into the official, well-articulated racial ideology that supported the maintenance of slavery and post war racial hierarchy.” Witnesses, lawyers, and litigants entangled in this cultural conflict “learned to tell stories that resonated with juries” and judges; in doing so, they actively participated in “the day-to-day creation of race.” This Essay extends Gross’s historical scrutiny of identity trials to contemporary civil rights debates over the construction of race in law and litigation. The Essay is divided into three parts. Part II maps Gross’s analysis of racial identity trials, explicating her notions of racialized common sense and performance. Part III examines the trial and appellate litigation in Floride Norelus’s civil rights case. Part IV considers alternative approaches to civil rights litigation embodied in identity performance and empowerment strategies.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The main idea is that the state denoted by an adjectival secondary predicate can already be evoked by an event denoted by a verb from the preceding context – similar to bridging cases in the nominal domain. For example, the event cry can evoke the state sad just as the event drive can evoke the referent driver. It will be shown that the intermediate information status of secondary predicates can have a perceivable linguistic reflex, namely in the felicitous and infelicitous use of (Spanish) secondary predicates in adversatives. In addition, two ways will be discussed in which the intermediate information status can come about (activation and construal), and it will be shown that both ways apply to nominal and non-nominal constituents alike.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This is known as rent control. Because some price equilibria may be disqualified given such restrictions, this paper proposes an alternative equilibrium concept, called rationing price equilibrium, tailored to capture the specific features of housing markets with rent control. An allocation rule that always selects a rationing price equilibrium is defined, and it is demonstrated to be ``efficient"" and (group) non-manipulable for ``almost all"" preference profiles. In its bounding cases, the rule reduces to a number of well-known mechanisms from the matching literature. In this sense, the housing market with rent control investigated in this paper integrates several of the predominant matching models into a more general framework.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

CESifo Working Papers-5592, 2015) to evaluate the counterfactual welfare effect of SAFTA and AFTA on member countries as well as on the non-member countries. After accounting for potential endogeneity of RTAs, removal of AFTA causes 3.08% real GDP loss for member countries, removal of SAFTA causes 6.36% real GDP loss for member countries, and joint agreement of SAFTA and AFTA brings 0.71 real GDP gains for member countries.

It also explores the cointegrating behavior of the MENA stock markets with the United States equity markets. Granger causality tests based on the VECM reveal strong bidirectional causalities between several of the MENA stock markets. The Granger causalities also indicate that stock market returns of Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Malta, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia exhibit cointegrating behavior.The results reveal significant weak exogeneity from the United States stock markets to all the MENA stock markets. The findings suggest that while MENA stock markets tend to co-move with the U.S. stock market. Furthermore, markets within the MENA region are not yet fully integrated with the U.S. However, market imperfections may preclude U.S. investors from entering MENA markets to take advantage of possible diversification benefits. The increased level of integration of markets within the MENA region does not necessarily reduce the potential of risk diversification for international portfolios.(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)IntroductionOver the last two decades, the Middle East and North Africa stock markets (MENA) have been regarded as one of the most promising investment opportunities in the world. This emerging market area provides significant portfolio diversification opportunities for investors. Financial liberalization has been implemented in a majority of MENA countries through structural adjustment programs and large-scale privatization. These programs helped to promote significant expansion of opportunities for worldwide investors. In addition, a large number of MENA nations adopted macroeconomic stabilization policies that are designed to ensure economic stability, low inflation, and reduced budget deficits. These policies help to attract and retain global investors. The confluence of liberalization reforms, oil revenue increases, excess liquidity, and petrodollar spillovers to adjoining countries has significantly increased market capitalizations, turnovers, IPOs and returns (Hammoudeh and Alesia, 2004). The region reflects growing stock market price movement interdependence. For example, the 2006 Dubai stock market collapse affected prices in varying degrees in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Egypt (Hammoudeh and Alesia, 2004). Evidence of market integration within the MENA region would have practical importance to those who wish to invest in the region. If the markets within the MENA region tend to move together, an investor would be able to achieve his or her desired risk/return relationship by investing in any of the markets within the region.The financial integration of the world's major stock markets has been extensively studied in the empirical financial economics literature (see for example, Kaminsky and Schmukler, 2002; Bekaert and Harvey, 2000 and Kim and Singal, 2000). Emerging markets have been emphasized in the literature because they present new opportunities for portfolio and money managers to maximize the return of their portfolios. Bekaert and Harvey (1997) find that stock market returns in emerging markets were high and predictable, but lacked strong correlation with U.S. or European markets. As emerging markets mature and integrate with the world markets, they become more sensitive to the volatility of stock markets elsewhere. Emerging market integration with world markets will decrease their ability to enhance and diversify international portfolios (Neaime, 2002).Previous research focusing on the integration of stock markets in MENA nations with those in the rest of the world is limited. Neaime (2002) using the Engle-Granger (1987) cointegration approach, test for the integration of MENA markets with world stock markets over the period 1990 to 2000. He finds a weak integration among the MENA markets (Morocco, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey) and strong integration between MENA markets and developed markets (U. …","[{""country"":[""Middle East & North Africa""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Its focus is on the social context in which the religious congregations did and do their work. In the fi rst half of the 19th century, a very large number of active religious congregations of brothers and sisters were founded throughout Europe. 1 The foundation of these active religious congregations constituted a reaction to the perceived secularization of European society, after the Enlightenment period of the 18th century. Many of the religious congregations were (very) successful in the late 19th and early 20th century. They were able to attract many members and play an important role in the fi eld of Catholic education—as well as in other social fi elds, notably Catholic health care. In the second half of the 20th century, most of the active congregations in Europe experienced a rapid decline. Large numbers of brothers and sisters left their congregations; the congregations were and are also hardly able to attract new members. It is now clear that this particular form of religious devotion, which for the most part took shape in the 19th century, will not be continued in Europe in the 21st century. The major contemporary challenge that faces the religious congregations is to hand over their works of charity to lay people—that is, to “real” lay people (as, from the point of view of canon law, sisters and brothers are also lay people because they are not ordained). This chapter starts with a discussion of the characteristics of secularization in Europe. It is argued that secularization cannot simply be interpreted in terms of religious decline. Modern society provides for a different context. This context","[{""country"":[""Belgium""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The special attention is dedicated to the level of NPL loans and their ratio compare to total loans. The quality of credit portfolio is important determinant in future bank strategies, thereby it’s important for the economic development of the whole country. The NPL loans affect the economic development through the credit activity which influence on the consumption and the capital adequacy ratio which constrain the possibility of growth. Thus creating a spiral and higher NPL ratio create low economic growth and low growth creates further NPL portfolio. In this paper analysis will be focused to compare the data of quality of credit portfolio in Macedonia, Serbia and Croatia. The comparative analysis will outline the differences in the quality of the portfolios in sample countries as well as the reasons for the differences. The reasons for higher resilience of some banking systems portfolios compared to others can be used as a valuable tool for enhancing the stability of the banking systems. These three countries are chosen because they had high credit growth in the past until the financial crises, they were affected by the crisis in the same time and their banking systems are dominantly owned by foreign banks.","[{""country"":[""Croatia"",""Serbia""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Based on a survey of around 600 biogas plant operators, the fractions of excess heat from the cogeneration units in these plants are analysed. A heuristic is developed to match biogas plants (heat sources) with local settlements (heat sinks) in order to determine a least-cost district heating supply for residential buildings. Two criteria are employed, namely the CO2 abatement costs and the payback period, which represent the macro- and microeconomic perspectives respectively. Based on the survey, the mean fraction of excess heat is 40%, which is in agreement with other empirical studies. Extrapolating this fraction to the German biogas plant stock, which is selected as a case study, leads to technically feasible CO2 savings of around 2.5 MtCO2/a. Employing the criteria of CO2 abatement costs and payback period yields about 2 MtCO2/a below CO2 abatement costs of 200 €/tCO2 and below a payback period of 9 years. This represents about 0.25% of the total German CO2 emissions in 2016 or around 2.5% of all CO2 in residential buildings. Alternative threshold values of 80 €/tCO2 and 5 years payback period reduce the carbon reduction potential to about 0.5 MtCO2 and 0.75 MtCO2 respectively. These relatively high average costs are related to the typically low population density in rural regions where biogas plants are located. These potentials are concentrated in around 3,500 of 11,400 municipalities, where district heating from biogas plants could reduce CO2 emissions per capita by an average of 250 kgCO 2 / a and cover 12% of the total heating demand. Apart from a methodology that can be transferred to any country with comparable data availability, the present study demonstrates that the use of excess heat in biogas plants can contribute to global decarbonisation.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This also comes at a time when the UK is seeking to renegotiate its relationship with the EU, and as the likelihood of Turkey joining the EU as a full member is increasingly remote. In light of these challenges, Andrew Duff MEP proposes a new type of associate membership, where countries would agree to the EU’s values, but not to all its activities or political objectives. This, he argues, would give some countries a springboard towards membership, and others, an alternative to it. To do nothing instead, he writes, would pose risks that any future treaty changes would be blocked by one or other member state.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

DESIGN Series of cross sectional surveys, the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions (ULF) and the British General Household Survey (GHS), during the period 1992–95. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Swedish and British men and women aged 25—64 years. Approximately 4000 Swedes and 12 500 Britons are interviewed each year in the cross sectional studies used. The sample contains 15 766 people in the Swedish dataset and 49 604 people in the British dataset. MAIN RESULTS The magnitude of social inequalities in less than good self rated health was similar in Sweden and in Britain, but adjusting for income differences explained a greater part of these in Britain than in Sweden. In Britain the distribution across income quintiles explained 47% of the social inequalities in self rated health among women and 31% among men, while in Sweden it explained, for women 13% and for men 20%. Poverty explained 22% for British women and 8% for British men of the social inequalities in self rated health, while in Sweden poverty explained much less (men 2.5% and women 0%). CONCLUSIONS The magnitude of social inequalities in self rated health was similar in Sweden and in Britain. However, the distribution of income across occupational social classes explains a larger part of these inequalities in Britain than in Sweden. One reason for this may be the differential exposure to low income and poverty in the two countries.","[{""country"":[""Sweden"",""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This paper explores the advantages and challenges of introducing competitive bidding among MA plans (Plan One) or among MA plans and Fee-for-Service (Plan Two or Premium Support). We conclude that competitive bidding could reduce the cost of Medicare, especially in densely populated urban areas. However, there would be serious challenges in rural areas and risk adjustment methodology would have to be substantially improved. In Plan Two, sicker beneficiaries might move to Fee-for-Service and beneficiaries might have to pay more to stay with a preferred provider or broader network. If these problems are addressed, we believe that premium support can be a meaningful improvement to the MA program.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It reviews previous studies on multilateral liberalization, focusing on the findings from computable general equilibrium (CGE) models with relevance to African economies. The implications of these findings for poverty reduction are discussed. Our own CGE exercise supports the hypothesis that African countries cannot expect substantial gains from further multilateral liberalization. Moreover, given the sharp contraction of import-competing sectors in response to trade liberalization in many African economies, coupled with insufficient compensation through labour market adjustments in other sectors, this study suggests that the ultimate impact on poverty reduction is likely to be small or even negative.","[{""country"":[""Africa Eastern and Southern""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

These pragmatic measures included allocating government resources for vitally important public goods and services at federal, state, and local levels. Though Niebuhr was initially drawn to some form of democratic socialism, he embraced this incremental strategy within the context of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s implementation of his New Deal agenda.

It classifies US counties into 25 portfolios based on unemployment level and the change in nominal income. The results, using serious delinquency on revolving credit as default risk, show that the intercepts are indistinguishable from zero in 22 portfolios, and the average default rate of a portfolio increases with its beta. The additional risk factors based on unemployment and income growth portfolios marginally improve the single-factor model. The results are robust to time-varying betas and personal bankruptcy as a measure of consumer lending risk.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We then describe the role of statistical models of networks for testing these hypotheses, including the problem of operationalizing theoretical concepts with the parameters of statistical models. Examples from existing policy research are provided and potential extensions are discussed. This paper is forthcoming as the introduction to a special issue of the Policy Studies Journal on statistical models of policy networks. Paper Prepared for Political Networks Conference, 2011. Ann Arbor Note to PolNet 2011 Readers: Believe with Caution! This paper is in midstream so there are many missing references and sections that need additional work. We would welcome any comments that would help clarify the ideas in the paper, and especially persuade readers about the value of applying statistical models of networks to policy theory. Also, the references to the PSJ special issue might be confusing so feel free to ignore.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The data were obtained from 6,124 students nested within 172 schools. A two-level hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) was utilized in the analysis using HLM. The explanatory variables in level 1 included students’ educational aspiration, self confidence in science, value in learning science, the amount of homework, parent involvement, the possession of a computer, and the number of books at home. The exploratory variables at level 2 included school size, resource for teaching science, computer availability, and school discipline and safety. This indicated that 37 % of the total variance of science achievement is accounted for by school-level and 63% by student-level differences. At level 1, the variables could explain within school variance by 21% with the psychological variables accounting for a greater part of the variation than other variables. The differences in student performance across schools were explained by school size by 13%. This study suggested policies and strategic plans for policy makers, educational administrators, school principals and teachers to improve the quality of science education in Thailand.

They are typically organized as closed-end funds aiming to overcome informational asymmetries and to exploit specialization gains in selecting and overseeing portfolio firms. However, their existence as financial intermediaries creates new informational asymmetries (with respect to the investors in the PE funds). Fund managers raise follow-on funds before exiting their investments, and may have incentives to overvalue their as-yet-unsold investments when making disclosures to institutional investors. Despite strong incentives to overvalue, PE funds do not face mandatory disclosure rules in any country with a significant PE industry. Yet the overvaluation of unexited PE investments has the potential to distort capital allocations to the PE industry generally, and across PE funds in different countries around the world. Disclosure of performance to the investor is burdened by two main difficulties. On the one hand, valuation requires sufficient information on the performance of the firm whereas on the other hand, even if sufficient information is available, PE firms may disclose information strategically. The main aim of this Article is to discuss these two issues in detail.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The survey based research methodology was used in this study. The researcher used a scale distributed to four dimensions: Management of the football federation, the product, distribution, and promotion. Study sample consisted of (165) male and female students representing the four academic years in the University. The results showed that there was a high level of relevance and suitability of the proposed plan for marketing the Jordanian football league. No statistically significant differences between subgroups in the sample (Academic year & gender) were found. The researcher had recommended the authorities to provide all the incentives that helped in attracting the internal and external capital for investing in the Jordanian football industry, as well as the possibility to issue relevant sport legislations for the present stage. In addition, it was recommended to establish the needed policies that obliged the private and public sectors to support the football federation plans according to a marketing plan.","[{""country"":[""Jordan""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This article explores the reasons traditionally given for the need for lower federal courts and whether, in practice, the federal courts are actually serving those needs. For example, it has been assumed that state courts are less hospitable to federal civil rights and consumer claims than federal courts, yet in many jurisdictions, plaintiffs’ lawyers prefer filing claims in state courts under state anti-discrimination or consumer laws rather than federal laws to prevent removal of the case to federal court. The article encourages third-year law students to take this capstone course because of its unique blend of the highly theoretical with the very practical questions facing any lawyer in deciding whether to file in - or remove to - federal court.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Attention to this context, absent from media accounts, is essential to understanding the plight of Afghan women in all its complexity. Second, we examine news frameworks and the ways in which Afghan women figure in imperialist agendas in a thoroughly Orientalist manner.

This is built upon the recent advancement in the scholarship on urban competitiveness that demonstrates a clear deviation from an economic-centric approach to incorporate multiple dimensions of a city’s progress. This study has an explicit concern for environmental sustainability and its relationship with urban competitiveness and their conceptual and methodological articulations. Empirically, this study measures the sustainability and competitiveness in Australian cities and reveals that Australia’s urban progress is clearly associated with an environmental cost. The findings are useful to inform policy making and planning for building sustainable and competitive cities. Apart from the conventional solutions that focus on urban form change and transport infrastructure improvement, this study suggests a need to explore the opportunities deriving from the emerging smart city planning and practice.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

It x-rays the human rights approach to combating environmental degradation which was successfully adopted for the first time in Nigeria in Gbemre v. Shell. It recommends that machinery should be put in motion for the case whose outcome (though on appeal) constitutes a major breakthrough for the human rights approach in Nigeria to be finally decided. The paper also explores the origin and meaning of the term ecocide touching on the status of the crime of ecocide in international law and particularly in Nigeria.

The quantum mechanics is one of two backbones of the modern physics, and it is the most important required major course in the physics specialty. It is deeply applied not only in many branches of physics, but also quickly and extensively in many important domains such as chemistry, biology, material science, and information science. By the studying of this course, students could masterly grasp the basic concepts and theories of the quantum mechanics, and have the basic theories of quantum mechanics to analyze the solve problems. The course of ""quantum mechanics"" of the department of physics of Dezhou University was appraised as the Shandong Provincial provincial-level quality course, and by virtue of this chance, the teaching content and method of quantum mechanics are reformed, and primary results have been obtained. 1. Main ideas of the teaching reform In the traditional teaching, teacher is authority and students must accept the knowledge taught by the teacher without any condition. In the new term, this traditional concept should be changed, because the traditional concept would gradually cultivate students' dependence on teacher to be habits accordingly. Students dare not doubt their teachers, not to speak of the authority, so students' individuality and creation would be killed. To cultivate the innovational talents and implement new teaching concepts, and advocate the people-oriented concept, both students' principal function and teacher's domain function should be exerted, and the quality education should be carried out. Some reforms in the teaching content, teaching method, and teaching measure in quantum mechanics could really enhance the quality of talent cultivation. 2. Reform of teaching contents Teaching content is the most basic factor in the teaching activity, and it would directly influence the teaching effect. When explaining the basic concepts and the basic computation method, the mathematical knowledge would be used inevitably, and students are not required to grasp complex mathematical deduction process, so the physical contents should not be submerged in the complex mathematical form. Proper teaching method could make students not only to grasp the application of mathematics in the course, but avoid complex mathematics, and centralize their energies to understand the physical concepts of the quantum mechanics, and grasp the basic concepts of the quantum mechanics. For example, for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and hydrogen atom, only the idea, method, and conclusions should be mainly introduced, and the detailed deduction is not necessary. Students should be instructed to study the classic literatures, which could not only enhance students' level of foreign language, and cultivate their ability to primarily read professional literatures, but also let students to listen on the masters' voice, study the masters' thinking and expression mode, and enhance their studying interests. In the instruction of basic theories, the ""interface"" between the teaching content and the frontier development of physics should be set up to make students to know the development trend of physics and expand their views. At the same time, the special lectures about the frontier knowledge of physics should be added (Zhao, 2001, P.78 & Lei, 2005, P.39 & Fan, 2005, P.47). Some special lectures about the quantum mechanism such as the quantum information theory, the application of quantum mechanics in the nanotechnology, and the application of quantum mechanics in the biological technology should be developed to expand student's knowledge.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Specifically, advancements in video capturing and social media have made public events into spectacles that are observed and shared online by the public. Public protest and discourse loosens itself from the bounds of state authority and enters the arena of the public. This phenomenon reconsiders Foucault’s conception of the panopticon. Foucault’s panopticon is useful as a tool for understanding the way power operates through surveillance in a state-to-public direction, but technological advancements have allowed for a reversal of this surveillance. With real examples like the pepper spraying of student protesters at UC Davis, the public now has surveillance over the state (in this example police officers) from its multitude of citizen perspectives that can be shared and disseminated online. This is an important development because it increases the autonomy and safe power of individuals who wish to speak out against excessive use of power by the state over the public. People can do so without fear of greater police suppression of real events. Issues with this development are discussed, like the chance for the state, or other sites of power (like corporations) to develop the copyrighting of public pace, making any event the property of power structures. This would be a problem, as it would lessen the autonomy of individuals in public","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We found an average decline of 4.4 percent in the prevalence of poverty due to SNAP benefits, while the average decline in the depth and severity of poverty was 10.3 and 13.2 percent, respectively. SNAP benefits had a particularly strong effect on child poverty, reducing its depth by an average of 15.5 percent and its severity by an average of 21.3 percent from 2000 to 2009.

The model is tested with various parameter settings in Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses yield the following key results: first, in the short term, all the support measures improve systemic stability. Second, in the longer run, there are settings which mitigate the systemic crisis and settings which contribute to systemic breakdown. Finally, there are differences among the effects of the different types of support measures. While bailouts and recapitalization are the most efficient types of support type and execution of guarantees is still a viable solution, the results of liqu idity measures such as asset relief or provision of funding liquidity are significantly worse.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Religion, identity, place and conflict on the Sydney north shore","ABSTRACT Religious identity, when marked by physical changes to urban landscapes, has been a cause of tension and conflict in many cities. In the Sydney suburb of St Ives, an attempt to create an eruv, a symbolic and only partly physical boundary around orthodox Jewish space, was vigorously opposed and eventually defeated through the planning system. The religious and physical significance of the eruv resulted in diverse rationales of opposition, centred on the physical and environmental impact, the conceptual nature of boundaries and the role of religion and ‘modernity’ in everyday suburban life. The place of an eruv was opposed with reference to spatial imaginaries of the nation, the suburb and the secular public, as religion and worship intersected with the politics of urban citizenship and belonging. Each of these spatial imaginaries was constructed by opponents in such a way as to deny a place for an eruv in St Ives, and reinforced through the application of planning instruments which eventually refused permission for an eruv. To many residents, public space was seen to be at risk, raising complex questions over amenity, the politics and perception of difference and what is in or out of place.

Using analytical expressions for revenue elasticities at the individual and aggregate levels, together with a simulated income distribution, values for New Zealand were obtained. Results using equi-proportional income changes suggest that the aggregate income and consumption tax revenue elasticities are both fairly constant as mean income increases, at around 1.3 and 0.95 respectively. This latter estimate assumes that increases in disposable income are accompanied by approximately proportional increases in total expenditure. If there is a tendency for the savings proportion to increase as disposable income increases, a somewhat lower total consumption tax revenue elasticity, of around 0.9, is obtained for 2001 income levels. However, non-equiproportional income changes are more realistic. Allowing for regression towards the geometric mean income reduces these elasticities, giving an elasticity for income and consumption taxes combined that is only slightly above unity. Examination of the tax-share weighted expenditure elasticities for various goods also revealed that, despite the adoption of a broad based GST at a uniform rate in New Zealand, the persistence of various excises has an important effect on the overall consumption tax revenue elasticity, especially for individuals at relatively low income levels.","[{""country"":[""New Zealand""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This study examines bidding patterns in a series of first-price sealed-bid experimental money auctions (where the commodity being auctioned is money itself). We hypothesize that biddersâ€™ behavior is affected by the framing of the potential monetary payoff into ``monetary prizeâ€ and ``winnerâ€™s bonusâ€ components.

The military secrets of the Arctic Ocean are being progressively uncloaked, as civilian polar research expands into areas previously known only to a few. This study examines the security ramifications of broadened international research into what has been the most inhospitable and exclusive operational area on Earth. Firstly, the study argues that successful military operations in the Arctic depend on extended knowledge about area-specific issues related to e.g. the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere, weather, sea ice, ocean structure and dynamics, seafloor bathymetry and sediments, as well as reliable target detection systems. Secondly, it finds that a number of nations, both Arctic and non-Arctic, have stepped up their polar research in recent years. Secrets once held by a few are now accessible to many through international cooperation, data-sharing and open-access publishing. Finally, the study concludes that knowledge proliferation is likely to level the Arctic battlefield. Lending terms from Mica Endsley’s three-level Situation Awareness model, polar research will result in increasingly shared perceptions about the Arctic operational environment, contribute to a more uniform comprehension of the elements, and even enable new actors to project a future state of the Arctic environment.","[{""country"":[""Norway""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

These roots are threefold: first, the relative academic freedom of the period together with the scholastic theological method of doubting, secondly, the rise of constitutional government and the dualism of the Church and the State in medieval society and thirdly, the theological speculation on the freedom of conscience all eventually contributed to the idea that everyone has the right to live his or her relationship with God in a freedom that is constitutionally and judicially protected against any form of coercion.

Specifically, Centros rejected the argument that, under the real seat doctrine, the country in which the corporation’s head office is located may deny recognition or apply domestic corporate law to a corporation that is validly formed in another EU state. At the time, commentators broadly viewed Centros as opening the door to greater regulatory competition in Europe. Twenty years later, we examine Centros through the lens of SB 826—the California statute mandating a minimum number of women on boards. SB 826, like Centros, raises questions about the extent to which a forum state, as opposed to the state of incorporation, can impose its laws on corporations that operate within its borders. In the US, these questions are typically addressed by application of the internal affairs doctrine which provides that the law of the state of incorporation applies to the corporation’s internal affairs. Both SB 826 and Centros thus highlight the critical importance of the scope of the internal affairs doctrine. In this article, we stress the importance of the shareholder primacy norm to understanding the scope of US corporate law, which results in corporate law focusing primarily on matters of shareholder economic interest. We argue that the internal affairs doctrine should be understood within the context of the shareholder primacy norm and therefore directed to rules oriented to enhancing firm economic value. Considered in this context, SB 826 is distinctive in that it focuses on broader societal interests than traditional corporate law. In the same vein, EU corporate law has traditionally had a broader stakeholder orientation. We posit that the limited impact of the Centros decision, an impact which differed significantly from its predicted revolutionary effect, can be attributed to the greater focus of EU corporate law on social ordering and a more limited adherence to the shareholder primacy norm. Ironically, California’s adoption of SB 826 may portend a movement of the US towards Centros-style governance.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We establish the conditions under which higher skill dispersion leads to specialization in industries characterized by higher skill substitutability across tasks. The main results are robust when the model is extended to allow for partial observability of skills. Finally, we use distributions of literacy scores from the International Adult Literacy Survey to approximate cross-country productivity differences due to skill dispersion and we carry out a quantitative assessment of the impact of skill dispersion on the pattern of trade.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this context, I examine the life and thought of M.K. Gandhi, particularly the way he addressed the nature of India and its problems as British imperial rule ended. It also focuses on Gandhi’s critique of Hindu tradition as a powerful buttress of profound social inequality particularly relating to caste and gender; his response to violence in the name of religion and community; and finally his underlying belief that true religion was the individual’s search for the divine and that all religious traditions by contrast have very partial visions of truth.

These factors largely offset the impact of option compensation, which strongly encourages earnings management.

Firstly, the meaning of minority discount for reduced powers will be investigated as well as its economic determinants, specifically pointing out that the economic rationale behind this type of minority discount lies in the impossibility for the minority purchaser to gain the prerogatives associated to a controlling position. Then the analysis will focus on the considered examination of the evaluation criteria of minority interests in businesses non-listed on official markets developed by main doctrine, at the same time singling out the salient and peculiar features thereof together with some comments and in-depth studies on the subject-matter. In this respect the main features of both direct and indirect valuation criteria will be analysed, specifically focusing on the second ones which measure the economic value of such minority interests by executing a discount percentage to the pro-rata value of the whole company’s economic capital (W). Finally the methods most often utilised by the European well-qualified professional praxis to measure the value of minority interests non-listed on regulated markets will be investigated. To this purpose, a number of official reports concerning purchase/sale transactions of minority interests in European non-listed companies will be examined. Finally, some conclusions on the topic at stake will be drawn.","[{""country"":[""Euro area""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Despite this perception, clubs are continuing to experience growth both in terms of membership and revenues collected and many play significant roles within the communities in which they operate. With regard to special events, much of the economic and social impact work published to date has focused upon the impact of such events in terms of accommodation and restaurant use, as well as visitor numbers and economic multipliers. The club industry in Australia, and in New South Wales (NSW) in particular, is a vibrant and thriving industry, but little work has been carried out to quantify the impact upon clubs of “outside” or external special events. Using in-depth interviews and discussions with marketing staff within two clubs in NSW (one rural and one metropolitan), this article examines their relationships to hallmark events that were conducted within each club's region. Analysis is made of the clubs' involvement with these events and the extent to which they were aggressively proactive in acquiring linkages to the event in question.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The average gasoline price in the United States peaked at $4.05 per gallon in the second week of July, and it remained fairly high most of the third quarter of 2008, dropped significantly through September to December in 2008, and began to rise again in January 2009 (Energy Information Administration, 2009). A survey conducted during June 9–12, 2008 while gasoline prices were rising significantly, shows that 11% of Americans were limiting or cutting back on their travel or vacations due to the rising gasoline prices (Newport, 2009). As the survey results suggest, the effect of rising gasoline prices on consumers’ leisure travel patterns is assumed to be negative due to decreased wealth and disposable income and increased cost (or price) of their travel given a downward sloping demand curve for recreation, if recreation is a normal good. Nonetheless a quantitative estimate of the impact of gasoline prices on leisure travel patterns has not been explicitly explored (Englin, et al., 2003, Heberling and Templeton, 2009, Hesseln, et al., 2003, Martinez-Espineira and Amoako-Tuffour, 2008). The lack of research on the impact of gasoline price on leisure travel patterns may be due to relatively stable gasoline prices during the 80’s and 90’s. The impact of gasoline price on leisure travel patterns has become an important issue because consumer sensitivity to fluctuations in gasoline prices affects travel decisions (Walsh, et al., 2004) and spikes in gas prices can be nontrivial. The travel cost model is often used to measure the benefits provided by access to public recreation sites, e.g., national parks and national forests, which have relatively minor, if any, entrance fees (Oh, et al., 2005). Hotelling (1947) is credited with the initial development of the travel cost model. Using the travel cost model, observed travelers’ net economic benefit, or consumer’s surplus, from visiting a recreation site is calculated as the value of access to the","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

But we are also on the verge of misinterpreting why they are living where they are. It is clear that the rush to the suburbs that began in earnest half a century ago continues apace. Now it is the far flung suburbs that are growing most rapidly, as more and more rural areas are becoming suburbanized. Many large cities have also increased their population somewhat, while others have not, and those that are growing have done so mainly as a consequence of immigration from abroad. What do these developments mean? For some, as a Harvard economist recently told the New York Times, ""What all this says is that consumer preferences are important,"" (1) On this view, immigrants move to cities and long-time residents leave them for the far-out suburbs because that is where they have chosen to live. Central cities that want to grow must therefore find a way to sell themselves better to those now moving outside the beltways. They should start by trying to remake themselves in the image of the suburbs that seem to be so popular with today's metropolitan residents. For example, the Harvard economist suggested that to be attractive places to live, cities ""need to make streets safe and schools solid."" (2) No doubt, he would add, to keep themselves attractive, suburbs should be sure to continue doing the same thing. This way of thinking about the census results is a mistake. It is just as likely that the new census data reflect not consumer preferences but the fact that we have done too little in the last half century to give citizens a meaningful set of choices about where and how to live. That is because we have done virtually nothing to change the legal rules that have promoted unceasing sprawl since the end of the Second World War. These rules establish the framework within which individual choices are made, but they are not natural or inevitable. Even those that were chosen by citizens (rather than by the courts) were often chosen decades ago--so long ago, in fact, that we now take them for granted. If one reads the census results with these legal rules in mind--and if one also keeps in mind that these legal rules can be changed--it will become clear that the picture that some census-readers divine of a well functioning market in which consumer-voters choose where to live misses much of what is really going on. This is not to deny that some people are choosing some suburbs because they want lower taxes, less crime, and better schools. But those staying behind in central cities and declining suburbs are not doing so because they want higher taxes, more crime, and worse schools. They want the things that the prosperous suburbs have too, but they cannot have them. Why not? The answer is that current legal rules allow some places to have good schools and low crime while paying less in taxes than the places that have bad schools and high crime. These rules include those that allow local governments to engage in exclusionary zoning, that base school financing on local wealth, and that give incentives for economic development to occur farther and farther away from poor people who need the jobs it creates. These rules allow the rich to exclude the poor from their jurisdiction and then to spend the money raised from local taxes on schools that admit only local residents and on crime control techniques that protect these residents from outsiders. In other words, they allow some people to gain privileges by isolating themselves from those across the city line who want the same privileges. One way to see how local government law enables this to happen is to read the population figures for the multitude of cities that now constitute American metropolitan areas. In Los Angeles County, for example, the city population varies from 91 (Vernon) to 3,694,820 (Los Angeles); in the St. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The research extends the model of cost, management and agency factors associated with voluntary audit, and develops a complementary model for voluntary full accounts. The results show the benefits of placing full audited accounts on public record that outweigh the costs for a significant proportion of companies. In non-micro small companies, voluntary audit is determined by cost and agency factors, whereas in micro-companies it is driven by cost, management and agency factors. In both groups, the predictors of voluntary full accounts include management and agency factors, and choosing voluntary audit is one of the key factors. The study provides models that can be tested in other jurisdictions to provide evidence of the needs of micro-companies, and the discussion of the methodological challenges for small company researchers in the UK makes further contribution to the literature.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Coeducation gradually entered the American educational landscape in the late 1800s (Bureau of Education, 1883; Butler, 1910; Kolesnik, 1969), and since that time, single-sex education mainly has been confined to private and denominational (mostly Catholic) schools. According to Tyack and Hansot (1990) and Hawtrey (1896), economic factors were the major impetus for the rising ""tide of coeducation."" Simply put, it was cheaper to educate boys and girls together than to operate separate schools, which would have required duplicating expensive facilities, equipment, and personnel. Feminists of the day also valued coeducation as a necessary step in the women's rights movement and their influence contributed to the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, aimed at guaranteeing gender equity in federally financed schools, colleges, and universities. Finally, coeducation was considered ""natural"" in that it facilitated the development of positive relations with members of the opposite sex, allowed boys and girls the opportunity to learn to work together, and was conducive to happier marriages (Atherton, 1972; Hale, 1929). In the second half of the 19th century, William Harris, superintendent of the St. Louis schools and later U.S. Commissioner of Education, argued that mixing the sexes improved instruction and discipline for boys and girls by merging their different abilities and allowing students of each gender to serve as a ""countercheck"" on the other (Harris, 1870). As we have seen with most educational reforms and innovations, the fanfare that welcomed coeducation very soon led to concerns and indictments. In his book, Sex in Education, Clarke (1873) purported that academic competition with boys overloaded girls' brains and interfered with the development of their reproductive organs. Single-sex education (also less frequently called single gender and SS) garnered renewed interest in the 1990s from researchers, advocacy groups, and policymakers; and since 2003, there has been an extraordinary surge in interest in single-sex public education. The new regulations, issued by the U.S. Department of Education on October 25, 2006, fueled the fire of this renewed interest. Secretary Spellings, commenting on the ""final rule,"" noted that Research shows that some students may learn better in single-sex education environments. The Department of Education is committed to giving communities more choice as to how they go about offering varied learning environments to their students. These final regulations permit communities to establish single-sex schools and classes as another means of meeting the needs of students. (U.S. Department of Education, 2006) Assessing the relative advantages and disadvantages of single-sex classes and schools is difficult. As singlesex education gains interest and appeal, educators, policymakers, and advocates continue to search for research evidence to legitimize this approach to improving student outcomes (e.g., academic, behavioral, social, attendance, self-esteem). While this review of the research will not be limited solely to middle grades schools, many of the studies that are reviewed were conducted in middle grades schools. Considerable exploration of single-sex education has occurred in the realm of legal and political issues, but there has been comparatively litde examination of student outcomes and other educational implications. Salomone (2006), recognizing the problematic and inconclusive nature of this research literature, noted that most of the research originates from private and denominational schools and from abroad and tends to be anecdotal reports and scattered studies that lack scientific rigor. This installment of What Research Says will focus on what we currently know about single-sex education.

One of such mechanisms that has been given prominence is the alternative dispute resolution mechanism. This research was therefore set out to add its voice to this advocacy by investigating the effectiveness of the alternative dispute resolution in Ghana using the Alavanyo-Nkonya peace mediation as a reference point. The aim of the research was to ascertain reasons for the use of alternative disputes resolution in this protracted conflict case and also examine the strengths and weaknesses of the method. The research relied on interviews as a data collection instrument. In all, eight (8) interviews were conducted among members of the various committees as well as members and leaders from the two communities. The research revealed that the method of alternative disputes resolution was preferred by the people of the two communities compared to traditional method of litigation owing to the delays and judgemental posture of these traditional methods. Again, the research revealed that the use of alternative dispute resolution operated under a three pronged structure; the mediation committee, the consultative committee and the community pacesetters. All these structures worked under different remits to culminate in the desired result of peace for the two communities. The research equally revealed a large involvement of the people from the two communities in the peace process. The research therefore recommends that there should be more vigorous education on the relevance of alternative disputes resolution in Ghana as well as a creation of alternative dispute resolution units in all district and regional capitals.","[{""country"":[""Ghana""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The paper provides a review of current estimates of trade potential in the region and contrasts this with the author's own estimates of intra-regional trade. A gravity model is used. The model examines how the reduction of trade transaction costs, the level of development and the size of an economy influences trade potential amongst countries. A major finding is that fundamental structural and economic factors such as the transaction costs of trading, the growth paths of economies and changes in per capita income should be the focus of regional integration rather than trade policy in its own right. The empirical results show that intra-regional trade in SADC is not low by international standards. When compared to regions such as the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) or Mercosur, actual South African exports are higher than estimated potential exports. However, the model indicates low trade volumes for combinations of countries in the SADC region. In particular, there is increasing scope for non-SACU countries to increase their exports to South Africa. These arguments have to be seen in the context of the impending Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in the SADC region. There is no question about the fact that an FTA will enhance the prospects for increasing intra-regional trade. However, it is important not to exaggerate the impact of a regional agreement. In other words, there is no substitute for national economic policies that are conducive to growth.","[{""country"":[""South Africa""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is very difficult to have a common understanding of the conditions that surrounded the disintegration of the former world order as well as of the processes, horizons and results of the transition to a new global order. This article discusses what exactly is in store for Russia and when a growing global disorder caused by the collapse of international institutions created after 2nd World War, the preservation of American domination, or something else. It was the United States that started revising the world order; therefore, Russia’s behavior can be considered revisionist only in relation to Washington’s revisionist strategy imposed on it. The current post-Washington world transition is analyzed here in the context of theoretical studies concerning the previous post-Vienna, post-Paris, post-Versailles and post-Yalta transitions and their historical experience. The article concludes that the current post-Washington transition is irreversible, yet it may take more time than the previous ones and extend beyond 2050. Each country should have to rethink its place and strategy of struggle for survival and development in the new transitional world. Russia is still working to define its national strategy, and the success will depend on a combination of asymmetric resistance aimed at upholding the country’s vital interests in the world, active efforts to build a new world order, and domestic reforms required for that.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

During the five-day conference from 26th to 30th October 1998, more than 200 papers were presented in a total of 20 sessions. In addition, preand post-conferences were held in Aomori and Sapporo, respectively. The conference was a great success with a large number of participants and presented papers. The remaining task for us in the organizing committee is publication, i.e., how to circulate the outcome of this successful conference to a broader academic world. We think it better that the NME and the Center for African Area Studies (CAAS), Kyoto University, share the work of publication, since the two institutions have collaborated since the initial stage of preparation for the conference. The CAAS has an English (and in part French) journal, African Study Monographs (ASM ), dedicated to publishing works on Africa. We therefore agreed with the NME members of the organizing committee that the CAAS will publish the papers mainly on Africa in a supplementary issue of ASM, possibly including a few other papers which may give us a general view of hunting and gathering societies. The papers included in this volume were originally presented in different sessions of the conference, mixed with the papers on similar topics from other areas. The collection of such papers in one volume will, therefore, present a myriad of theoretical interests and comparative perspectives. We have tried, however, to classify the papers into several groups to be reflected in the organization of this volume, which is comprised of the sections of History, Culture, Ecology, Contemporary Problems, and Prospects.

International emissions trading can help to reduce the overall cost of mitigation and ensure that companies in different countries face the same carbon price. Lower costs and tackling competitiveness concerns can enable higher levels of climate ambition. The Paris Agreement explicitly provides for international emissions trading, but the rules governing trading still need to be determined. In the absence of strict rules, international emissions trading might become a loophole leading to reduced climate ambition. And because of its consensus requirements, the United Nations process is unlikely to lead to comprehensive rules. To fill this gap, the European Union should engage with other nations to determine a set of rules that can serve as a gold standard for emissions trading anywhere in the world. Policy challenge The effort to define rules for international emissions trading faces the strong desire of nation states to develop their own climate policies, which collides with the need for tradable units in one country to be equivalent to tradable units in another country. To overcome this dilemma we propose a club of carbon-buying countries that would regulate only imported mitigation outcomes. We propose that private parties would be able, if permitted by the participating governments, to transfer any type of privately tradable emissions reduction unit across borders. But they would also be liable if the foreign units do not represent sufficient mitigation in the selling county. To bridge the period before final settlement, private parties would be able to borrow domestic compliance units, based on collateralising a certain amount of foreign units.","[{""country"":[""France""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Part public theater, part smoke-filled backroom, the Council has enjoyed notable successes and suffered ignominious failures, but it has always provided a space for the five great powers to sit down together. Five to Rule Them All tells the inside story of this remarkable diplomatic creation. Drawing on extensive research, including dozens of interviews with serving and former ambassadors on the Council, the book chronicles political battles and personality clashes as it opens the closed doors of its meeting room. What emerges here is a revealing portrait of the most powerful diplomatic body in the world. When the five permanent members are united, David Bosco points out, the Council can wage war, impose blockades, redraw borders, unseat governments, and levy sanctions. There are almost no limits to its authority. Yet the Council exists in a world of realpolitik. Its members are, above all, powerful states with their own diverging interests. Time and again, the Council's performance has dashed the hope that its members would somehow work together to establish a more peaceful world. But if these lofty hopes have been unfulfilled, the Council has still served an invaluable purpose: to prevent conflict between the Great Powers. In this role, the Council has been an unheralded success. As Bosco reminds us, massacres in the Balkans and chaos in Iraq are human tragedies, but conflicts between the world's great powers in the nuclear age would be catastrophic. In this lively, fast-moving, and often humorous narrative, Bosco illuminates the role of the Security Council in the postwar world, making a compelling case for the enduring importance of the five who rule them all.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The focus of scholars and policymakers has accordingly shifted from the defense and promotion of privatization to the design and improvement of corporate governance practices in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). A broad consensus has emerged suggesting that state-owned firms should be corporatized, publicly traded and subject to the greatest extent possible to the same legal regime applicable to private firms. However, by focusing exclusively on what corporate and securities laws can do to increase the efficiency of state enterprise, this view ignores the other side of the problem: How does the presence of SOEs affect the efficiency of corporate and securities laws as they apply to private firms? Brazil’s long historical experience with SOEs suggests that state ownership of listed firms can have unintended consequences that go beyond the potential firm mismanagement if the state pursues political goals inconsistent with shareholder wealth maximization. The state’s financial interest as the controlling shareholder of listed firms can lead it to disfavor legal reforms that improve minority shareholder rights, thus impairing the ability of private firms to raise outside financing. In ignoring the conflicts of interest inherent in the state’s dual role as shareholder and regulator, the conventional wisdom has likely overestimated the aggregate benefits of a unitary corporate law regime for both state-owned and private firms.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Through an investigation of the organizational capacity and ideology of terrorist groups that committed maritime attacks between 1998 and 2005, we argue that this kind of violent behavior is driven by capability. Certain organizational characteristics of terrorist groups—territorial control, involvement in the drug trade, organizational size, and connections with other groups—provide groups with the capabilities that make maritime attacks both realistic and desirable.

The survey contains questions on the wage-setting process, the existence of downward rigidity and the reasons for it, the reaction of firms to shocks, and the frequency and timing of wage and price adjustments. The survey reveals that almost all firms in Belgium are covered by a sector agreement, and just over a quarter apply an additional collective wage agreement at the firm level. Such firm-level collective agreements are more common in large firms. The results also show that just over half of firms apply a wage indexation mechanism with a threshold index, while just under half operate in an environment where indexation takes place at fixed intervals. The latter system is more common in large firms, so that the weighted results indicate that this mechanism applies to the majority of employees. The level of wages of new employees depends mainly on what is specified in collective agreements and on the wage level of comparable employees in the firm. However, the wages which the firm actually pays to its staff may deviate from the pay scales specified in the sectoral agreements. In a significant number of firms, especially for white-collar workers and skilled staff, actual wages paid exceed the sectoral pay scales. Such a wage cushion, forming a buffer between the actual wages and the collectively agreed lower limits, is more common in large firms. Overall, firms seldom respond to adverse shocks by cutting basic wages or using alternative ways of reducing labour costs per employee. Certainly in large firms, costs are reduced mainly via the employment channel, i.e. by reducing the number of primarily permanent staff, and to a lesser extent temporary workers. Reductions in non-wage costs are also important, while variable pay components are only cut in a small number of cases. Only a quarter of firms state that they adjust their prices more than once a year. Time-dependent price adjustments, in which the time of the adjustment does not depend on economic conditions (as opposed to state-dependent adjustments), occur in 22 p.c. of firms and are noticeably common in the business service sector. Combined with the low frequency of price adjustments, this indicates price rigidity in that sector. The frequency and timing of wage adjustments are closely linked to the indexation mechanism applied. Most firms adjust their wages no more than once a year. Time-dependent wage adjustments in a specific month apply to 61 p.c. of firms, and – like price adjustments – wage adjustments are concentrated in the month of January. Another peak occurs in July, and there is some concentration at the beginning of the second and fourth quarters, particularly in the case of wage adjustments.","[{""country"":[""Belgium""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Faced with vocal constituencies who want to divert the corporation from its commercial objectives, the corporation can choose one of two strategies: to play the reputation measurement game, or not. The danger in playing the game is to be ensnared by new regulation. In its 2002 questionnaire to Australia’s top 100 corporations, the Australian Conservation Foundation asked for assurance that, ‘the company’s environmental performance is beyond the minimal standards set by environmental legislation and other forms of regulation’. 1 The ACF and other NGOs who participated in the same exercise would prefer a far more extensive level of corporate regulation across the entire spectrum of corporate activity than is currently expressed in Australian law. In the debate about the proper relationship between corporations and society, often coined ‘corporate social responsibility’, NGOs are non-state or civil society regulators. 2 This Backgrounder reviews the Fairfax-published Good Reputation Index, and argues that the Index should be construed in terms of a competition between the state as the regulator of ‘acceptable’ corporate behaviour, and advocacy NGOs and the media as regulators of ‘good’ corporate behaviour. It concludes that corporations who played the game were rewarded with a good label, those who refused were labelled as bad. The Index is poorly administered, lacks objectivity and confuses reputation with performance. The Index is a tool in a campaign against the corporation and its freedom to promote its commercial objectives, consistent with the rule of law and the objectives of its owners and other significant contracted parties. Fairfax and participating corporations should abandon the Index forthwith.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In such a context, salt‐affected lands are a valuable resource that cannot be neglected nor easily abandoned even with their lower crop yields, especially in areas where significant investments have already been made in irrigation and drainage infrastructure. A review of previous studies shows a very limited number of highly variable estimates of the costs of salt‐induced land degradation combined with methodological and contextual differences. Simple extrapolation suggests that the global annual cost of salt‐induced land degradation in irrigated areas could be US$ 27.3 billion because of lost crop production. We present selected case studies that highlight the potential for economic and environmental benefits of taking action to remediate salt‐affected lands. The findings indicate that it can be cost‐effective to invest in sustainable land management in countries confronting salt‐induced land degradation. Such investments in effective remediation of salt‐affected lands should form part of a broader strategy for food security and be defined in national action plans. This broader strategy is required to ensure the identification and effective removal of barriers to the adoption of sustainable land management, such as perverse subsidies. Whereas reversing salt‐induced land degradation would require several years, interim salinity management strategies could provide a pathway for effective remediation and further showcase the importance of reversing land degradation and the rewards of investing in sustainable land management.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We find that parents caring more about school academic performance are more likely to have their children enrolled in public schools at the secondary school level, while parents taking into account peers’ socioeconomic background and school values are more likely to select voucher schools. We also show that while private voucher schools “cream skim” the best students from the socioeconomic standpoint, this does not necessarily hold for high ability students. JEL classification: I2.

Second, how to develop ethical instruments and standards capable of helping resolve ethical dilemmas that commonly occur in the public sector. Third, how to institutionalize ethical principles and instruments developed in public institutions. Both theoretical studies and empirical experiences indicate that the essence of the various forms of a dilemma in the public sector is the conflict between personal virtue and public virtue. These ethical dilemmas may be subdued by institutionalizing ethical principles in public institutions, and it basically involves two substantial activities, namely integration, and revitalization of ethical principles in public institutions. These ethical principles should be integrated within a system of conducts covering standard values and norms that serve as a reference in conducting oneself and in minimizing unethical conducts and in preventing maladministration in public sector management. Legal instruments remain necessary in order to ensure the effectiveness of ethical principles as a code of conduct for government personnel to carry out their tasks and functions.

Our empirical analysis also relied on transactional theories of reading informed by cultural criticism and Whiteness studies. We focus on four themes that cut across the books in our findings: White talk, colorblind theories of race, historicizing racism, and the privileging effect.

Though firmly entrenched around the city, the Continentals lacked food, clothing, powder, and most importantly, men. Barely three thousand strong, Washington feared that unless Congress issued the necessary funds, the “lines will be so weakened” that the notoriously undisciplined Minute Men would have to fill in the regimental gaps. Decrying a “...dearth of public spirit, and want of virtue” that he saw rampant in the Congress and merchant class, Washington trembled at the “ultimate end of these maneuvers.” Even worse were his own men; the Connecticut troops were refusing to reenlist without pay, a reaction that severely undermined Washington’s faith in the army. “Such a dirty, mercenary spirit pervades the whole,” he wrote his personal secretary, Joseph Reed, “that I should not be surprised at any disaster that may happen.” Washington’s fear of a “mercenary spirit” was certainly justified, but money was not the only insidious motive that jeopardized the great undertaking. Six months earlier, Benedict Arnold captured Fort Ticonderoga and secured the canons that would liberate Boston; but just four years later he would become early America’s most infamous defector. How could one who risked life – and in Arnold’s case, limb – or liberty change sides? I argue that many revolutionaries were in fact mercenaries – that is, when independence collided with their primary motivation, be it honor, prestige, or selfpreservation – their true colors were shown. An examination of two lesser-known traitors – Ethan Allen and Herman Zedtwitz – as well a consideration of Native Americans and African slaves will show that a “mercenary spirit” drove many to both join and abandon the war effort, a motivation stronger than revolutionary ideology. 2 Treachery is by nature visceral, cutting deep grooves into the collective memory of a society. Traitors are the antithesis of heroes, bereft of virtue, and doomed by posterity.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

I answer this question by surveying UN responses to a variety of alleged genocides, ranging from Biafra starting in the late 1960s to contemporary Iraq and Syria. In terms of quantitative analysis, the article explores whether UN responses to claims of genocide have been proportionate to the scale of actual harm, using absolute death tolls and percentage reductions in the populations of specific minority groups to assess harm. It finds that voting blocs based on racial or religious identity may be warping the UN response to potential genocides, resulting to inattention to many cases in which the extinction of unpopular or ignored racial or religious groups is threatened.The article finds that the United Nations devotes disproportionate attention to some conflicts, based on the identity of the perpetrators or victims rather than the scale of actual or potential harm to life and property. In this regard, the Arab League, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Republic of Turkey appear to play important roles in shaping UN responses. In terms of qualitative analysis, the article surveys evidence that key actors at the United Nations may have been motivated by bias in framing collective responses to claims of genocide and other mass violence. This evidence ranges from politicians' or diplomats' statements suggesting solidarity or the lack thereof with certain racial and religious groups, and hatred or suspicion of some racial or religious groups.The stories told within the United Nations often ignore indigenous populations, including in the Western Hemisphere and Australasia, but also in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa. This article explores failures to prevent genocide since 1945, with a particular focus on how prevention may be inhibited by ethnic, racial, and religious bias within the United Nations. Although the United Nations has the primary responsibility under the Genocide Convention to deal with allegations of genocide, its members have ignored numerous large massacres of indigenous racial and religious minorities in Nigeria, Iraq, Sudan, and elsewhere. The Arab monarchies and the Republic of Turkey have managed to mobilize voting blocs within the United Nations in favor of their idiosyncratic view of genocide as primarily affecting their co-religionists. The definition of genocide employed by diplomats at the United Nations varies dramatically in practice, as the members of the United Nations are very selective in condemning certain states' persecution or killing of minorities as criminal or genocidal.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

There is a need to engage with and understand the life experiences, transformations and social concerns of people affected by conflict before, during and after the conflict in order to develop appropriate and context embedded post-conflict reconstruction strategies. This article discusses how life histories were deployed to explore how the 20-year conflict in northern Uganda transformed people's lives. It presents how 47 men and women lived, experienced and remembered the war in northern Uganda, and the implications for health care reconstruction.

An Analysis of Wages in Privileged Employment","We maintain that a subtle and hitherto unrecognized form of racial inequality at the privileged occupational level is emerging. “New governance” reform, a rapidly encroaching form of privatization which has altered conditions of work and the status of workers is causing African American women to lose the public sector as the long-standing “occupational niche” in managerial and professional employment. Findings from Integrated Public Use Micro-Series data indicate that—in the context of wages—the new “business logic” characterized most importantly by enhanced managerial discretion, has progressively disadvantaged African American women, relative, White gender counterparts. Specifically, relative parity in wages achieved in the public sector, compared to the private sector in 1996 period progressively eroded across two time points, 2003 and 2010 because of widening racial gaps in the public sector. Further, niche status varies across occupational categories: wage gaps widen more in managerial than in professional positions. We discuss prospects for the public sector to remain an occupational niche for African American women in privileged employment and call for more research on racial stratification in the public sector.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

On reflexivity, requisite variety, and requisite irony","There has been growing interest in the past twenty years or so in the potential contribution of new forms of governance to solving co-ordination problems in and across a wide range of specialised social systems (such as the economy, the legal system, the political system, and the health system) and in the lifeworld (or, broadly understood, civil society). This interest is reflected in growing ambiguities about the meaning of governance. For the purposes of this contribution, however, I adopt a relatively narrow definition of governance. Thus governance is defined as the reflexive self-organisation of independent actors involved in complex relations of reciprocal interdependence, with such self-organisation being based on continuing dialogue and resource-sharing to develop mutually beneficial joint projects and to manage the contradictions and dilemmas inevitably involved in such situations. Governance organised on this basis need not entail a complete symmetry in power relations or complete equality in the distribution of benefits: indeed, it is highly unlikely to do so almost regardless of the object of governance or the â��stakeholdersâ�� who actually participate in the governance process. All that is involved in this preliminary definition is the commitment on the part of those involved to reflexive self-organisation in the face of complex reciprocal interdependence.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This raises the question of whether governments privatize firms strategically. In this paper we examine the determinants of the sequencing of privatization. To obtain testable predictions about the factors that may affect sequencing, we investigate the following competing government objectives: (i) Maximizing efficiency through resource allocation; (ii) maximizing public goodwill from the free transfers of shares to the public; (iii) minimizing political costs; (iv) maximizing efficiency through information gains; and (v) maximizing privatization revenues. Next, we use firm-level data from the Czech Republic to test the competing predictions about the sequencing of privatization. Consistent with the hypotheses of a government priority on revenues and public goodwill, we find strong evidence that more profitable firms were privatized first. The sequencing of privatization is also consistent with maximizing efficiency through information gains. Our results indicate that many empirical studies of the effects of privatization on firm performance suffer from a selection bias.","[{""country"":[""Czech Republic""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We find that fragmentation affects all stocks; more fragmented stocks have lower transactions costs and faster execution speeds; and fragmentation is associated with higher short-term volatility but greater market efficiency, in that prices are closer to being a random walk.

Relatively few studies, however, consider the power interests at stake. Why do state agencies decentralize power, what political patterns unfold, and how do outcomes affect the responses of resource users? This paper explores decentralization reform by investigating the political processes behind the Philippine state's decisions to transfer authority over national parks management to local government units. Drawing on a case of devolved management at Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Palawan Island, we examine how political motives situated at different institutional scales affect the broader process of decentralization, the structure of management institutions, and overall livelihood security. We demonstrate how power struggles between the Philippine state and City Government of Palawan over the right to manage the national park have impacted the livelihood support offered by community-based conservation.

An autobiographical account of this condition gives clinicians and researchers a unique opportunity to explore how a patient may view their episode of postnatal psychosis, and how when this account is interpreted through a biomedical lens, new person-centred treatment possibilities can be developed. Aim: This paper aims to demonstrate how to understand a woman’s lived experience of postnatal psychosis by examining an autobiographical account of the condition, found in The Book of Margery Kempe. Research design: A qualitative research design based on a textual analysis approach was used. Methods: The text was read against the domains of the common-sense model of illness (identity, cause, consequence, control-treatment, control-personal, coherence and emotional representation). Specific extracts were categorised into each domain and read closely to determine how a patient’s account of their illness can be interpreted usefully for healthcare plans. Results: The autobiographical account of postnatal psychosis gives fresh insights into how patients reconstruct the condition from memory and what meaning they may attribute to the cause, progression, treatment and outcome of the illness. Conclusions and implications for practice: • Autobiographical accounts of a patient’s lived experience of illness can be powerful educational tools that healthcare professionals can use to develop a person-centred approach to treatment • Autobiography demonstrates how not listening to a patient can have a devastating effect on the treatment a patient receives • If researchers and clinicians come to understand how the patient makes meaning of their illness, treatment and care plans can take a more individualised and person-centred approach that could promote positive health outcomes and greater patient satisfaction","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The use of merger simulations and the sensitivity of predictions to modeling choices is illustrated with an application to mergers in the UK brewing industry. There have been a number of brewing mergers that have changed the structure of the UK market, as well as proposed but unconsummated mergers that would have had even more profound effects.

An Assessment Utilizing Data From Canadian Royal Commissions 1970-2000","The subsystem approach to policy studies is now well established in theory. Despite many applications to empirical cases, however, many elements of the operationalization of this approach have remained problematic, prompting some critics to reject it as “unscientific.” Although the approach has been defended as “more than a metaphor,” it is certainly apparent that additional work is required to address fundamental aspects of the model and ensure that its application to specific cases is done in such a way as to meet basic methodological prerequisites of consistency and replication. This article builds on earlier work by one of the authors attempting to address some of these concerns. Specifically, it addresses issues surrounding the methods through which subsystem membership can be identified and attempts some preliminary conclusions with respect to the estimation of average subsystem size in contemporary advanced liberal democracies.","[{""country"":[""Canada""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Sensor Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The research question examined in this paper is how organisational processes such as knowledge management and managerial processes such as the coordination between top managers specifically create dynamic capabilities. After reviewing the literature, several case studies are presented and the impact of these particular organisational and managerial processes on dynamic capabilities is examined in detail. The first case is a healthcare firm that used a managerial process; however, this firm did not achieve a dynamic capability. The other two cases specifically illustrate how a financial services firm used an organisational process and how a manufacturing firm used a managerial process to develop dynamic capabilities. In comparing these three cases, the three sets of activities that are necessary to develop a dynamic capability are demonstrated.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this call for researchers to pay more - and more nuanced - attention to cultural context, we contend that group identity-as expressed through affiliation with an oppressed group-can itself prompt meaningful role-based action. Public health's study of resilience, then, must consider the ways that individuals understand and, in turn, resist discrimination. In this article, we briefly outline the shortcomings of current perspectives on resilience as they pertain to the study of marginalized youth and then consider the potential protection offered by ideological commitment. To ground our conceptual argument, we use examples from two different groups with whom the authors have worked for many years: indigenous and sexual minority youth. Though these groups are dissimilar in many ways, the processes related to marginalization, identity and resilience are remarkably similar. Specifically, group affiliation can provide a context to reconceptualize personal difficulty as a politicized collective struggle, and through this reading, can create a platform for ideological commitment and resistance.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This Special Issue puts together seven empirical studies emerging from the Chinese societies. These studies analyse inclusive discourses embedded in the education policy documents; scrutinise professional competence of inclusive education teachers; evaluate inclusive education practices in physical education, mathematics education, and job-related social skills education provided to students with disabilities; debate the required in-class support for inclusive education teachers; and discuss the social attitudes towards people with disabilities. The foci, methods and theories vary across the seven studies, while their aims converge. These studies are seeking best possible approaches and best available resources that facilitate inclusion. Knowledge built and lessons learned from these studies will provide implications for future inclusive education practices in China and beyond.","[{""country"":[""China""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This article connects and contributes to these literatures by analyzing the impact of parenthood and family on political party development. I demonstrate the increasing salience of “parents” as a political ideal in late twentieth-century policy discourse, reveal an overarching organic family frame in which it was used, and trace this frame to Southern domestic ideals and to the growing importance of the South to the Republican Party.

One reason is that organic products do not meet the quality requirements of consumers, and another that consumers have been left out of food chain planning and decision-making for food selection. Co-operation among stakeholders is weak, and activity is based on power that is, for example, widening the price margin. Government interaction through taxation, legislation, and subsidies does not benefit the organic food system. The criteria for evaluating stakeholder activities—food production processes and products (food)—are only quantitative and financial rather than being qualitative and built on accommodating consumer values. The earlier mentioned variables were entered into Yrjo Engestroms’ Activity Theory model to study their interactions. According to extensive research into consumer opinions on organic production and food, customers value safety, ecology, health, ethicality, and taste. By using the Economy of Common Good Theory’s principles and adding those factors to the evaluation criteria for the process and the food, food suppliers would enlist consumers as co-creators and co-innovators and enable stakeholders in organic food production to face the challenges better and meet the goals set for the organic food chain. It is also necessary to have better government interaction so that it can achieve its own goals. The Activity Theory Model will also help the conventional food chain to improve in quality.","[{""country"":[""Finland""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

These will be analyzed according to their focus on 1) the plight of the illegal immigrant; 2) the violence that has become a daily factor in the lives of border citizens; and 3) the symbolic efforts to make a sacred space out of one as seemingly unsacred as the border; and if not a sacred space, one that is more transparent and hopefully, less dangerous and threatening.

Nigro* The University of Texas at El Paso The nearly 2,000-mile border between Mexico and the United States has long been a paradox, experienced as well as imagined by citizens of both countries as a space of desire and revulsion, pleasure and pain, life and death. In the early twenty-first century—the time of NAFTA, illegal immigration and ruthlessly powerful drug cartels—the border is seen by many as a threat to these neighboring countries: to the “homeland security” and economy of the United States, and to the very existence of Mexico as a law-abiding and viable nation-state. The building of walls in an era of globalization is the latest contradiction of this extensive border: it is open and often invisible as an economic passage way, while also increasingly closed and visible as a crossing point for human transit. Given these paradoxes, it is not surprising that artists who personally live this border experience should find it rich material for their work. Although the political and economic challenges of the border are prime features in the news media, the ones that get the most and loudest sound bites, there is another border phenomenon that also merits close attention: the arts, which have so blossomed there that a city as maligned as Tijuana was heralded by Newsweek as a cultural mecca for our new century.1 This essay will consider the performative arts on the border, ranging from script-based plays to performance pieces in urban spaces and public installation pieces.

The reform of the private pension system in some countries in the region allows for the implementation of a mechanism of auctions on fees to capture new members. The objective of this mechanism was to drop fees and promote competition. We concluded that the effect on fees is successful since fees dropped while the effect on competition is ambiguous according to our panel data model and the measurement of efficiency.

Particularly significant was the credentialing of selected blogs as officially designated media sources for purposes of covering the major political party conventions, an act which gave particular legitimacy to two contending groups of partisan blogs (one credentialed for the Republican National Convention (RNC) and the other for the Democratic National Convention (DNC)). In the months that followed, these blogs served as significant foci for online journalistic, promotional, fund-raising, and organizing activities relating to the 2004 election. In this study, we employ a dynamic logistic choice model to study the dynamics of interaction within and between these two groups of political blogs. Using a longitudinal sample of all DNC and RNC-designated blog citation networks (sampled at six hour intervals for approximately four months) from Butts and Cross (2009) we are able to test for the influence of various strategic, institutional, and balance-theoretic mechanisms – as well as exogenous factors such as seasonality and political events – on the propensity of blogs to cite (i.e., hyperlink to) one another over time. Capitalizing on the temporal resolution of our data, we utilize an autoregressive network regression framework to carry out inference for a logistic choice process closely related to the actororiented framework of Snijders (2001). Using a combination of deviance-based model selection criteria (e.g. BIC) and simulation-based goodness-of-fit tests akin to Hunter et al. (2008), we identify the combination of processes that best characterizes the choice behavior of the contending blogs. We conclude with a discussion of the potential for autoregressive network regression as a practical way of “scaling up” dynamic choice models for use with high-resolution data sets.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

By doing so, they are able to explore how actors of interest used their relationships to undertake business and economic endeavors, and how, in turn, these were shaped by the discourse to which they had access. This paper presents a novel methodology using visual analytics to combine both social network (relationship) and textual (sentiment) analysis to visualize the information contained in historical sources over time. The definition of network narrative posited in this paper allows the historian to quantify and therefore assess the impact of, and reaction to, endogenous and exogenous events on actor networks. In order demonstrate the applicability of this approach, we apply it to the case study of Joshua Johnson, an American merchant in London during the 1772 credit crisis. This paper builds on the more recent network studies which show that networks were not only complex, but changed over time in reaction to events.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Levering open arenas once closed off to citizen voice or public scrutiny, these moves have helped to widen political space for citizens to play more of a part in shaping some of the decisions that affect their lives. Forms of political participation associated with liberal democracy have come to be complemented with a new architecture of democratic practice, built on familiar foundations and offering ambiguous new political opportunities.

One of its outcomes is the definition of the optimized locations for groundwater withdrawal. Such a tool permits the analysis of alternative plans for groundwater extraction and the sustainable use of water resources in a coastal aquifer subject to saltwater intrusion. The principal components are the evolutionary optimization and the analytical/numerical simulation models. The optimization technique looks for the best well locations taking into consideration the economic results and the satisfaction of the societal water demand. However these two concerns are conditioned by trying to control the saltwater intrusion, i.e., preserving the environmental equilibrium. The simulation model uses the governing mathematical equations for groundwater movement to find the interface between freshwater and saltwater. Because of the non-linearity in the system and the possibility of a jumping interface, a security distance was defined. This is a controlling variable which can be set by the decision makers. The model was applied to a typical case with interesting results. For example, diagrams showing the relationship between the location of the wells and the security distance(s) are of importance to the managers. It was also crucial to have an understanding of the tradeoffs between groundwater withdrawals, positions of the wells from the coast line, and the security distance. The model was also applied to a real case in order to relate the extractions, distances and artificial recharge (not presented in this paper).","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Modeling the spatial economy of Brazil using the usual assumptions of CGE models makes little sense when one state, Sao Paulo, accounts for 40% of GDP and where transportation costs are high and accessibility low compared to European or North American standards. Hence, handling market imperfections becomes imperative as does the need to address internal spatial issues from the perspective of Brazil's increasing involvement with external markets such as MERCOSUL, EU, NAFTA. The paper builds on the B-MARIA-27, a multiregional CGE model of the Brazilian economy; non-constant returns and non-iceberg transportation costs are introduced and some simulation exercises carried out. The results, limited in this paper to short-run considerations, confirm the asymmetric impacts that transportation investment has on a spatial economy in which one state (Sao Paulo) is able to more fully exploit scale economies vis a vis the rest of Brazil. The analysis also reveals the importance of parameter estimation in handling imperfectly competitive markets.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This essay explores how the symbolic and physical deaths these three characters suffer in these films, and how Im Kwon-Taek, through these quintessential male protagonists, seeks to constitute his unique national subject. In an attempt to articulate that the national subject cultivated by Im Kwon-Taek must be perceived as a relational term that constantly refers and defers to the presence of the national other, the main theoretical framework draws from Foucault’s concept of “crisis heterotopia.” This essay begins with a discussion on a Japanese character, Tani, the earliest form of national subject in Im Kwon-Taek’s 1978 film Chokpo , an adaptation from Kajiyama Toshiyuki’s short story “ Zokufu ,” set in the late colonial period when Japan urged Korea to abandon its own identity and instead adopt Japanese names, language, and values. I propose that the nascent form of Im Kwon-Taek’s nation-ness already had its transnational roots that are not only embedded in the complicated condition of naisen ittai (squashing of the two bodies of Korea and Japan into one), but also the combined effort by Japanese and Koreans to self-reflexively come to terms with their scarred pasts. The lamentation of the vanishing Korean identity surely is one of the themes continually projected in Im’s works since the late 1970s—of course Sŏp’yŏnje and Ch’wihwasŏn being prime examples among many—but this melancholic minjok, this essay insists, must be registered as a fulfillment of a modest, averted, and even transnational gaze of the camera in order for Im to create new cinematic language of a post-traumatic nation since the late 1970s.","[{""country"":[""Japan"",""Korea, Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Exploiting sharp eligibility criteria in a regression discontinuity design, we find robust evidence of a behavioural effect of the labelling. On average households spend 41% of the WFP on fuel.

How to enable students to become media literate users of information resources","This paper is a review of what current guidelines, standards, and case studies tell us about dimensions of competencies and skills learned through quality media and information literacy activities in universities and libraries. “We must prepare young people for living in a world of powerful images, words and sounds.” UNESCO’s 1982 statement on the importance of promoting media literacy competencies is still highly relevant. Media and information literacy education for young people provides a new pedagogy and framework for an essential 21 st century survival skill. According to the National Communication Association (NCA) media literacy is a “fundamental competency for literate citizens”. In 1998 the NCA defined “20 Standards for Speaking, Listening, and Media Literacy Education in K-12 Education” which mark the start of conceptualizing and defining competencies in media literacy. In media-educational contexts, the role of librarians as gatekeepers of the media is recognized as vital. With the emergence of the umbrella concept of information literacy, their role as teachers in media and information literacy instruction has been redefined to support the learning process as mediators and partners. Developments in media education and digital technologies have spurred academic librarians to new breakthroughs in integrating information and technology skills into the curriculum in higher education. In practice, librarians and media educators often disagree about the role of media or information literacy in the library or within the curriculum in school or university. For example, academic librarians engaged in IL instruction aim to train students in specific skills of information retrieval and not in metacompetencies required for lifelong learning. This understanding of information literacy is challenged by information professionals who believe that this focus is too narrow: their approach centers on the importance of educating students or library users in a broad manner in order to participate in a complex information society.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The objective of this research is to use Monetary Policy Compliance Rate Models, to assess the level of commercial banks compliance to the specified monetary policy credit guidelines. The researcher used secondary data on the sectoral distribution of credits commercial banks submitted to the Central Bank of Nigeria. The economic sectors were classified as production which embraces Agriculture, Forestry Fishery, Manufacturing Mining and Quarrying, Real Estate and Construction. Statistically, the compliance rate models were used to assess the level of compliance of commercial banks to the stipulated monetary policy. The research tested two hypotheses which have revealed that in sectoral allocation era 1991-1993, commercials banks did not comply to the monetary policy credit guidelines, but during the high priority and others, 1994-1996, commercial banks complied to the monetary policy credit guidelines.

Unfortunately, if one of those three candidates should die there is no way to provide a substitute, so the dead candidate’s supporters and party would be disenfranchised.Section 4 of the Twentieth Amendment, ratified in 1933, addressed this situation; it authorized Congress to legislate a process for substituting a new candidate. But for eighty-three years Congress (along with scholars) has never seriously considered Section 4 — let alone passed legislation under it. This neglect has fostered a dangerous incentive for assassination in the presidential electoral system. In every other stage in the process, dead candidates can be replaced; only here can an assassin eliminate an entire party from consideration in the election. A contingent election would be dramatic enough as it is; without Section 4 legislation, a candidate’s death could turn the election from a drama into a disaster.Part I of this Article provides context and background on Section 4.

School heads, as official ‘captains’ of the school, have an overriding oversight of curriculum implementation. The buck stops with them at the school level with regard to students’ performance. Teachers, because they have no expressed contract with the employer to deliver, cannot be held accountable for the students’ performance. However, the fact that they are on payroll makes their position in the accountability framework unclear and therefore difficult to place. The Minister for Education, who is mandated politically to see to the provision of quality education in schools, is ultimately accountable. The parents, the students, and other politicians other than the one for education, have only a social and moral responsibility involvement and not a legal requirement demanding their accountability. The paper recommends that higher authorities in education should continue their efforts to encourage parents and other significant stakeholders to take interest and participate in education matters at schools.","[{""country"":[""Botswana""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

I present econometric evidence showing that the trans-Atlantic slave trade increased absolutism in pre-colonial West Africa by approximately 17% to 35%, while reducing democracy and liberalism. I argue that this slavery-induced absolutism also influenced the structure of African political institutions in the colonial era and beyond. I present aggregate evidence showing that British colonies that exported more slaves in the era of the slave trade were ruled more-indirectly by colonial administrations. I argue that indirect colonial rule relied on sub-national absolutisms to control populations and extract surplus, and in the process transformed absolutist political customs into rule of law. The post-colonial federal authority, like the colonial authority before it, lacked the administrative apparatus and political clout to integrate these local authorities, even when they wanted to. From this perspective, state-failure in West Africa may be rooted in a political and economic history that is unique to Africa in many respects, a history that dates at least as far back as the era of the transatlantic slave trade.","[{""country"":[""Africa Western and Central""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

An approach of building process theory from cases traces learning events in the technological innovation approaches of three securities custodians facing an increasingly dynamic market. The article extends and elaborates the dynamic capability learning framework (Lecler, 2013) which proposes that managers recognise learning opportunities through two types of learning, expert and entrepreneurial, with variants for technological and organisational problem solving. The concept of entrepreneurial learning is further elaborated to help explain differences in the learning patterns found. Distinctive characteristics of the two types of learning are proposed pertaining to opportunity recognition and realisation, and the problem solving strategy. The framework helps to analyse data in terms of four learning patterns: expert honing and aligning, and entrepreneurial shaping and configuring. Further, entrepreneurial learning is suggested to facilitate dynamic capability development in a highly dynamic environment.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In particular, we explored how the middle school science teachers decide pedagogical approaches to use in their teaching based on classroom climate, students` attitude toward learning science, school curriculum and classroom culture. Using a phenomenological research approach, we analyzed classroom observation data and interview data to interpret the teachers` science teaching experience. Results of the study showed that the teachers` practice was dominantly affected by two external factors. First, the teachers` teaching practice was affected by the amount of science content knowledge they need to cover within a given class time. Second, the teachers` teaching practice was affected by students` attitudes toward science learning and their science preparedness in private tutoring centers. Implications of the study results are discussed in the paper.","[{""country"":[""Korea, Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

They served in India and then for six years in Singapore. Jaffarian was an associate research editor for the second edition of the World Christian Encyclopedia and now serves as Coordinator of Research for CBInternational. F some years now, the idea that there are more FourFifths-World missionaries than Western missionaries has been showing up in various missions presentations and publications. Unfortunately, it is just not true.1 This idea stems from Larry Pate’s 1989 book From Every People, which makes a very important contribution to our understanding of the Four-Fifths-World missions movement. He projected, “If both the Western missionary force and the Two-Thirds World missionary force continue to grow at their current rates . . . [by 2000] the majority of Protestant missionaries will be from the non-Western world.” More specifically, “The number of Two-Thirds World missionaries holds the very real promise of surpassing the number of Western missionaries by the year 2000.” Though Pate warned that “a projection is not a prediction,” still the idea has been launched that this projection has become reality.2 It is one of the great items of missiometrical misinformation of our time.3 Note two important things about this assertion. First, for Four-Fifths-World missionaries, Pate counted both domestic and foreign missionaries, but for the Western world he counted only foreign missionaries. (Foreign missionaries leave their country of citizenship to serve God in another country; domestic missionaries serve cross-culturally within their own land, such as those from South India who serve among tribal peoples in central India, or Anglo-Americans who serve among Asians, Hispanics, or international students in America.) To arrive at a fair conclusion, Pate should have compared the same kind of missionaries—either foreign only or both foreign and domestic—for both regions of the world. He did not, however, and thus the size of the Four-Fifths-World missionary force is disproportionately large (or that of the Western world too small); the comparison is not valid. Second, Pate projected that the Four-Fifths-World missionary force would maintain a constant growth rate, with no slowing of the pace. Over time, however, new social or religious movements rarely show a consistent pattern of growth. There is almost always a significant slowing of the growth rate of such movements, and the growth rate of the Four-Fifths-World missions movement since 1989 has been no exception. Pate’s projection was thus built on the foundation of these two errors. Since 1989 both David Barrett in the World Christian Encyclopedia and the team of Patrick Johnstone and Jason Mandryk in Operation World have done the actual counting, and both show that Pate’s projection failed to come true. The second edition of the World Christian Encyclopedia (2001) shows the number of all Christian missionaries, from all ecclesiastical traditions. By the authors’ count, as shown in table 1, in the year 2000 there were more than four times as many Western missionaries as missionaries from the Four-Fifths World.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The Oslo Principles, adopted on March 2015, tried to discern the legal obligations of states and to a lesser extent enterprises. The Enterprises Principles will map the legal obligations of enterprises, financiers and long term investors such as pension funds. Both set of principles are based on an interpretation of the law as it stands or will likely develop. This article and Philip Sutherland’s contribution to this volume focus on the core obligations of both the Oslo and the Enterprises Principles. Since the adoption of the Oslo Principles a lot has happened.

I show that the possibility of a unilateral influence contest is equally problematic. States can exert unilateral influence on autonomous international bureaucrats, either through rewards or through punishments, to pursue their particular interests. A costly contest results, so some states could refuse to delegate because they expect others to be too influential. The analysis has four counterintuitive empirical implications. First, international agreements often favor institutionally weak states that are disadvantaged in the unilateral influence contest. Second, states could limit the autonomy of an international organization even if this prompts bad policies. Third, a state can sometimes profitably exchange distributional concessions for autonomy. Finally, constraints on unilateral influence are possible only if a disadvantaged state can credibly commit to compensating an advantaged state for it. A central broader contribution of the analysis is to show how power politics influences the rational design of international institutions.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

This article presents the case of Milton Keynes, an English new town designated in 1967. Our study investigated the speech of a sample of 48 working-class children divided into three age groups: four, eight, and twelve years of age, along with one caregiver for each. We hypothesize that the formation of a new dialect is in the gift of older children. We also hypothesize that dialect leveling, which is part of koineization, will be more rapid in a new town than in an old-established town. Detailed quantitative results for four vowels strongly support these hypotheses. At the same time, we investigate the social network types contracted by new town residents. We found many to be socially isolated locally, but that they maintained contacts with their place of origin. We show that migrants violate what the Milroys argue to be the normal inverse relationship between socioeconomic class and social network density: migrants have uniplex networks, while still having a low socioeconomic status. The consequences for dialect change are considered.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Anglo-American Relations and the Iraq War","On 26 February 2003, British Prime Minister Tony Blair faced the largest parliamentary rebellion in over a hundred years. Some 120 of his Labour Party colleagues voted against the government's policy of support for US military action against Iraq. Earlier that month, more than one million people had taken to the streets of London to protest against the prospect of war, while respondents to a UK Internet poll had voted America the country that posed the greatest threat to world peace. The UK's major partners in Europe--France and Germany--also opposed Britain's stance, the government having singularly failed in its self-appointed role of providing a bridge of understanding between Europe and the United States. Prime Minister Blair faced personal attacks in the media, being frequently portrayed as America's lap dog; even Nelson Mandela referred to him disapprovingly as the foreign minister of the United States. The Prime Minister's political survival itself seemed to be at stake. In the face of such pressures, it would have been understandable if the British government had taken a less determined position on Iraq. In spite of the oft-touted ""special relationship,"" British and American governments have not always seen eye-to-eye during international crises. But that was not the case. Notwithstanding dissension and resignations from his Cabinet, Prime Minister Blair's advocacy of the Bush Administration's hard line on Iraq hardly wavered, diplomatic support remained constant and vigorous, and Britain was the only American ally to make a sizable military contribution to the campaign. It is not surprising then that Tony Blair has been hailed as a hero in the United States, becoming the first Briton since Winston Churchill to be nominated for a Congressional Gold Medal. Blair's firm leadership was critical to sustaining the British government's support for US policy in Iraq. For some commentators, the Prime Minister's resolve demonstrated principled, international statesmanship; to others it displayed a naive faith in American virtue. Regardless, foreign policy in a parliamentary democracy is rarely made at the whim of even a powerful personality like Tony Blair. (1) There are many factors beside Blair's leadership that helped to shape the government's thinking. These included the long-standing special Anglo-American relationship, an institutionalized habit of security cooperation between the two countries, an ambitious perception of Britain's role in the modern world, and an apparently genuine conviction that Saddam Hussein's regime posed a threat to national security. This article addresses these issues and places them in historical context. It also draws conclusions about the British government's support for US policy on Iraq and its significance for Anglo-American relations in the medium term. A Special Relationship The partnership between the United States and United Kingdom has been described as ""a relationship rooted in common history, common values, and common interests around the globe."" (2) It has been become a journalistic cliche to refer to this as a ""special relationship,"" but such a description has been in common usage since first coined by Winston Churchill during his famous ""Iron Curtain"" speech at Fulton, Missouri, in 1946. The close diplomatic and military relationship between the UK and the United States had its origins in the strategic partnership of the Second World War. It was sustained by common security concerns throughout the Cold War, and was revived in the 1990s by a mutual recognition of the need to cooperate against new threats to international peace and stability. After 9/11, Prime Minister Blair's proactive role in the war against terrorism and his strong, supportive line on Iraq brought new vigor to the Anglo-American partnership. On a visit to Britain in May 2003, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, not a notable Anglophile, exclaimed, ""The special relationship between the US and the UK is stronger than ever, and Americans are the better for it. …","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

CTVT first arose several thousand years ago and has been reported in dog populations worldwide; however, its precise distribution patterns and prevalence remain unclear. We analysed historical literature and obtained CTVT prevalence information from 645 veterinarians and animal health workers in 109 countries in order to estimate CTVT’s former and current global distribution and prevalence. This analysis confirmed that CTVT is endemic in at least 90 countries worldwide across all inhabited continents. CTVT is estimated to be present at a prevalence of one percent or more in dogs in at least 13 countries in South and Central America as well as in at least 11 countries in Africa and 8 countries in Asia. In the United States and Australia, CTVT was reported to be endemic only in remote indigenous communities. Comparison of current and historical reports of CTVT indicated that its prevalence has declined in Northern Europe, possibly due to changes in dog control laws during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Analysis of factors influencing CTVT prevalence showed that presence of free-roaming dogs was associated with increased CTVT prevalence, while dog spaying and neutering were associated with reduced CTVT prevalence. Our analysis indicated no gender bias for CTVT and we found no evidence that animals with CTVT frequently harbour concurrent infectious diseases. Vincristine was widely reported to be the most effective therapy for CTVT. Our results provide a survey of the current global distribution of CTVT, confirming that CTVT is endemic in at least 90 countries worldwide. Additionally, our analysis highlights factors that continue to modify CTVT’s prevalence around the world and implicates free-roaming dogs as a reservoir for the disease. Our analysis also documents the disappearance of the disease from the United Kingdom during the twentieth century, which appears to have been an unintentional result of the introduction of dog control policies.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

First, we discuss results from O'Connor and Bruner (2016) showing that underrepresented groups in academia can be disadvantaged in collaboration and bargaining by dint of their small numbers. Second, we present novel results exploring how the hierarchical structure of academia can lead to bargaining disadvantage. We investigate models where one actor has a higher baseline of academic success, less to lose if collaboration goes south, or greater rewards for non-collaborative work. We show that in these situations, the less powerful partner can be disadvantaged in bargaining over collaboration.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Several aspects of this much studied problem are clarified. Our numerical data show unambiguously that, in the shear flow, the domains have on average an elliptic shape. The time evolution of the three parameters describing this ellipse are obtained for a wide range of shear rates. For the lowest shear rates investigated, we find the growth laws for the two principal axis $R_\perp (t) \sim constant$, $R_\parallel(t) \sim t$, while the mean orientation of the domains with respect to the flow is inversely proportional to the strain. This implies that when hydrodynamics is neglected a shear flow does not stop the domain growth process. We investigate also the possibility of dynamic scaling, and show that only a non trivial form of scaling holds, as predicted by a recent analytical approach to the case of a non-conserved order parameter. We show that a simple physical argument may account for these results.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Among the several features of those digital communities, some differences among men’s and women’s communication behaviours seem to be real when they play video games. Thus, the objective of this research is to analyse gender differences in the socialisation process among MOG Players (Multiplayer Online Game). To this aim, this research introduces an experiment with 201 MOG players (males: 147; females: 54) who responded to a survey concerning the use of 20 social communicative acts (based on Guntermann and June, 1982, p. 26) in three different contexts: the participant knew in advance the other player from a) the real world, b) the virtual world, or c) they had never met before. The results obtained from this analysis have shown some differences between both male and female MOG participants in their socialisation process when interacting with other players by determining the frequency and the per cent variation on the use of the selected communicative acts. In conclusion, it seems that there are some similarities and differences between men and women when interacting with MOG players that may interfere in the way they play videogames and behave towards other players.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The Case of Public-Sector Labor Laws","Schattschneider’s insight that “policies make politics” has played an influential role in the modern study of political institutions and public policy. Yet if policies do indeed make politics, rational politicians clearly have opportunities to use policies to create a future structure of politics more to their own advantage — and this strategic dimension has gone almost entirely unexplored. Do politicians actually use policies to make politics? Under what conditions? In this paper, we develop a theoretical argument about what can be expected from strategic politicians, and we carry out an empirical analysis on a policy development that is particularly instructive: the adoption of public sector collective bargaining laws by the states during the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s — laws that fueled the rise of public sector unions, and “made politics” to the great advantage of Democrats over Republicans.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We used the Autoregressive Distributed Lag method considering the ratio of Liquid liabilities, Private credit and Stock market capitalization as financial development indicators (all per cent of GDP). The sum of export and import as a percentage of GDP is the measurement of trade openness. Our estimates imply that the long and short-run relationships are different. At long run, trade openness is stimulated by liquid liabilities level while it is negatively affected by the level of private credit and the stock market capitalization. In contrast, the main short-run responses of financial development and openness to international trade are not significant. Moreover, the results reveal a bi-directional causality between private credit and trade openness but a direct unidirectional causality running from financial intermediariesâ€™ ability to mobilize funds, the size of stock market and trade openness in Tunisia. The policy implications of this study appeared clear. The overcoming of the institutional weaknesses and the establishment of transparent rules are likely to improve the efficiency of the banking sector and the stock market and so to strengthen the foreign trade in Tunisia.","[{""country"":[""Tunisia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

METHODS:The cost-effectiveness analysis model was applied to data derived from a previous clinical study conducted in 1995 and 1996. This study involved 78 adult patients (62.8% female and 37.2% male) undergoing total hip replacement or total knee replacement procedures. Patients were enrolled in a ra n d o m i z e d ,double-blind manner to receive either ondansetron 4 mg intrv e n o u s l y (n=37) or prochlorperazine 10 mg intramuscularly (n=41) immediately upon completion of surgery and were monitored for occurrences of PONV during the subsequent 48 hours. In our analysis,we measured the cost-effectiveness ratio (C/E ratio),defined as the cost per successfully treated patient,for each antiemetic agent using the clinical data obtained from the previous study. RESULTS:The incidence of PONV and use of rescue antiemetics was significantly greater in the ondansetron group compared with the prochlorperazine group. The mean total costs of PONV management per patient in the prochlorperazine and ondansetron groups were $13.99 and $51.98,respectively (based on 2004 average wholesale prices [AWP]). The cost of successfully treating one patient with prochlorperazine and ondansetron was $31.87 and $275.01,respectively. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed adjusting the percent efficacy rate of each antiemetic and the drug cost of ondansetron (up to a 50% reduction in AWP). Prochlorperazine remained the dominant strategy across each scenario. CONCLUSION:The results indicate that prochlorperazine is a more cost-effective antiemetic compared with ondansetron for the prevention of PONV in a mixed gender,adult inpatient population undergoing total joint arthroplasty.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Instructors appeared to have effects on student learning beyond their impact on course completion rates. A variety of robustness checks suggested that these results do not appear to be driven by nonrandom matching of students and instructors based on unobserved characteristics or censoring of the dependent variable due to students who dropped the course before the final exam.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We now know that Vin Diesel is a person, not a truck, SpongeBob could be a sponge, the Rally Monkey probably is a monkey, and Anna Nicole is... Well, we’re still working on that one. In their own ways, our Page Ten personalities for 2002 were equally interesting. My thanks to Ruth Bentler, Theresa Ching, Greg Flamme, Carol Flexer, Richard Gans, Linda Hood, Bob Keith, George Lindley, Brad Stach, and Rick Talbott for their excellent contributions. While the 2002 team will be tough to beat, you’ll be glad to hear that we have another impressive array of guest authors lined up for the new year. We’re leading off 2003 with Kelly Tremblay, PhD, assistant professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the Brain and Behavior Laboratory. You’re probably familiar with Dr. Tremblay’s noted work over the past several years in the area of auditoryrelated brain behavior. Her publication on central auditory plasticity was named Ear and Hearing’s outstanding article of 2001, and her name comes up frequently in The Hearing Journal’s annual Best of Audiology section recognizing exceptional articles from the previous year. She is a regular contributor to Audiology Today, and serves as editorial assistant for several other audiology journals. When she isn’t collecting data, Kelly says she enjoys the outdoors. If you think this simply means a Saturday morning bike ride to the neighborhood Starbucks, think again. One of her recent “outings” was a trek in the Himalayas of Nepal! In her Page Ten article, Dr. Tremblay reviews much of the latest research on central auditory plasticity, and she lends us important insights into the potential clinical applications of this research. Through tests such as the late cortical AEPs, we know that peripheral auditory pathologies can cause changes in brain function. How does this relate to early intervention? To cochlear implant use? To hearing aid use? To hearing aid benefit? Can we use this information to help structure (and individualize) our auditory rehabilitative strategies? Kelly addresses all these questions and more. I think you’ll find this intriguing article an excellent way to start off your audiologic new year!","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Both fields are subject to various presuppositions that have consequences for how they manage the relationship of ethics implementation. Those presuppositions are related to the problem of “the construction of the norm” and the relationship – or absence of it in most governance theories – between norms and context. Ethicists seem to be reluctant to take into account the field of application of the norms created by the procedure it constructs. This is due mainly to a certain closure to elements other than rational argumentation in procedural ethics. Information systems’ professionals, as we have seen in a study undertaken for the IDEGOV project, also have a narrow vision of what is ethics. They often reduce ethics to a constraint that has to be fulfilled. They also have a very stereotypical vision of what are the issues present in the field of information systems – privacy, surveillance, and security – and how to answer these questions, mainly through more information. We will show that these presuppositions on both sides have a huge impact on the manner in which ethics is “done” in technical projects, and more importantly, we will give hints on how to improve the relationship. The term implementation is itself inappropriate, because it supposes that ethics is something external to information systems. This presupposition is shared to some extent by both fields i.e., ethics and information systems: it is the central point where we see the problem, but also the solution. Working on the framings of both ethical and technical communities is for us the way to overcome ethical problems in information system, and to reach appropriate ethical technology development.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

From Household Labour Force surveys conducted by the Turkish Statistical Institue, the study presented here depicts a panorama of informal employment in Turkey before the implementation of these measures. It responds to the need expressed by the Council of the European Union to hve an analysis of underclared work. From a desciptive analysis of the main features of informal jobs and from the estimation of the probability of informal employment, it brings out a number of lessons on how to target policies to combat informal employment in Turkey and on the people who encounter the greatest difficulties in accessing or participating in the market.","[{""country"":[""European Union"",""Turkey""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

High intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most critical risk factor. However, glaucoma develops even within a normal IOP range. Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is more common in Asia, whereas high tension glaucoma is more common in Western countries. The pathogenesis of glaucoma, especially NTG, is poorly understood. We evaluated the correlation between dietary nutrient intake and glaucoma using data from subjects ≥40 years old from the ongoing, nationwide, population-based study, the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V (2008-2012). Dietary intake was determined using the 24 h recall method. Fiber (g/day), ash (g/day), calcium (mg/day), phosphorus (mg/day), iron (mg/day), sodium (mg/day), potassium (mg/day), β-Carotene (μg/day), retinol (μg/day), vitamin A (μg Retinol Equivalents/day), thiamine (mg/day), riboflavin (mg/day), niacin (mg/day), and vitamin C (mg/day) were included in nutrient intake data. All nutrient intake was divided into quartiles. The mean IOP did not differ according to quartiles from any nutrients (all p > 0.05). After adjusting for age, gender, income status, education level, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diabetes, hypertension, IOP, and total energy, the intake of niacin was associated with glaucoma (p = 0.013). Among subjects with IOP ≤ 21 mmHg, only niacin was related to glaucoma in a multivariate analysis (p = 0.022). Dietary nutrient intake was associated with open-angle glaucoma independent of IOP. Individuals with NTG showed lower intake of niacin among nutrients.

Public sector reporting of heritage has been a long-standing issue, due to shortcomings in (sector-neutral) for-profit-based financial reporting standards. Australia’s sector-neutral approach does not meet public sector users’ information needs. The authors develop a heritage reporting model to balance community and other stakeholders’ interests and address prior critiques.,The paper reviews heritage reporting requirements in Anglo-Western Countries, and analyses commentaries and research publications. It evaluates the existing reporting requirements in the context of new public management (which focusses on information and efficiency) and new public governance (NPG) (focussing on balancing interests and quality).,The paper proposes an NPG-based heritage reporting model which includes indicators of performance on the five UNESCO (1972) dimensions and operational guidelines issued by UNESCO (2015). These are identification, presentation, protection, conservation and transmission. The proposed model is consistent with the notion of US SFFAS 29 (the standard for Federal entities). Not all heritage must be capitalised and hence attachment of monetary value, but detailed disclosures are necessary.,The authors expect the proposed heritage reporting model to better serve users of heritage information compared to the present Australian Accounting Standards Board 116: Property, Plant and Equipment.,The authors’ proposed model of heritage reporting attempts to answer Carnegie and Wolnizer’s (1995, 1999) six questions, addresses decades of concerns raised in previous literature and provides a new perspective to heritage reporting based on NPG that should better serve users’ needs.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Our identification strategy exploits the 1990 German reunification as a quasi-experiment. The treatment is an individual’s cumulative years of schooling under the socialist GDR system, assuming that its curriculum contributed less to the development of entrepreneurial values. The reunification induced a rapid change in the school system and curricula while the social environment changed gradually. To exploit this ceteris paribus change in schooling empirically, we compare GDR educated students to statistically similar West German counterparts. Next, we use time series variation to distinguish GDR students who finished school in the GDR and those who experienced some education in reunified Germany. Using various specifications and robustness test our results consistently suggest a positive effect of nonsocialist schooling on university students’ entrepreneurial intentions.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Offered meaningful but contradictory clues by both her images and her texts, viewers attempt to discover not only what the work of art conveys but how it communicates its contents, in investigations that parallel the artist's own. In Alice Aycock: Sculpture and Projects, Robert Hobbs examines the development of Aycock's work over twenty years and her negotiation -- along with other artists who came of age in the early 1970s -- of the transition from modernism to postmodernism.""The problem,"" wrote Aycock in 1977, ""seems to be how to connect without connecting."" Hobbs describes Aycock's strategies for doing just this: for creating a work with disparate image and texts that offer a new perspective on reality. Influenced by the ""specific objects"" of minimalism's hybrid forms and by conceptualism's emphasis on language, Aycock relies on paradigms, cybernetics, phenomenology, physics, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, information overload, outdated scientific thinking, and computer programming to create a ""complex"" that is architectural and sculptural as well as mental and emotional. Schizophrenia and other mental conditions, sometimes considered metaphors for the disconnections of postmodern existence, are specific sources of inspiration in Aycock's work. By exploring the physical and existential positions of isolation, estrangement, disorientation, entrapment and fear, her three-dimensional constructions not only posit alternative states of mind, they suppose possible narratives and suggest multiple truths and lies. Aycock's work invites the viewer to experience sculpture with the entire body and a fully mind. Her sculpture has had a transformative effect on the contemporary art experience.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

One such fishery for the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) has developed interactions with a range of predators, some of which are marine mammals capable of diving to extreme depths for extended periods. A deep-sea camera system deployed within a toothfish fishery operating in the Southern Ocean acquired the first-ever video footage of an extreme-diver, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), depredating catch from longlines set at depths in excess of 1000m. The interactions recorded were non-lethal, however independent fisheries observer reports confirm elephant seal-longline interactions can be lethal. The seals behaviour of depredating catch at depth during the line soak-period differs to other surface-breathing species and thus presents a unique challenge to mitigate their by-catch. Deployments of deep-sea cameras on exploratory fishing gear prior to licencing and permit approvals would gather valuable information regarding the nature of interactions between deep diving/dwelling marine species and longline fisheries operating at bathypelagic depths. Furthermore, the positive identification by sex and age class of species interacting with commercial fisheries would assist in formulating management plans and mitigation strategies founded on species-specific life-history strategies.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The current research examines a selected group of teachers"" understanding of reform and the impact of the cycle of reform on their attitudes about their profession. The teachers in this study, participants in a professional development experience supporting progressive reform efforts in California during the 1990s, responded to a survey and follow- up interviews were conducted with a representative sample. The findings indicate that participants were supportive of the reform movement, but felt ""left out"" of the decision- making process—especially when the reform movement ended. If cycles of reform continue in mathematics education, teachers may become less willing to participate in future reform efforts. Furthermore, cycles of reform may lead to a decrease in teacher morale, which may in turn lead to teachers leaving the profession, thereby further exacerbating the impending teacher shortage within and beyond the U.S. context.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Our focus is on Ariel, a 7th grade bilingual student from an urban district, over an 18-month period. He develops knowledge of both mathematics and the language (both oral and written) required for his successful problem solving and communication of this process. Three questions are addressed: (1) How does Ariel display his mathematical understanding during problem solving? (2) How does Ariel use the mathematics register while solving the problem? (3) What systems of representation, including language (oral and written), does Ariel bring to solving the problem? The findings show that initially, Ariel displays his mathematical understanding during his attempt to solve a specific algebraic problem; in this exploration of understanding algebraic ideas, he seeks to identify patterns. We follow his mathematical and language learning from this initial conjecture, to his reformulation and generalization of a rule. Eighteen months later, after studying algebra, Ariel attends to the systems of representation, including both the oral and written expression of the mathematics register. The findings underscore the assertion that students may not be in full command—for production and comprehension—of the mathematics register until they understand the underlying mathematics. Teachers should be encouraged to create situations in which students deploy all of their diverse repertories of mathematics knowledge and skills to the instructional tasks at hand, and to refine their use of the mathematics register.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

They offer thus a compelling suite of materials for technological applications. Their size- and facet-tunable features are studied in synthesis; however, to exploit their features in optoelectronic devices, it will be essential to translate control over size and facets from the colloid all the way to the film. Larger-diameter colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) offer the attractive possibility of harvesting infrared (IR) solar energy beyond absorption of silicon photovoltaics. These CQDs exhibit facets (nonpolar (100)) undisplayed in small-diameter CQDs; and the materials chemistry of smaller nanocrystals fails consequently to translate to materials for the short-wavelength IR regime. A new colloidal management strategy targeting the passivation of both (100) and (111) facets is demonstrated using distinct choices of cations and anions. The approach leads to narrow-bandgap CQDs with impressive colloidal stability and photoluminescence quantum yield. Photophysical studies confirm a reduction both in Stokes shift (≈47 meV) and Urbach tail (≈29 meV).

The initiative gives opportunity and focus for the rethinking and reconfiguration of corporate accountability for human rights. It also presents a threat: the danger, as we see it, is that the Guiding Principles are interpreted and implemented in an uncritical way, on a “humanitarian” model of imposed expertise. The critical and radical democratic communities have tended to be, perhaps rightly, suspicious of rights talk and sceptical of any suggestion that rights and the discourse of human rights can play a progressive role. The purpose of this paper is to explore these issues from a radical perspective. Design/methodology/approach - – This paper uses insights taken from Jacques Ranciere’s work to argue that there is vital critical potential in human rights. There is an obvious negativity to Ranciere’s thought insofar as it conceives of the political as a challenge to the existing social order. The positive dimension to his work, which has its origins in his commitment to and tireless affirmation of the fact of equality, is equally important, if perhaps less obvious. Together the negative and positive moments provide a dynamic conception of human rights and a dialectical view of the relation between human rights and the social order, which enables us to overcome much of the criticism levelled at human rights by certain theorists. Findings - – Ranciere’s conception of the political puts human rights inscriptions, and the traces of equality they carry, at the heart of progressive politics. The authors close the paper with a discussion of the role that accounting for human rights can play in such a democratic politics, and by urging, on that basis, the critical accounting community to cautiously embrace the opportunity presented by the Guiding Principles. Originality/value - – This paper has some novelty in its application of Ranciere’s thinking on political theory to the problems of critical accounting and in particular the critical potential of accounting and human rights. The paper makes a theoretical contribution to a critical understanding of the relationship between accounting, human rights, and democracy.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In modern language, this object is to find a rational point of infinite order on the elliptic curve my2 = x3 - x.

This study looked at online and face-to-face networking behaviour among rural micro-enterprises in Scotland in relation to the development of bonding and bridging social capital. Given the challenges of remoteness faced by many rural businesses, online networking is particularly useful in developing bridging capital, but is an unsuitable context for building the trust needed to gain tangible benefits. The article therefore highlights the importance of face-to-face interactions in developing trust and bonding social capital.

The time series data was collected from the bank’s financial statements and returns to the central bank between 1996 and 2005. It was found that adoption of informal financial product enhanced outreach and sustainability of the bank. This study, demonstrates that the mimicry policy option if adopted by formal financial institutions can enhance availability of financial services to the productive poor and also lead to long-term sustainability of financial institutions.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

All you could see is a crowd of about two hundred people pushing their way towards the same direction as if trying to save themselves from some catastrophe about to happen. Where the heck were all these people trying to go? They were trying to get into one of the most exclusive clubs in town. The only way to get into this place was if you knew someone or if you had money to bribe the doormen. The club catered to the tastes of all people from around the globe. It would not be surprising on any given Saturday night to hear songs from Brazil, Italy, India, France or Lebanon. Their motto was, ""We are all one!"" At around 12 p.m., a man in a beige suit, smoking a cigarette, squeezed his way through to the door. He looked really sharp. There was a beautiful Latin woman holding his left hand as he hugged the doorman with his right arm, as if they were friends forever. He walked through the hallway shaking hands with every employee he saw. His table was waiting for him upstairs next to the Disc Jockey's booth. After greeting everyone he knew, he sat down with his woman awaiting the arrival of his friends, ordered two drinks and lit her cigarette. When the drinks arrived they both stood up and walked over to the edge of the balcony overlooking the huge dance floor swarming with people everywhere. As he kissed his girl, he felt like the luckiest man on the face of the earth. Just a few years later, this same man at one o'clock in the morning on a Saturday night was sitting in the basement of his parent's house screaming to the God who created him, ""Why the f--k am I alive? Tell me or I give up on you and the world!"" I am the man in this story. In this essay I am going to explore the reasons that caused me to have a breakdown that memorable night after battling many months with what I labeled as ""clinical depression."" I will discuss how music not only helped me get over my ""depression,"" but how it actually helped to make it worse. I will also connect my experiences to the ideas and theories of various important sociological figures throughout its history. Let us begin with my life just a few years ago when everything seemed perfect. During that time my friends and I would religiously attend this club called M-80's every Saturday night. We went there so often that absolutely everyone knew us. To be even more precise, I knew everybody in there and introduced them to my friends. The reason I say this in such an arrogant way is because it made me feel very powerful being in the position to know the owners of the various huge clubs in Boston. I felt powerful being able to take care of everyone I knew trying to get inside, even if they were not twenty-one years old yet. Thomas Hobbes's theory that humans desire power certainly rang true during that time. The Disc Jockey was a personal friend of mine. As stated earlier, the music he played at the club came from many different places throughout the globe. Greeks and Italians would sing along and dance to Lebanese and Turkish songs and vice versa. The club was like a second home to all of us. Durkheim would say that we all held some type of a collective consciousness. Collective consciousness can be defined as the ""totality of beliefs and sentiment common to the average members of society,"" (Adams 93) which in turn creates social solidarity or harmony. Most of the patrons were 1st generation born Americans, like myself, struggling with the pursuit of money in a place where everyone is supposedly equal. In the club, we were living this American philosophy. The music united all of us under one roof and under one God! This music transcended into my car and home. As I drove and listened to the tape from the previous Saturday, I would reminisce on some of the highlights of the night and look forward to next week. ""Music is powerful at the level of social groups because it facilitates communication which goes beyond words, induces shared emotional reactions and supports the development of group identity"" (DeNora, 51). …","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Whilst occasional churchgoers are found to sit more loosely to formulations of Christian affiliation, both groups are equally strongly attracted by traditional language and hymns.

Animal research suggests that premature auditory stimulation interrupts auditory development. Because mice are born before their auditory systems are developed, they make an excellent model for research on fetal and postnatal plasticity of the auditory system. The premature auditory state of newborn mice is similar to that of the NICU pre-term infant, albeit, natural for mice C57 mouse pups were exposed to an augmented acoustic environment (AAE) of a nightly 12-hour regiment of 70 dB SPL noise burst, beginning before age 12 days (onset of hearing) and lasting for one month. The prepulse inhibition (PPI) of mice exposed to the AAE was compared to that of non-exposed mice to observe short-term and long-term effects.

The purpose of this study was to identify consumer characteristics that are related to the clothing design preferences of non-Caucasian working women as they have the potential to become a valuable target market. The final sample included non-Caucasian working women who wear business jackets to work at least once a week. Although the study did not find significant differences in design preferences affected by ethnicity, the findings displayed the importance of consumer characteristics on design preference formations for the selected minority groups. The results showed a relatively high preference for a loosely fitted, bust and waist deep neckline jacket style by older respondents. Respondents who work in a larger department with more colleagues preferred a loosely fitted, hip length, waist deep neckline style. Larger consumers displayed a relatively high preference for a semi-fitted, short length, above bust neckline, and a notched collar jacket style. Taller consumers preferred a tunic level, fitted, bust deep neckline, and rounded collar jacket style. Introduction In the foreseeable future, according to the figures in the 2002 U.S. Census Bureau, African, Asian, and Hispanic Americans will accumulate substantial disposable income that will result in increased purchasing power. A report by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia (as cited in Gardyn & Fetto, 2003) also demonstrated that in 2002 the buying power of African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans reached $646 billion, $581 billion, and $296 billion respectively. The same source predicts that the ethnic consumers’ share in the marketplace will continue to increase and in 2007 the disposable income of Hispanic Americans will total $927 billion and the disposable income of African-Americans will total $853 billion. In addition, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics claims that in 2002 females accounted for 43% of the full-time work force and 66 % of the part-time work force. The statistics imply that working women have accrued significant revenue leading to increased importance of women as consumers. Women of ethnic backgrounds make for an important part of the total female work force. In the previous years, several reports (Chang, 2001; Khan, Chawla, & Devine, 1996; O’Neal, 1998a) indicated that African, Asian, and Hispanic American working women represent a lucrative niche for apparel manufacturers. However, prevailing fashion and styles are in accordance with the physical characteristics and design preferences of American women of European origin, not necessarily the ones with various ethnic origins (O’Neal, 1998a). With this in mind, the purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of personal, physical, psychosocial, and job-related characteristics of African, Asian, and Hispanic-American working women on their apparel design preferences. Literature Review The higher growth rate of these three ethnic groups, as compared to the growth rate of the Caucasian-American population, would result in increased ethnic and racial diversity in the emerging workforce. In addition, higher educational attainment of women and economic necessity will provide women of varying ethnic backgrounds with more career opportunities (Chang, 2001; Khan, Chawla, & Devine, 1996). According to a report by Cotton Inc. (as cited in “African American,” 2001), 28% of African-American women and 14% of Hispanic-American women spent more than $200 a month on clothing as compared to 12% of Caucasian women. According to the same report, 24% of Hispanic women and 19% of African-American women purchased clothes in the price range of $101-$200 a month, whereas only 15% of Caucasian women spent the same amount of money per month. A survey done by Simmons Market Research Bureau (as cited in “Feho, Whelan, & Yin,” 2001) showed that 38% of Asian women, 36% of young African-American women, and 32% of Hispanic women are “fashion conscious” as compared to 29% of Caucasian women. Another study by the Simmons Market Research Bureau in the first half of 2002 (as cited in Gardyn & Fetto, 2003) stated that 58% of African-Americans, 46% of Hispanic-Americans, and 46% of Asian-Americans like to dress in the latest fashion compared to only 36% of Caucasians. The reported statistics indicate that, for apparel manufacturers, non-Caucasian working women are worth targeting. However, these particular consumer groups display major physical differences from Caucasian-American women. More over, design preferences of African, Asian, and Hispanic-American women slightly vary in accordance with their historic and ethnic heritage (Yoo, 2003). African-American Women African-American aesthetics of dress includes individual expression, the tendency to dress up, as well as partiality for bold colors of high visual impact (O’Neal, 1998a). As a result of the distinct African-American cultural background, African-Americans use dress as a display of emotional and symbolic messages as well as solidarity and group belonging (Daniels, 2002; O’Neal, 1998a). However, African-American women are influenced by the standards of beauty imposed by the dominant fashion industry and exhibit high preference for trendy clothes (Gardyn & Fetto, 2003). The 2002 Simmons Market Research Study (as cited in Gardyn & Fetto) showed that keeping up with the latest trends in fashion is important for 34% of African-Americans as compared to 28% of Asian-Americans, 27% of Hispanics, and 25% of Caucasians. Once appropriated, however, trendy clothes are personalized and modified to express individual style and preferences (O’Neal, 1998a, O’Neal, 1998b). Hamilton (1999) points out that empirical research has overlooked the central role the physical body had played in defining the African-American aesthetics. She claims that sensuality and worship of the body were expressed through cultural artifacts such as clothing.","[{""country"":[""Africa"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data"",""Sensor Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The primary task of ERP systems is to achieve the before-mentioned objectives. Objective: The selection of a particular ERP system has a decisive effect on the future operation and profitability of the enterprise. The qualitative correlation between the size of enterprises, market position, etc. and the applied selection criteria for ERP systems should be analysed as to whether which criteria are used at multinational enterprises or at SMEs. Methods/Approach: Our research is grounded in a literature review and case studies of everyday practice related to the introduction, implementation and roll-out of ERP systems. Results: The dominant critical success factor of ERP introduction seems to be “ERP software suitability”, “Information quality”, “ERP vendor quality”. Conclusion: The set of criteria on one hand shows strong correlation with non-functional requirements codified in standards, and on the other hand with usual functional requirements for ERP systems.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The major metabolic pathway of dexmedetomidine [(+)-4-(S)-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole] in humans is N-glucuronidation at the imidazolate nitrogens. We have purified the N3- and N1-glucuronides of dexmedetomidine, termed DG1 and DG2, respectively, according to their elution order in liquid chromatography and determined their structure by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Studying medetomidine glucuronidation by human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A4 indicated that another human UGT plays a major role in these activities. We now demonstrate that this enzyme is UGT2B10. HLMs catalyzed DG1 and DG2 formation, at a ratio of 3:1, with two-enzyme kinetics that contain both a high-affinity component, K(m1) values of 6.6 and 8.7 microM, and a low-affinity component, K(m2) values > 1 mM. The DG1/DG2 ratio in the case of UGT2B10 was lower, 1.4:1, whereas the substrate affinity for both reactions was high, K(m) values of 11 and 16 microM. UGT1A4 produced mainly DG1 (DG1/DG2 ratio of 6.6:1) at low substrate affinities, K(m) values above 0.6 mM, but superior expression-normalized V(max) values. Levomedetomidine [(-)-4-(R)-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole] glucuronidation by HLMs yielded mostly the N3-glucuronide (LG1, structure determined by NMR), with monophasic kinetics and a K(m) value of 14 microM. The activity of UGT1A4 toward levomedetomide was low and generated both LG1 and LG2, whereas UGT2B10 exhibited relatively high activity and sharp regioselectivity, yielding only LG1, with a K(m) value of 7.4 microM. The results highlight the contribution of UGT2B10 to medetomidine glucuronidation and its potential importance for other N-glucuronidation reactions within the human liver.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

They meet the challenge of adapting the American way of life in different ways: passive acceptance of the new home country, the strongest attachment to what they left behind, or the swinging between the two. This speaks of the ambiguous relationship between ‘East’ and ‘West’, between ‘utopia’ and ‘dystopia’, and of the dialogue between different worldviews. The representations of both utopian and dystopian dimensions significantly contribute to construct the characters' psychology. Their visions of the world, embodying their aspirations and their fears, their feeling of well-being or unease, are not permanent and fixed but shaped by interests and are thus changeable. This transformation of perspective also informs the inner structure of the novel that is built on a bipolar framework where utopia and dystopia alternate and merge: a world initially considered to be good turns out to be bad, and the other way round. Thus, the clear-cut dichotomized vision of the world turns out to be only the projection of aspirations and hopes and an imaginary portrait that corresponds more to stereotypes and preconceived ideas than to reality.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Therefore, optimising students’ learning processes is a central goal of professional development at the university level. Learning processes are influenced by an individual’s prior knowledge, beliefs, and expectations. Having insights into the beliefs and expectations of our students should give us the opportunity to optimize their university courses. To obtain a better understanding of these beliefs and expectations we used a questionnaire with open questions. All statements of feedback from 168 students in BA/MA programmes were categorised. For this purpose, we developed a category system based on the COACTIV model of professional competence. The results indicated that many students assume that the most important influence on their future profession is the possession of self-related ability cognitions, but they do not expect to develop such cognitions in their university courses. As a consequence of these findings, the Division of Chemistry Education has begun offering students authentic learning situations with real pupils. This approach offers the chance for the students to try out the teacher role and to reflect upon the first teaching experiences. They can revise their image of the teachers’ role and acquire a realistic view of their future profession.","[{""country"":[""Norway""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Conventionally, human geography research has avoided engagement with such emotions. Although the ideal of the detached observer has been roundly critiqued, the emphasis in methodological literature on ‘doing no harm’ has led even qualitative researchers to avoid difficult emotional encounters. Nonetheless, research is inevitably shaped by emotions, not least those of the researchers themselves.

We review selected research from around the world and we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of deficit irrigation. Research results confirm that DI is successful in increasing water productivity for various crops without causing severe yield reductions. Nevertheless, a certain minimum amount of seasonal moisture must be guaranteed.

Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were subjected to transplantation of 1 × 106 of either ob/ob or wild-type-derived NKT lymphocytes, or to transplantation of either ob/ob or wild-type-derived splenocytes. The effect on hepatic fat content was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (signal intensity index) and histology, using the steatohepatitis grading scale. The degree of glucose intolerance was measured by an oral glucose tolerance test (GTT). Adoptive transfer of wild-type or ob/ob-derived regulatory NKT cells led to a 12% decrease in hepatic fat content. A significant histological shift from macrosteatosis to microsteatosis was observed. Marked improvement in the GTT was noted in wild-type or ob/ob-derived NKT recipients. Metabolic effects were associated with a significant decrease in peripheral and intrahepatic CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratios. Intrahepatic CD8 trapping was observed in all responders. Serum interleukin 10 levels decreased significantly. In conclusion, adoptive transfer of a relatively small number of regulatory NKT lymphocytes into ob/ob mice results in a significant reduction in hepatic fat content, a shift from macro to microsteatosis, and significant improvement in glucose intolerance. These effects were associated with decreased peripheral and intrahepatic CD4/CD8 ratios and decreased interleukin 10 levels. The results further support a role for regulatory NKT lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the leptin-deficient murine model.

According to Catholic social teaching, by contrast, these unities of order - such as church and family, as well as corporations and schools and the like - are, at least in potency, ontologically prior to the state. Such group persons both constitute conditions of the possibility of human flourishing and, correlatively, impose limitations on the ""sovereign"" state. Such group persons are not mere concessions of an unbounded state: They are ontological realities that must be recognized by the state and, as necessary or apt, regulated or assisted according to the principle of subsidiarity, properly understood. This Article studies how the current failure in the United States to respect both the reality of group persons and the proper application to them of the principle of subsidiarity frustrates the work of families and churches in the concrete conditions of America today. In particular, the Article demonstrates how the Lasallian order, which for centuries has served the poor through education, has lost its ability to continue that work in the U.S. today. Law and policy shaped by respect for group persons and the principle of subsidiarity could, without violating the Establishment Clause as currently authoritatively interpreted, come to the rescue of family, church, and poor children. Catholic social doctrine points toward a limited state that serves not just individuals, including individuals in poverty, but the societies in which individuals reach the ontological perfections of which they are capable.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The analysis of the measured traces reveals energy-dependent time delays of a few tens of attoseconds with high energy resolution. In contrast to photoelectrons ejected through tunneling, single-photon ionization can be well described in the framework of Wigner time delays. Accordingly, the overall trend of our data is reproduced by recent Wigner time delay calculations. However, besides the general trend we observe resonance features occurring at specific photon energies. These features have been qualitatively reproduced and identified by a calculation using the multiconfigurational Hartree-Fock method, including the influence of doubly excited states and ionization thresholds.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Setting and Participants: Single center study of prevalent kidney transplant recipients from a transplant clinic in a large academic center. Intervention: Assessment of cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic and clinical variables associated with cognitive impairment were also examined. Outcomes and Measurements: a) Prevalence of cognitive impairment defined by a MoCA score of <26. b) Multivariable linear and logistic regression to examine the association of demographic and clinical factors with cognitive impairment. Data from 226 patients were analyzed. Mean (SD) age was 54 (13.4) years, 73% were white, 60% were male, 37% had diabetes, 58% had an education level of college or above, and the mean (SD) time since kidney transplant was 3.4 (4.1) years. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 58.0%. Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that older age, male gender and absence of diabetes were associated with lower MoCA scores (p < 0.01 for all). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not associated with level of cognition. The logistic regression analysis confirmed the association of older age with cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment is common in prevalent kidney transplant recipients, at a younger age compared to general population, and is associated with certain demographic variables, but not level of eGFR.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This book deals with the need for further clarification of how students learn in higher education in the 21st century and to what extent the measurements often used in learning pattern studies are still up to date or can be advanced with present methodological and statistical insights to capture the most important differences and changes in student learning. ::: ::: The contributions in the book are organized in two parts: a first conceptual and psychological part in which the dimensions of student learning in the 21st century are discussed and a second empirical part in which questions related to how students’ learning can be measured and how it develops are considered. ::: ::: Areas covered include: ::: ::: ::: •Cultural influences on learning patterns ::: ::: •Predicting learning outcomes ::: ::: •Student centred learning environments and self-directed learning ::: ::: •Mathematics learning ::: ::: This indispensable book covers multiple conceptual perspectives on how learning patterns can be described and effects and developments can be measured, and will not only be helpful for ‘learning researchers’ as such but also for educational researchers from the broad domain of educational psychology, motivation psychology and instructional sciences, who are interested in student motivation, self-regulated learning, effectiveness of innovative learning environments, as well as assessment and evaluation of student characteristics and learning process variables.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In addition, more and more experts in the mutations and diseases of particular genes are curating published and unpublished mutations in locus-specific databases (LSDB). These databases contain such extensive information that they have become known as knowledge bases. We analyzed these databases and their content between June 21, 2001, and July 18, 2001. We were able to access 94 independent websites devoted to the documentation of mutation containing 262 LSDBs for study. We analyzed one LSDB from each of these websites (i.e., 94 LSDBs) for the presence or absence of 80 content criteria, as generally each gene in a multigene website documented the same criteria. No criterion studied gave unanimous agreement in every database. Twenty-two genes were represented by more than one LSDB. The number of mutations recorded, excluding p53, was 23,822 with 1518 polymorphisms. Fifty-four percent of the LSDBs studied were easy to use and 11% hard to follow; 73% of the databases were displayed through HTML. Three databases were found that were given a high score for ease of use and wealth of content. Thus, the study provided a strong case for uniformity of data to make the content maximally useful. In this direction, a hypothetical content for an ideal LSDB was derived. We also derived a community structure that would enhance the chances of mutation capture rather than being left unpublished in a patient's report. We hope the interested community and granting bodies will assist in achieving the vision of a public system that collects and displays all variants discovered.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Cost of completion also tends to be superior if the event (low market value/high cost) leading to the breach is very likely, because then the existence of the contract itself indicates substantial idiosyncratic value.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Whistleblowing could be understood as anything related to the disclosure of violation of rules and regulations, law or violation of any safety regulation leading to hazardous consequences by any person known or unknown to the organization, it could also mean disclosing any practice by the individual which could malign the reputation of the organization and in turn is unfavorable for the company's financial interests. This paper gives arguments discussing about the significance of whistleblower's protection law for India giving examples of negative retaliation and reprisals faced by the whistleblowers of India.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIMB 8628 was also co-cultured with C. difficile and studied. The results indicated inhibition of C. difficile by the probiotics. The inhibition of C. difficile was shown to be pH-dependent using neutralized and unmodified cell free supernatant (CFS) produced by the probiotic strains. However, concentrated CFS of the probiotics also inhibited the intestinal pathogen in a non pH-dependent manner, likely due to specific antimicrobial substances produced. The results also indicated that C. difficile growth was greatly influenced by the presence of sodium taurocholate and by the pH of the medium. A medium pH of between 6.45 and 6.9 demonstrated maximum growth of the organism in the microcalorimeter.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Most important advantages of this are new technology, management ability, marketing ability and modern know-how. However, the literature dealing specifically with the issue of German direct investments in Turkey is fairly sparse. Regarding this, the purpose of study is not only to explore the main determinants of German FDI inflows in Turkey, but also to increase our understanding of the relationship between FDI and its determinants. The conceptual framework used in this study was firstly designed by Dunning and became known as ""The eclectic paradigm of international production"". The results of a literature review about the German direct investments made in Turkey and the determinants of FDI related to the market entry are shown in the text. Portfolio investments as well as foreign debt are ignored. When considering market policy, there are numbers of investment motives that are critical for German companies, i.e. management potential and popularity. The entrepreneurs believe in ""market potential, dynamics, growth"", existing ""High-and lows-killed"" workers and ""Political and economic stability"" in Turkey. From the characterization of German direct investments, it is possible to conclude that the transfer of factors that influence competitiveness of German companies is major priority of companies positioned in Turkey. According to survey results, in majority of cases most advanced technology was transferred to Turkey.","[{""country"":[""Germany""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data"",""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

This work combination can be problematic, since journalists and PR practitioners have different responsibilities. Working as a journalist entails contributing to the public duties of journalism such as informing the public, offering multiple viewpoints, and representing societal interests; in contrast, PR practitioners must advocate solely in their clients’ interests. Conflicts can arise between these two roles if a freelance journalist is, for instance, required to critically investigate his or her PR client. However, there has been little research on freelance journalists with secondary work in PR. This study seeks to address this gap in research; therefore, we conducted a quantitative online survey among German “PR-journalists”. Our results show that nearly half of the participants take on secondary PR work for financial reasons; however, a similar number of journalists take on PR-work voluntarily, as they find the work interesting and enjoyable. Moreover, participants described their professional identity very similarly to that of German journalists in general. The PR-journalists surveyed were aware of the potential for conflicts of interest arising from their dual role.

Data on precut tissues from Nov 2012 to Dec 2014 were retrospectively reviewed from the electronic database of the eye bank of a tertiary eye care center in South India. Donor characteristic data including donor age, precut and postcut endothelial cell density (ECD), recipient age, and thickness of graft were collected. The number of precuts increased from 42 in 2012 (Nov and Dec) and 422 in 2013 to 584 in 2014. Of the total of 1048 precuts, seven (0.67 %) were miscut and could not be utilized for transplants. The donor age ranged from 2 to 89 years. A mean change of 43.6 ± 325.2 cells/mm2 in ECD was noted after cut, proportional increase in mean being 1.9 %. The change in ECD after cut was negatively correlated with ECD before cut. The recipient age ranged from 1 to 89 years. The median thickness of donor lenticule after cut was 148 µm (interquartile range 131-166 µm). Analysis of precut donor corneas from a single eye bank shows that the ECD of the processed tissues was excellent for transplantation. The tissue wastage in the hands of eye bank personal was minimal.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

While ""jealousy"" is an acceptable translation in the human sphere, Amzallag claims that in the divine sphere these words refer to furnace remelting, signaling that Israel's God was viewed as a smelting deity. There are several problems with Amzallag's argument. By paying closer attention to linguistic evidence and methodological considerations, one finds that in both human and divine contexts words from the root [inline-graphic 01] are best understood with the traditional translation ""jealousy,"" an emotion closely related to anger, rather than the elaborate metallurgical imagery that Amzallag proposes.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

My reading of Undoing Gender will illustrate reflective moments in which Butler herself describes spaces outside of intelligibility. First, my analysis will consist of in reading Butlers earlier work against her more recent writings on gender. Utilizing the same critical lens that Butler incorporated to compare Foucault’s later work against his earlier writing will bring to the fore important tensions in Bulter’s gender theory and her relationship with Foucault. Second, I will describe the discourse of the scalpel that is found in the narratives of both Barbin and David. I find that Barbin’s framework foreshadows the discourse of the scalpel that Judith Bulter identifies within the life story of David Reimer. Then I will give an account of the discourse of the scalpel as a form of biopower. I will supplement my analysis of Bulter with Jemima Repo’s essay, Herculine Barbin and the Omission of Biopolitics from Judith Butler’s Gender Genealogy. Taken together my analysis will elucidate a lineage between Herculine Barbin and David Reimer that calls for a reexamination of Butler’s relationship with Foucault. The conditions of intelligibility from which we emerge and are recognized as human, are composed of a set of complex and culturally situated norms. These norms are preconditions of what it means to be socially and legally recognized as human. To fall outside of societal norms is impermissible, dangerous and even criminal. Those who fall outside of sexual norms and categories of gender are particularly susceptible to numerous forms of violence. This violence is manifest in the discrimination that sexual and gender minorities face at the hands of their peers, the law, the psychiatrist’s couch, and the surgeon’s scalpel. Two exemplary cases of individuals who gave personal accounts of the violence of over-determination are Herculine Barbin and David Reimer. While these two cases are not the same (Herculine was an intersex person who lived in 19 century France and David was a biological male born in the late 20 century who after a botched circumcision was raised as girl.) They serve as important points of Res Cogitans (2014) 5 Laybourn-Candlish | 129 2155-4838 | commons.pacificu.edu/rescogitans reference and departure for understanding the processes of over-determination to which bodies are susceptible. In this essay I will make a comparative analysis of Butler’s reading of Herculine Barbin in Gender Trouble and David Reimer in Undoing Gender. I will concentrate on passages in Gender Trouble in which Butler critiques Foucault’s reading of Herculine Barbin’s memoir, particularly his description of the “happy limbo of non-identity” My reading of Undoing Gender will illustrate reflective moments in which Butler herself describes spaces outside of intelligibility. First, I will give a description of bio-power. Second, I will describe the “discourse of the scalpel” that is found in the narratives of both Barbin and David. I find that Barbin’s framework foreshadows the discourse of the scalpel that Judith Butler identifies within the life story of David Reimer because of the advent of bio-power. Finally, my analysis will consist of reading Butler’s earlier work against her more recent writings on gender concentrating on her work on David Reimer. Utilizing the same critical lens that Butler employed in her writing comparing Foucault’s later work against his earlier writing will bring to the fore important tensions in Butler’s own gender theory and her relationship to Foucault. My analysis will elucidate a lineage between Herculine Barbin and David Reimer that calls for a reexamination of Butler’s relationship with Foucault, which will open new potential for notions of intelligibility. Bio-power surfaced as a dominant paradigm in the nineteenth century. Bio-power designates what “brought to life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made knowledge power an agent of transformation of human life” (Foucault 143). In the eighteenth century, bodies freely made a display of themselves, enjoying a sexual candor that ended when the Victorians began to constrict and regulate sex. Our will to know, to uncover and demystify sex, has led us to construct and accept a science of sexuality. This will to know is inherent to bio-power. According to Foucault, “The agencies of power are determined to speak about it, to hear it spoken about, and to cause it to speak through explicit articulation and endlessly accumulated detail” (Foucault 18). In other words mechanisms in the areas of religion, psychoanalysis economics, pedagogy, medicine and law “incite, extract, distribute, and internalize sexual verbosity” (Kurzweil 219). It was through this incitement to discourse that the sciences of sex took charge of sex. At the same time sex was made inappropriate to speak of, and confined to the bedroom or the confessional, experts began to freely and openly discuss it. The presence of sex in discourse became ever more prevalent as the power over it increased, leading new sites of sexual pleasure to emerge from the very regimes that sought to control it (Kurzweil 219). The more people constructed means to restrict sex, the more sex became the topic of discussion and subject of inquiry. The secrets of sex were laid bare as they became medically and legally exposed. Perversion became codified; observations in hospitals, prisons, schools and homes regulated the boundaries of Res Cogitans (2014) 5 Laybourn-Candlish | 13","[{""country"":[""France""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A two-stage probit model results revealed a negative reciprocal relationship between fertilizer use and manure applications, basically because of the difference in additional resource requirements for application of the two inputs. Whereas prices of chemical fertilizers are very high in the study area, manure is labor-intensive in its application. This implies that the ability to afford high fertilizer prices decreases the probability to apply manure; and endowment with adequate labor input decreases the probability to opt for fertilizer. The study also identified different impediments to adoption of fertilizer use and manure applications and important implications drawn from the results are discussed.","[{""country"":[""Ethiopia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In the present study, we used random-dot patterns to study the effects of aging on speed-tuning curves in cortical area MT of macaque visual cortex. Our results provide evidence for a significant degradation of speed selectivity in MT. Cells in old animals preferred lower speeds than did those in young animals. Response modulation and discriminative capacity for speed in old monkeys were also significantly weaker than those in young ones. Concurrently, MT cells in old monkeys showed increased baseline responses, peak responses and response variability, and these changes were accompanied by decreased signal-to-noise ratios. We also found that speed discrimination thresholds in old animals were higher than in young ones. The foregoing neural changes may mediate the declines in visual motion perception that occur during senescence.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The proposed new vision is “to reduce poverty and hunger, improve human health and nutrition, and enhance ecosystem resilience through high‐quality international agricultural research, partnership and leadership.” The CGIAR’s key objectives are to create and accelerate sustainable increases in the productivity and production of healthy food by and for the poor; conserve, enhance and sustainably use natural resources and biodiversity to improve the livelihoods of the poor in response to climate change and other factors; and promote policy and institutional change that will stimulate agricultural growth and equity to benefit the poor, especially rural women and other disadvantaged groups.The CGIAR has a distinguished history of success in these endeavors, successes in which the social sciences have historically played a prominent role. But there is a widespread sense of discontent with the present state of the social sciences within the CGIAR, some of which may reflect broader concerns about the CGIAR in general, and some of which may be specific to the social sciences within the System. As a direct result, the Science Council of the CGIAR has commissioned a stripe review of the social sciences in the CGIAR. The current global food and fuel price crisis accentuates the need for a reinvigorated CGIAR to help reverse the structural problems in global agriculture that have emerged over the past several years.Per the terms of reference for phase 1 of the stripe review, the panel Chair was tasked to develop, in consultation with the SC Task Force, a normative framework for a high quality and effective social science research agenda, which, if operationalized, would advance research on the CGIAR System Priorities and effectively contribute to achieving the CGIAR goals. The framework represents an “ideal” of what the CGIAR should expect from its social scientists against which the Panel can assess the actual situation.” This paper is the product of that effort. It builds on a descriptive assessment desk study undertaken by a consultant, and feeds into the draft terms of references for phase 2 of the stripe review. Together, these three documents comprise the outputs of phase 1 of the review.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A claim is considered to be terminated when the claimant returns to work. Data used in the analysis were provided by the Life and Risk Committee of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia. Initial analysis of the data suggests the presence of a long-run probability, of the order of 7%, that a claimant will never return to work. This phenomenon suggests the use of mixed parametric regression models as a description of claim duration which include the prediction of a long-run probability of not returning to work. A series of such parametric mixture models was investigated, and it was found that the generalised F mixture distribution provided a good fit to the data and also highlighted the impact of a number of statistically significant predictors of claim duration.","[{""country"":[""Australia""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Disabled women in India face multiple discrimination: social exclusion, lack of autonomy with regard to their SRH, vulnerability to violence, and lack of access to SRH care. While they may face shared challenges, an intersectional perspective suggests that considering disabled women as a uniform and ‘vulnerable’ group is likely to mask multiple differences in their lived experiences.Objective: To explore commonality and heterogeneity in the experiences of disabled women in relation to their SRH needs and rights in Gujarat State, India.Methods: We conducted 22 in-depth qualitative interviews with women between the ages of 18 and 49 with any form of self-identified disability.

The present study investigated whether administration of alamandine to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) modulates blood pressure and sympathetic activity. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were recorded in anaesthetized rats. PVN microinjection of alamandine increased MAP and RSNA both in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), but to a greater extent in SHRs. Moreover, these effects were blocked by pretreatment with alamandine receptor Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor, member D (MrgD) antagonist D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7), adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor SQ22536, and protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor rp-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothionate (Rp-cAMP). Treatment with D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7), SQ22536, or Rp-cAMP alone in PVN decreased MAP and RSNA in the SHRs. Conversely cAMP alone increased MAP and RSNA, and pretreatment with cAMP enhanced alamandine's effects. These results indicate that microinjection of alamandine into the PVN increases blood pressure and sympathetic outflow via MrgD and the cAMP-PKA pathway.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is a tendency of great contemporary crises that their effects reach beyond national borders, that they expand from one social field to another, and that they connect with existing social problems which are then further exacerbated. The changing dimensions of modern crises have a direct influence on crisis management. Its conventional organization and co-ordination forms are no longer adequate, a rethinking of politics and the capacity of crisis response is needed that takes both the national and international levels of the problem into account. The stated characteristics of a crisis and crisis management are also a concern of Slovenia, which has relatively well-developed crisis management within individual governmental agencies but has not yet established the appropriate coordination between them, i.e. on the national, strategic level. The article comprises a brief theoretical introduction to crisis and crisis management, followed by the results of an analysis of the legal structure regulating this field in Slovenia. It also offers subjective viewpoints of senior state officials on crisis management, selected functional aspects of crisis management, and final conclusions.

Evidence from the Emergency Department","Understanding potential ways through which physicians impact each other's performance can yield new insights into better management of hospitals' operations. We use evidence from Emergency Medicine to study whether and how physicians who work alongside each other during same shifts affect each other's performance. We find strong empirical evidence that physicians affect each other's speed and quality, and scheduling diverse peers during the same shift could have a positive net impact on the operations of a hospital Emergency Department (ED). Specifically, our results show that a faster (slower) peer decreases (increases) the average speed of a focal physician compared to a same-speed peer. Similarly, a higher- (lower-) quality peer decreases (increases) a focal physician's average quality. Furthermore, the presence of a less-experienced peer improves a focal physician's average speed. However, in contrast to the conventional wisdom, we do not find any evidence that more-experienced physicians can affect the performance of their less-experienced peers. We investigate various mechanisms that might be the driving force behind our findings, including psychological channels such as learning, social influence, and homophily as well as resource spillover. We identify resource spillover as the main driver of the effects we observe and show that, under high ED volumes (i.e., when the shared resources are most constrained), the magnitude of the observed effects increases. While some of these observed effects tend to be long-lived, we find that their magnitudes are fairly heterogeneous among physicians. In particular, our results show that newly-hired and/or high-performing physicians are typically more influenced than others by their peers. Finally, we draw conclusions from our results and discuss how they can be utilized by hospital administrators to improve the overall performance of physicians via better scheduling patterns and/or training programs that require physicians to work during same shifts.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

A main reason for this is the fact that a CGE model can often capture many of the complex interactions between different types of taxes, and their effects upon different sectors, agents, or regions in an economy. These interactions are difficult and sometimes impossible to be analysed adequately in a simple analytical model. In this course, students will have a chance to get familiar with the basic concepts and theories used in the construction of a computable general equilibrium model – also known as applied general equilibrium (AGE) model, and then use this framework to analyse the impacts of some important taxes in an economy such as environmental tax or goods and services tax. We will look first at the issue of interactions (or trade-off) between different types of taxes given a particular level of taxation, and then look at the issue of optimal level of taxation which gives rise to the concept of marginal cost of public funds. The interaction between different types of taxes is often known in the public finance literature as the ‘second best’ problem, and this type of problem is best analysed within a CGE model because of its complex nature.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The majority of such injuries can be managed using percutaneous reduction techniques, and the posterior ring can be stabilized using percutaneous transiliac–transsacral screw fixation. However, a subgroup of patients present with inadequate bony corridors, significant sacral zone 2 comminution or significant lateral/vertical displacement of the hemipelvis through a complete sacral fracture. Percutaneous strategies in such circumstances can be dangerous. Those patients may benefit from prone positioning and open reduction of the sacral fracture with fixation through tension band plating or lumbo-pelvic fixation. Soft tissue handling is critical, and direct reduction techniques around the sacrum can be difficult due to the complex anatomy and the fragile nature of the sacrum making clamp placement and tightening a challenge. In this paper, we propose a mini-invasive technique of indirect reduction and temporary stabilization, which is soft tissue friendly and permits maintenance of reduction during definitive fixation surgical.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

These firms have experienced significant growth in Italy, partly as a result of public contributions. The objective of the research is to analyze the management of biogas plant firms by analyzing annual accounts as the main document of use to third parties for the evaluation of a firm’s management. The research, conducted on a sample of 22 firms using 110 year-data, has highlighted that economic and financial margins are different, though often statistically correlated. The research shows that profitability and cash generation in the biogas plant industry are high, even if the generation of cash flow is less than the return on equity, and there are firm cases of having difficulty in financial debt repayment, even in the presence of positive economic margins. The research also shows that return on equity greatly exceeds the performance of Italian government bonds and of the majority of industrial sectors; this result points to the significant increase in returns on equity capital in the industry, potentially damaging other sectors, and highlighting the risk of the distortive use of public resources.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to explore the bankers’ perception based on the advantages of electronic banking and the risks that are associated with electronic banking. Secondly, to explore banker’s perception on the risk management principles of e-banking according to the 14 principles of Basel Committee in Cyprus. The main research instrument is a questionnaire. Multinomial regressions and other statistical tools are applied in this paper. Our findings suggest that most of the respondents, who are bankers in Cyprus, perceive e-banking as an advantage for reducing the risk of carrying cash, for the time saving and convenience. Surprisingly, the bankers do not consider that e-banking increases frauds and issues on data loss, and do not increase the chances of government access. Furthermore, our results indicate that the four major public banks in Cyprus identify risks and manage them according to the 14 principles of Basel Committee. Finally, a significant link between both the years of experience of banker and the position held in the banks; and the security control as one of the 14 principles of Basel Committee has been identified applying multinomial regression model. The results can strongly support the management team of each bank for the development of a more efficient strategy for the future of e-banking in Cyprus.","[{""country"":[""Cyprus""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the first-year radiographic progression rates between a treat-to-target (T2T) strategy with initial combination therapy (strategy II) versus an initial step-up monotherapy (strategy I). Methods A total of 128 patients from strategy II was individually matched with 128 patients from strategy I on sex, age (± 5 yrs.) and baseline disease activity (± 0.5 on the DAS28). Differences in radiographic progression scores and the number of patients experiencing a minimal clinically important difference (≥5 SHS points; MCID) between both strategies were tested with Mann Whitney U test and chi-square test. Next, linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine which baseline variables were associated with radiographic progression scores and the probability of experiencing an MCID within 1 year. Results Patients with initial combination therapy had slightly higher baseline disease activity scores and pain scores, but better mental health scores. Patients with initial monotherapy had significantly more, and more frequently clinically relevant, radiographic progression after one year. Experiencing a MCID was associated with fewer tender joints (p=0.05) and higher ESR (p=0.02) at baseline. Figure. No caption available. Conclusions Excellent radiographic outcome was achieved for patients treated according to a protocolled T2T strategy in daily clinical practice. Patients treated with initial monotherapy had significantly more short-term radiographic progression than patients treated with initial combination therapy.

Recruitment took place at four Victorian healthcare settings during 2001 and 2002. A total of 431 participants completed the CSAAQ following an appointment or hospital discharge. Factor analyses performed on CSAAQ items demonstrated there were three factors (urinary incontinence symptoms, faecal incontinence symptoms, lifestyle adjustment behaviours) for both women and men. The urinary and faecal items that loaded on their respective factors were different for women and men. Consequently two versions of the CSAAQ were developed; one for males and one for females. Analyses supported the construct validity and internal consistency reliability of the gender specific questionnaires. The brief gender specific CSAAQs could be produced as a single questionnaire with separate sections for female and male specific items. The brief CSAAQs are suitable for use as an incontinence self-assessment questionnaire to increase awareness of individual incontinence issues and to encourage health-seeking behaviours.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Most current mitigation approaches rely upon the fingerprint liveness detection as the main anti-spoofing mechanisms. However, liveness detection algorithms are not robust to sensor variations. In other words, typical liveness detection algorithms need to be retrained and adapted to each and every sensor used for fingerprint capture. In this paper, inspired by popular invariant feature descriptors such as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), we propose a new invariant descriptor of fingerprint ridge texture called histograms of invariant gradients (HIG). The proposed descriptor is designed to preserve robustness to variations in gradient positions. Spoofed fingerprints are detected using multiple histograms of invariant gradients computed from spatial neighborhoods within the fingerprint. Results show that proposed method achieves an average accuracy comparable to the best algorithms of the Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2013, while being applicable with no change to multiple acquisition sensors.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

These people also include persons that take occupation of places/settlements 'illegally', although they are not expected to resort to illegal means in exercising their right. Due to a lack of access to housing people often erect shacks or other structures on land for which they do not have legal occupation. Such persons occupy lands belonging to private persons or entities, government and local municipalities. As a result, South Africa continues to witness cases and incidents of forced evictions whereby persons who are in illegal occupation of land are forcefully removed from it.

At least half of the RTKs have been reported to be cleaved by gamma-secretase-mediated regulated intramembrane proteolysis. The two-step process involves releasing the RTK ectodomain to the extracellular space by proteolytic cleavage called shedding, followed by cleavage in the RTK transmembrane domain by the gamma-secretase complex resulting in release of a soluble RTK intracellular domain. This intracellular domain, including the tyrosine kinase domain, can in turn translocate to various cellular compartments, such as the nucleus or proteasome. The soluble intracellular domain may interact with transcriptional regulators and other proteins to induce specific effects on cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, establishing an additional signaling mode for the cleavable RTKs. On the other hand, the same process can facilitate RTK turnover and proteasomal degradation. In this review we focus on the regulation of RTK shedding and gamma-secretase cleavage, as well as signaling promoted by the soluble RTK ICDs. In addition, therapeutic implications of increased knowledge on RTK cleavage on cancer drug development are discussed.","[{""country"":[""Finland""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Prior probabilities are designed only for overlapping spectral signatures. Accordingly, their effect on an individual class is independent of the classes that are spectrally separable from this class. The theoretical reasoning reveals that an increased prior probability, which shifts the decision boundary away from the class mean, will increase the assignment and boost the producer’s accuracy as compared to the use of equal priors; though the change of the user’s accuracy is not constant, it is expected to decrease in most cases. The tendency is just the opposite when a lower prior probability is used. A case study was conducted using Landsat TM data provided along with ERDAS Imagine ® software.

A total of 528 students selected from Urmia secondary schools through stratified sampling responded to the questionnaire. The research data were collected using the standard questionnaires (Cultural capital: A researcher-made questionnaire based on the Bourdieu's theory, Social trust: Based on the Rosenberg’s (1956) notion of misanthropy, Institutional trust: A researcher-made questionnaire (Sabbagh et al., 2013) and Students' sense of school belonging: A 5-point Likert scale designed by Goodenow (1993)) and their validity and reliability were confirmed.Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to study and evaluate the relationships between the studied variables. Path analysis results showed that, there is a positive and significant relationship between cultural capital and (social–institutional) trust, cultural capital and sense of school belonging and, between (social–institutional) trust and sense of school belonging.So, it can be concluded that, there is a positive and significant relationship between cultural capital of students and sense of school belonging by mediating role of trust in high school students.","[{""country"":[""Iran, Islamic Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this study, the investigators explored the hemostatic effects of Microporous Polysaccharide Hemosphere (MPH) applied in a rat model with severe femoral artery bleeding. Twelve rats were randomly assigned to MPH and control groups: The femoral artery of each rat was pierced to initiate bleeding. Then, 0.25 g MPH was poured into the bleeding site. A 200-g scale weight was placed over the bleeding site for 30 sec. At 30-sec intervals, the scale weight was removed, and hemostasis was assessed visually. After 30 sec, if the bleeding had ceased, the test was scored and checked as ""passed at 30 sec."" If the bleeding had not stopped, the same procedures were repeated a maximum of 3 times. If hemostasis could not be achieved even after the third application, the test was scored as failed. The same sequence of procedures was repeated for the control group without use of MPH and with only standard compression. Application of MPH resulted in complete control of bleeding in 2 of 6, 4 of 6, and 6 of 6 rats at 30, 60, and 90 sec, respectively. In the control group, however, hemostasis could not be achieved in all 6 rats, even at 90 sec. The difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P=.007). Application of MPH and compression with a scale weight significantly decreased the time of hemostasis in the rat model with femoral arterial bleeding.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We combine health data originating from the 2008 household survey with meteorological data to define shocks at the child level. We first estimate the marginal effect of rainfall at various ages on the child's health in order to identify the critical period during which deprivation has the most severe consequences. Then we look for a different impact of shocks on girls and boys that would reflect a gender bias in intra household resource allocation. We also assess the household ability to smooth consumption by testing for an asymmetric effect of rainfall shocks according to their size and by testing the impact of shocks according to household endowments. Results evidence a strong relationship between rainfall shocks during the prenatal period and child health. Households are not able to dampen small but negative rainfall shocks. Unexpectedly, girls are less severely affected by shocks than boys. The robustness of results is tested by using the sibling and difference-in-differences estimators as well as placebo regressions.","[{""country"":[""Burkina Faso""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Geospatial Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The vacuum created by the state and non-government organizations (NGOs) regarding rural development is (sometimes) filled by so called 'organization' including village level and religious non-profit organizations. Such organizations claim that they are deeply rooted in the traditional and religious culture of the province, and that they are in a better position to address the issues related to prevailing rural poverty and inequality in the marginalized areas. These organizations and social movements even challenge the state departments in providing basic services to the rural communities. This paper, examined the social organizations in a broader perspective of civil society movement. The data were collected from Abbottabad and Mansehra district of (former) Hazara division of KP. The results showed that the organizations working in the study region can be broadly classified into three categories; the organizations working for rural development/human rights, cultural identity and religious identity. Majority of the organizations was working in both rural and urban areas. It was found that these organizations mostly relied on voluntary staff. In most of the cases, at district and provincial level, these organizations had linkages and networking with other organizations on different issues e.g. for child rights, women rights, rights of forest users and owners, rights of growers and landless labourers.

At one level this research resolves empirically the debate that exist in literature whether child work is direct outcome of poverty or not in context of Pakistan through assessing the impact of the poverty channel for both likelihood of sending a child for paid work versus probability of enrolling a child into school and on other tries to connect the above line of reasoning with other non-income channels so as to build more enriching perspective. The consequences of household socioeconomic level in terms of its poor or non-poor status on child employment and child enrollment likelihood functions is assessed using both a direct measure of poverty based on household consumption expenditure information and also indirect measures based on access (or lack of it to be more specific) of household to electricity, sewerage system and to type of housing in terms of number of rooms and durability of house. In our empirical evidence, we do find strong support for poverty channel both directly and indirectly acting as defining force in decreasing his or her probability for school enrollment. However in context of effect of poverty on probability of child employment we do not find strong evidence through direct measure of poverty based on household consumption information, however the indirect proxies of poverty level of the household as child belonging to poor status in terms of access to certain type of living [living in house with no electricity, kaccha type of house (not bricked and hence vulnerable to fall), no sewerage system and with just one room] do provide strong evidence in support of poverty channel of impact on increasing the chances of child work. Further demographic information whether it is in form of increasing sibling size or impact of number of adult earners or parental background variables such as employment status of parents and their employment categories provides support for the significance of how being resource poor can be a binding constraint for the household and can act as an impetus to send a child towards paid work against schooling.","[{""country"":[""Pakistan""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

At the initiative of the Nordic Council of Ministers, a special Statistical Secretariat was established in 1969 to oversee the cooperation and publish, among other things, a statistical yearbook. To support the development of statistics, standing committees were set up for various areas of statistics, with the Secretariat being responsible for overseeing the preparatory work of these committees. The heads of the statistical agencies met once a year to define the focus of the cooperation and to evaluate progress.

Method: Participants completed a 13 week AB single-subject multiple-baseline design study with social validation and five month follow up interviews. Results: The findings indicated the deliberate practice intervention to be effective in enhancing the putting performance of all participants from baseline to intervention phases. Mean performance measure scores were significantly higher in the intervention phase than the baseline phase. Social validation and follow up interviews revealed all participants enjoyed undertaking deliberate practice, experienced a range of psychological and technical improvements, adapted current training schedules to mirror deliberate practice and committed long term to activities of this nature. Conclusions: Deliberate practice has the potential to improve putting performance of aspiring elite adolescent golfers and was viewed by all participants as a key strategy in successfully bridging the gap to elite adolescent status. Findings provide support for practitioners, sport psychologists and policy makers who may wish to expose aspiring elite golfers to golf specific deliberate practice regimes for the first time during late adolescence. © 2013 International Research Association for Talent Development and Excellence.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Although traditional norms have not lost their primacy in public life, we emphasize the fact that attitudes toward masculinity have, in general, become increasingly ambiguous and multivalent. While local sociological studies accurately observe that violence and intolerance constitute central traits for the majority of men in the West Balkans, our research reflects on how popular culture complicates the idea that postwar West Balkan masculinities have remained uniform, static, and defined exclusively by aggression.

The analysis controls for endogeneity and omitted variable bias by using instruments that identify the firms likely to receive the largest tax benefits from the holiday. Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D -- even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost $1 in payouts to shareholders.

The African Union endorsed the 2063 Agenda, the continent’s shared strategic framework for inclusive growth and sustainable development. The public service in Africa, as globally, is under pressure to produce and show outcomes as a measure of government’s effectiveness in meeting these goals. Genuine change requires critical self-reflection. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of government performance is essential to document and report on performance, promote learning and improvement. M&E is a mechanism to assess and analyse pre-determined levels of performance, and to report progress on the adoption of performance information. The National Monitoring and Evaluation Systems (NMES) contribute to the establishment of a continuous improvement culture in service delivery and feed information into SDG and Agenda 2063 implementation reports. M&E is an effective public administration tool to plan, coordinate, document and share results effectively and timeously, as translated into ministerial/departmental, and sectional units of project M&E systems and plans. The article argues that the capacity of public service human resources is key in the M&E function and agenda. Ethics in M&E processes enhance M&E systems to underpin national priorities and collect information that feeds into M&E of global strategies such as SDGs and Agenda 2063.","[{""country"":[""Africa""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In many cases the width of predictive probability distributions for variables of interest is significantly larger than the difference between the expected values of the results for different policy alternatives. This seems to lead to a serious problem for model-based decision support, as policy actions appear to have an “insignificant” effect on decision variables relative to the predictive uncertainty. However, in some cases it is evident that some of the alternatives at least lead to changes with the desired trend. A formal analysis of this argument is made based on the dependence of the probability distribution of the variables of interest for different policy alternatives. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the uncertainty in the difference of model results based on different policy alternatives may be significantly smaller than the uncertainty in the results themselves. The knowledge about the width of this distribution is useful to assess the effectiveness of the alternative especially in the presence of high uncertainty of the predictions. This general argument is illustrated for phosphorus reduction scenarios in a simple, didactical model of phosphorus loading to a lake.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Researchers have not sought to experimentally validate the mediation of self-focus in this relationship, however. Two studies are reported that were intended to provide evidence on this point. The studies also integrate the impairment hypothesis with a broader model of self-regulation, in which self-focus is sometimes facilitating and sometimes debilitating, depending upon the person's expectancies of being able to perform adequately. In Experiment 1, subjects high and low in test anxiety attempted a series of anagrams in an evaluative situation. As predicted, rather than exerting a uniformly adverse effect, experimentally enhanced self-focus interacted with level of test anxiety, improving performances among low-anxious subjects, impairing them among the test-anxious. Subjects in Experiment 2 attempted an insoluble test item, while their persistence was unobtrusively monitored. Self-directed attention once again interacted with level of test anxiety, so as to increase persistence among low-anxious subjects and to decrease it among the test-anxious. In neither study was there strong evidence that the difference in responding to self-focus was mediated by expectancy of performing well. A general discussion addresses this issue, along with the following: the relationship between these studies and the earlier literature of test anxiety, the theoretical implications of the fact that self-focus had interactive effects, and the fact that the theoretical model predicting these effects was developed in the context of normal, rather than abnormal, behavior.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Our study aimed to test a multivariate syndromic surveillance system to evaluate if the sensitivity and the specificity of detection of WNV could be improved. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Weekly time series data on nervous syndromes in horses and mortality in both horses and wild birds were used. Baselines were fitted to the three time series and used to simulate 100 years of surveillance data. WNV outbreaks were simulated and inserted into the baselines based on historical data and expert opinion. Univariate and multivariate syndromic surveillance systems were tested to gauge how well they detected the outbreaks; detection was based on an empirical Bayesian approach. The systems' performances were compared using measures of sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: When data sources were considered separately (i.e., univariate systems), the best detection performance was obtained using the data set of nervous symptoms in horses compared to those of bird and horse mortality (AUCs equal to 0.80, 0.75, and 0.50, respectively). A multivariate outbreak detection system that used nervous symptoms in horses and bird mortality generated the best performance (AUC = 0.87). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The proposed approach is suitable for performing multivariate syndromic surveillance of WNV outbreaks. This is particularly relevant, given that a multivariate surveillance system performed better than a univariate approach. Such a surveillance system could be especially useful in serving as an alert for the possibility of human viral infections. This approach can be also used for other diseases for which multiple sources of evidence are available.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Therefore to study the biology and pathophysiology of pigmentation and vitiligo, reliable in vitro skin pigmentation models are required. Aim: In this study, we used primary cultured melanocytes and keratinocytes to prepare the skin co-culture model in control and vitiligo patients. Methods: The skin grafts were taken from control and patients of vitiligo. In vitro co-culture was prepared after culturing primary melanocytes and keratinocytes. Co- cultures were treated with melanogenic stimulators and inhibitors and after that tyrosinase assay, MTT assay and melanin content assay were performed. Results: Melanocytes and keratinocytes were successfully cultured from control and vitiligo patients and after that co-culture models were prepared. After treatment of co-culture model with melanogenic stimulator we found that tyrosinase activity, cell proliferation and melanin content increased whereas after treatment with melanogenic inhibitor, tyrosinase activity, cell proliferation and melanin content decreased. We also found some differences in the control co-culture model and vitiligo co-culture model. Conclusion: We successfully constructed in vitro co-culture pigmentation model for control and vitiligo patients using primary cultured melanocytes and keratinocytes. The use of primary melanocytes and keratinocytes is more appropriate over the use of transformed cells. The only limitation of these models is that these can be used for screening small numbers of compounds.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Presenting evidence from Sierra Leone, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Sudan, it finds that appeal to a morality based on rights and principles allows aid staff to justify their operational weaknesses by blaming or discrediting others. The terminology used casts political and military activity as illegitimate, forestalling dialogue, limiting aid organisations’ perception of the contexts in which they work, and ultimately questioning the sincerity of the assistance. The book concludes that people in countries at war are not ‘breaking the rules’ of assistance – as assistance is not meaningfully ‘ruled’ by rights or principles – they are more fundamentally ‘not playing the game’.","[{""country"":[""Congo, Dem.

Families of the disappeared started searching for them; organized in victims’ associations on a local, national, and transnational level; demanded truth and justice; and became important human rights actors in Mexico. Therein, the processes of dehumanization by state actors during the dirty war are responded to by processes of rehumanization by the families of the disappeared. Their fight for rehumanization comprises practices and discourses of memory such as the development of social memory groups, political rituals with representations and narratives about the disappeared, and the construction of memory places. In response to the political agency of victims, the government implemented transitional justice instruments. But within these processes, the multiple transitional frictions (as described by Alexander Hinton) between global norms and local realities of power became visible. Remembering the disappeared in Mexico is, rather, part of a countermemory than of the collective or national memory.

Eighty first-year students from a private university in southern Taiwan are surveyed. All of them are EFL majors. Respondents are asked to answer two questions about the frequency of their fear of speaking in an English class and the causes of that fear. The findings show that over half of the respondents feel speaking anxiety in English classes either all the time or almost all the time. The major causes of student English speaking anxiety belong to three interrelated and intersect groups: psychological, educational, and socio-cultural. With regard to the main psychological cause, the overwhelming majority of first-year students noted they feel reluctant to speak English aloud for fear of not understanding or misunderstanding the teacher’s question or task. The second group of speaking anxiety causes is related to the students’ current and pre-university English learning experience. In this group, the most frequently mentioned factors are lack of fluency, making errors, poor knowledge of vocabulary, and insufficient oral practice in class. Hence, lack of confidence leads to fear of public failure and/or ridicule. In respect of the third group, including sociocultural factors, the main cause turns out to be the traditional shyness of the Chinese people and their dislike of speaking in public. The paper concludes with a number of suggestions on how to reduce learners' fear of speaking during English classes.","[{""country"":[""Taiwan, China""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The recent empirical literature, however, paints a mixed picture about the economic viability of rural electrification. Although many studies find substantial socioeconomic benefits from rural electrification, others propose that these benefits are overstated. This paper examines the hypothesis that the magnitude and the nature of benefits associated with electrification are highly context dependent. Using a panel data of 7,018 rural households in Bangladesh for 2005 and 2010, the paper explores two underlying determinants of the heterogeneity: the quality of electricity supply and the number of years of being connected to the grid. The analysis uses an instrumental variable and propensity-score-weighed fixed-effects model to address potential endogeneity of electricity adoption. The analysis finds that power outages have a negative impact on almost all development outcomes considered, while some benefits of electrification accrue only over the long run. The overall gain from expanding access to and improving reliability of electricity supply in Bangladesh is estimated to be US$2.3 billion a year.","[{""country"":[""Bangladesh""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The technology - wealth relationship is complex and not well understood presently but recent macro data tends to support Robert Solow’s 1957 observation that societal, company, and individual wealth and increased standards of living is created by application of science and technology to socio-economic challenges. In 1987, Robert Solow received the Nobel Prize in Economics, for his insight that “seven-eighths” of the world’s increase in world wealth is due to advances in science and technology. The challenges and costs of of wealth creation are identified. This paper explores wealth as defined by GDP/capita, and the current correlations between world/GDP per capita and R&D spending, the number of scientific and technical articles, and number of patents applications from 2000 to 2012/2013 with a forecast of world GDP/capita to 2025 of approximately $15,000 USD from today’s $10,000 USD.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The first part of the book is about the theory and ideas of complexity. This is explained in a way that is thorough but not mathematical. It compares differing approaches, and also provides a historical perspective, showing how such thinking has been around since the beginning of civilisation. It emphasises the difference between a complexity worldview and the dominant mechanical worldview that underpins much of current management practice. It defines the complexity worldview as recognising the world is interconnected, shaped by history and the particularities of context. The comparison of the differing approaches to modelling complexity is unique in its depth and accessibility. The second part of the book uses this lens of complexity to explore issues in the fields of management, strategy, economics, and international development. It also explores how to facilitate others to recognise the implications of adopting a complex rather than a mechanical worldview and suggests methods of research to explore systemic, path-dependent emergent aspects of situations. The authors of this book span both science and management, academia and practice, thus the explanations of science are authoritative and yet the examples of changing how you live and work in the world are real and accessible.

To gain a more reliable answer to this question, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol or the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) as diagnostic tests to help identify pleural exudates. Literature databases were systematically searched for studies examining accuracy of pleural cholesterol or P/S cholesterol ratios for diagnosing pleural exudates. Data on sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio (PLR/NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled using bivariate-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were used to summarize overall test performance. Our meta-analysis included up to 20 studies involving 3,496 subjects. Summary estimates for pleural cholesterol in the diagnosis of pleural exudates were as follows: sensitivity, 0.88 (95%CI 0.84 to 0.92); specificity, 0.96 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98); PLR, 20.31 (95% CI 11.21 to 36.78); NLR, 0.12 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.17); DOR, 167.06 (95% CI 76.79 to 363.95); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98). The corresponding summary performance estimates for using the P/S cholesterol ratio were as follows: sensitivity, 0.94 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.96); specificity, 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.91); PLR 7.46 (95% CI, 5.47 to 10.19); NLR, 0.07 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.10); DOR, 107.74 (95% CI 60.91 to 190.60); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98). Both pleural cholesterol level and the P/S cholesterol ratio are helpful for the diagnosis of pleural exudates. Nevertheless, the results of pleural cholesterol assays should be interpreted in parallel with the results of traditional tests and clinical information.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In exploiting the fallibility of the first-person narrator, Slater insists on the legitimacy of metaphor in accounts of childhood illness that are more concerned with narrative truth than historical accuracy. The result of this playfulness and general misrule is that Slater writes herself into a double bind: on one side, she is the child narrator who inadvertently misrepresents events and misdirects readers, and on the other side, she is the untrustworthy author who employs metaphor as a licence to lie.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Because party identification is partly based on images of the social group characteristics of the parties, the social profiles of political candidates should affect levels of partisan voting. A candidate's religious affiliation enables a test of this hypothesis. Using survey experiments which vary a hypothetical candidate's religious affiliation, we find strong evidence that candidates’ religions can affect partisan voting. Identifying a candidate as an evangelical (a group viewed as Republican) increases Republican support for, and Democratic opposition to, the candidate, while identifying the candidate as a Catholic (a group lacking a clear partisan profile) has no bearing on partisan voting. Importantly, the conditional effect of candidate religion on partisan voting requires the group to have a salient partisan image and holds with controls for respondents’ own religious affiliations and ideologies.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In this context, today the concept of Income Society promotes the connection of these three behaviors without the frontiers of a few decades ago. Therefore, the present study had the objective of reflecting on the income society and its relationship with traditional society, organizations and man. Thus, to carry out such reflections, the present research, from a literary review, initially understood the path from traditional society to the society of income. He then compared what changes occurred in organizations in the face of this new concept of society. Finally, he addressed how this new concept of society affected human behavior, emphasizing the concept of Burn-out syndrome. As a result of these comparisons, it was possible to identify mainly that the income society brought a short-term view of the employee's relationship with the organizations, contrasting with the stability scenario experienced in traditional society. In addition, when it comes to the relationship between man and organizations, the need for continuous income, requiring flexibility, adaptation and provoking addictive competitiveness in the employee, leads man to coexist between self-realization and self-destruction, leading to the development of pathologies ranging from depression to the Burn-out syndrome. As a suggestion to avoid the development of such pathologies, the recommendations indicated in this study were: (i) to use time management in the definition of personal and professional goals; (ii) apply coaching techniques to aggregate concrete actions to defined personal and professional goals; (iii) diagnose the balance level of employees through the Matrix of Life; and (iv) develop leaders in the organization by providing the maintenance of the personal balance in the employees and results for the organization.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The “equate-to-differentiate” approach, which is proposed as a means by which weak dominance can be made applicable in more general cases in binary choice, is presented to account for the observed violations of independence. [Journal of Business 59 (1986) S251] transparency hypothesis concerning violations of the independence axiom is compared with the equate-to-differentiate hypothesis. The findings for various decision tasks favor the equate-to-differentiate explanation. The results support the claim that the violation of independence should be observed when the equate-to-differentiate strategy is caused to be changed by the experimental conditions applied, but not otherwise.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, while adaptive management has received significant uptake in theory, it remains elusively difficult to enact in practice. Proponents have blamed social barriers and have called for social science contributions. We address this gap by adopting a qualitative approach to explore the development of an ecological monitoring program within an adaptive management framework in a public land management organization in Australia. We ask what practices are used to enact the monitoring program and how do they shape learning? We elicit a rich narrative through extensive interviews with a key individual, and analyze the narrative using thematic analysis. We discuss our results in relation to the concept of ‘knowledge work’ and Westley’s (2002) framework for interpreting the strategies of adaptive managers—‘managing through, in, out and up.’ We find that enacting the program is conditioned by distinct and sometimes competing logics—scientific logics prioritizing experimentation and learning, public logics emphasizing accountability and legitimacy, and corporate logics demanding efficiency and effectiveness. In this context, implementing adaptive management entails practices of translation to negotiate tensions between objective and situated knowledge, external experts and organizational staff, and collegiate and hierarchical norms. Our contribution embraces the ‘doing’ of learning-by-doing and marks a shift from conceptualizing the social as an external barrier to adaptive management to be removed to an approach that situates adaptive management as social knowledge practice.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The lowering of the electron density of the dense-core vesicles of 60-80 nm seems to be directly connected with disulfiram administration, while the decrease of the amount of neurosecretory material in the neurosecretory cells of type I seems to be a secondary effect of the drug injection.

As the use of ICT by students depends on their perception of easy level of use, among other factors, this paper presents the construction and statistical validation process of the ICTs scale. The instrument was applied to a sample of 244 freshmen students of five health courses, offered by a public university in Brazil. The scale aims to evaluate whether students felt able to use ICT if they were used as tools for learning. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire applied in person during the period of a week. Statistical analysis of the principal (PC), factorial (PAF) and internal consistency (Alpha Coefficient) components was performed. The scale presents a unifactorial structure, with 37 items, explaining 88.25% of the total variance, and Alpha coefficient of 0.977. Results indicate a statistically valid and reliable scale. Further research in different education contexts is suggested.","[{""country"":[""Brazil""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It notes the importance for urban areas of an effective rural adaptation agenda - especially in maintaining the productivity and functioning of rural systems. It highlights the importance of today's infrastructure investments, taking into account climate changes, given the long lifespan of most infrastructure, and the importance of urban management engaging with changing risk profi les. One important part of this is the need to connect offi cial adaptation initiatives to the much-improved natural hazard risk assessment, management and mitigation capacity that responded to major disasters. The paper ends by describing a possible urban climate change adaptation framework, including changes needed at the national, state, city and neighbourhood levels, and linkages to mitigation.","[{""country"":[""India""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Intra Countries Health Inequalities and Air Pollution in Developing Countries","This paper examines the link between health inequalities, air pollution and political institutions. In health economics literature, many studies have assessed the association between environmental degradation and health outcomes. This paper extends this literature by investigating how air pollution could explain health inequalities both between and within developing countries, and the role of political institutions in this relationship. Theoretically, we argue that differential in exposition to air pollution among income classes, prevention ability against health effect of environment degradation, capacity to respond to disease caused by pollutants and susceptibility of some groups to air pollution effect are sufficient to expect a positive link between air pollution and income related health inequality. Furthermore, in democratic countries, this heterogeneity in the health effect of pollution may be mitigated since good institutions favour universal health policy issues, information and advices about hygiene and health practices, and health infrastructures building. Our econometric results show that sulphur dioxide emission (SO2) and particulate matter (PM10) are in part responsible for the large disparities in infant and child mortalities between and within developing countries. In addition, we found that democratic institutions play the role of social protection by mitigating this effect for the poorest income classes and reducing the health inequality it provokes.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

One such example occurred at Southwest University where Native American students were protesting the university seal, which represents settler colonialism and genocide. In this article, we provide a case study of Joy, a Dine (Navajo) young woman, and describe her student activism in regards to the seal and how she utilizes it to connect to her culture, language, and identity. We utilize critical race theory (CRT) and tribal critical race theory (TribalCrit) to analyze the institutional microaggressions that Joy experienced on campus. Our main conclusions explain how student activism enables students to address systemic racism and provides a vehicle to create better conditions on university campuses.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Threat responses were measured physiologically, behaviorally, and subjectively. Perceivers interacting with stigmatized partners exhibited cardiovascular reactivity consistent with threat and poorer performance compared with participants interacting with nonstigmatized partners, who exhibited challenge reactivity. In Experiment 3, intergroup contact moderated physiological reactivity such that participants who reported more contact with Black persons exhibited less physiological threat when interacting with them.

The contributors, mostly honors administrators, included Charlie Slavin, Dean of the University of Maine Honors College, whose lead article provided ""one cornerstone ... that is common to the culture of honors: taking intellectual risks"" (15). George Mariz echoed Slavin in his claim that honors ""is, above all, a culture of intellectual effort"" (24). He posits that, ""while [it] is catholic and inclusive, it is also discriminating and critical"" (24). Jim Ford writes that another cornerstone of honors culture includes students with ""a passion for knowledge and for wisdom"" (28) while Paul Strong stresses the importance of shared identities, camaraderie, and a healthy dose of humor complementing the serious nature of the honors endeavor. How this culture is actually created in the classroom was the starting point of research undertaken at the behest of our dean by a group of students and faculty in the honors college at the university of Maine. While the administrators of honors programs have a sense of what they think characterizes an honors culture, our questions were how faculty and students understand and implement this culture in a classroom; how honors models and pedagogies play out; and what factors exert more influence than others in achieving the honors culture to which we aspire. In a program such as ours, with faculty coming from a number of disciplinary homes and schools of thought, we wanted to know how the culture of honors is cultivated in practice. As Charlie Slavin is fond of saying, ""some people get honors and some don't."" Our study is a preliminary one only, a point to keep in mind throughout the discussion. A much larger research project would be necessary to draw broad conclusions, but this study sheds some light on the nature of honors culture from the perspective of faculty and students and, as such, is a worthwhile contribution to that ""rich and varied conversation"" described by Long. our research focused on the first course that incoming students take in honors (HON 111) and included observations of only the first five weeks in two of the sixteen sections of the course offered in the fall 2009 semester. using non-participant observation in the classrooms and surveys of students and faculty, we sought to understand how a random group of individuals brought together in a section of HON 111 emerges as a class with a shared identity and purpose. Classroom culture is informed by several interest groups: in this case, the honors college itself in terms of course structure and curricula; the faculty; and the students. All three stakeholders bring an understanding and set of experiences that shape their notion of what it means to be a participant in education, albeit from different roles and perspectives. The college's objectives are defined in its statement of purpose while those of the faculty are formally articulated orally and/or in their written course outlines. occasionally students participate in this process; more typically, they are the passive recipients of an imposed structure and curriculum. our research was aimed at discerning how these constituencies contributed to the creation of classroom culture within the context of the University of Maine Honors College. The concept of ethnogenesis--"" a way of looking at culture as a historical and complex process of cultural and group formation"" (Skoggard)--was the organizing theoretical framework for the research as it describes the process whereby groups deliberately create or are defined by a common identity. Although etymologically rooted in identities forged from ethnic or national relationships, ethnogenesis is a term relevant to a study of honors culture, where stakeholders work to create a shared culture and identity in relation to the surrounding physical, intellectual, and interpersonal environments. …","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

EEG-based assessment of wakefulness regulation in dif- ferent mood states in bipolar disorder – A retrospective analysis—","Introduction Combined nigral and subthalamic stimulation is under consideration to modulate otherwise resistant axial motor symptoms, namely freezing of gait in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). The impact of subthalamic or nigral stimulation on neuromuscular motor integration however needs further characterization. Methods We used fully mobile EEG and EMG recordings, wireless kinematic sensors and video documentation to record patients during a gait cycle. Seven patients with deep brain stimulation were examined both during walking and standing after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medications. Recordings in different therapeutic conditions were obtained, i.e. ‘stimulation off’ (StimOff), ‘subthalamic stimulation on’ (STNOn), and ‘nigral stimulation on’ (SNrOn). Results The main finding was an increase of intermuscular coherence in the alpha and low beta bands during ‘walking’ in both STNOn and SNrOn. During ‘standing’ there was increased coherence in theta and alpha bands (‘STNOn’) and in the alpha and low beta bands (‘SNrOn’). Discussion Subthalamic and nigral stimulation increase intermuscular beta band coherence. Intermuscular beta band coherence may reflect increased corticospinal motor control from corticospinal beta drives to the spinal motor unit pool (Marsden et al., 2001; Weiss et al., 2012).","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Cutaneous allodynia is a painful sensation or discomfort induced by a non-noxious stimulus, and is a frequent complaint during migraine attacks. The aim of this study was to compare the personality profile of allodynic and non-allodynic migraineurs to identify possible relationships between psychological aspects and the presence of allodynia. The Symptom Check List 90-R (SCL90R), a 90-item self-report psychological symptom inventory, was used to investigate the psychological profile of our patients. The presence of allodynia was assessed by a set of semi-structured questions that investigated if the patient experienced abnormal scalp sensitiveness and/or discomfort during headache episodes. Twenty-five nonallodynic patients and 38 allodynic migraineurs were studied. No significant difference was found between the two groups in any area of the personality profile. The psychological profile seems not to affect the presence/absence of cutaneous allodynia in migraine patients. This reinforces the hypothesis that allodynia is a ""somatic"" symptom, not modified by psychological aspects.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Currently, two of the three Baltic countries have PRR parties represented in their national parliaments, Nacionā lā apvienī ba (the National Alliance, henceforth the NA) in Latvia and Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, henceforth EKRE) in Estonia. Both parties have charismatic leaders and are led in a top-down manner, keeping in line with the literature on this party family. Many political actors in numerous countries make ample use of Twitter and other social media, and the PRR in particular has proved very successful at using social media to their advantage. My article provides a comparison between the leadership of the two aforementioned parties, using a paired comparison method, highlighting the position of the party leader; how each leader is selected; the political activity of party leaders; the electoral activity of each leader; and, finally, an analysis of how each party leader uses the social media microblogging site, Twitter. The NA and EKRE are similar in that they are both parties which can be categorized in the PRR party family and are nationalist parties in countries which experienced Soviet occupation as well as the policy of Russification. Further, until quite recently1, both have directed nativist policies around language issues and the Russian-speaking population (Auers and Kasekamp 2013, Wierenga 2017). Therefore, the NA and EKRE make for an ideal comparison.2","[{""country"":[""Estonia""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Preoperative esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy (EGD) should detect and treat pathologies that might alter the type of bariatric surgery. However, clinical consequences of these findings are often insignificant. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of preoperative endoscopy in our cohort and its clinical consequences. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We conducted a retrospective analysis of endoscopic findings in patients under evaluation for bariatric surgery. Endoscopic findings were compared to preoperative risk factors as well as postoperative complications, and its clinical consequences were analyzed. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Data was available for 801 patients. Abnormal endoscopic findings were found in 65.7% of all patients. The most common conditions were gastritis (32.1%) and gastroesophageal reflux (24.8%). Malignancies were observed in 0.5% of all patients. We observed early-stage adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in two patients through our routine preoperative evaluation. Helicobacter pylori infections were detected in preoperative biopsies in only 3.7% of all patients. Patients who reported reflux symptoms had a higher rate of pathological EGDs (74.2 vs. 64.9%, p .019). We did not find any other risk factors for a pathological endoscopy. The postoperative complication rate was 11.2%. Leakage rate was 1.1%. Mortality rate was 0.4%. We did not find any correlation between the incidence of postoperative complications and preoperative endoscopic findings. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Relevant findings in routine preoperative endoscopy are rare but have significant influence on decision-making in bariatric patients and should be assessed as a necessary diagnostic tool.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Private Sector Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Such a task is particularly important in cases where the data quality at old age, in particular the age exaggeration, is not sufficient for reliable mortality estimates. Our tests are based on period data from the Human Mortality Database and the use of the Horiuchi–Coale and Mitra formulas for reducing the bias of life expectancy in the open age interval. We show that extrapolation accuracy is substantially improved when the extrapolation is constrained by either the empirical life expectancy or the Horiuchi–Coale or Mitra estimates. Unconstrained extrapolations and those constrained by conventional life table estimates of life expectancy in the open age interval show substantial biases and should be avoided. Combining extrapolation with life expectancy estimates which are robust to the effects of age exaggeration appears to be a valuable way of improving mortality estimation.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Hence, such disorders may have a negative impact on children’s mental health. These children often experience loneliness and inferiority complex, communication problems, lack of mental health, postponement of development, psychological problems as well as educational disimprovements. Therefore, such mental-educational problems along with other disorders form a cluster of mishaps in which children may not be able to meet their most superficial needs. Method & Material: The current research has been designed based on the case study model and approximate reasoning approach as an alternative for traditional approaches. The participant of the study is a second-grade pupil who had the primary symptoms of learning disorders in mathematics in Zakariaye Razi Primary School in Mashhad. He was, then, introduced to Baharestan Center of Learning Disorders in Mashhad. The necessary data were collected according to the Wexler Test of Children WISC-R, Bender Gestalt Visual Motor Test, Frastig Perceptive-Visual Discrimination Test, Wapmann Auditory Discrimination Test, Lincoln-Oseretsky Motor Development Tests and Laterality Test. Since the data of the current research were based on the individual pupil, the researcher utilized Rood-Kafman software to analyze them. Findings: The findings of the study indicate that the subject, in the diagnosis test phase, manifested as having operations in line with the pattern of the symbols of math disorder. Despite the fact that he was in the second grade, but the pupil did not meet the objective functions in test operations. Hence, he encountered cognitive obstacles encountered in the classification operations. With respect to the comparison of pre-test - post-test, the study found that he not only needed visual-motor integration and visual fixation skills but also he required spatial-visual skills and strengthening of the calculation skill. Results: In accordance with the mathematical learning of Piaget’s (1998) hierarchy system, the pupil under study will reach the sufficient cognitive scale in solving math problems.","[{""country"":[""Iran, Islamic Rep.""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

In 1977, the University of Chicago Press published his revised doctoral dissertation, Stateville; The Penitentiary in Mass Society (1977). In 1982, Jacobs moved to New York University (NYU) as professor of law and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice. In the mid 1980s, he served as consultant to the New York State Organized Crime Task Force’s investigation of corruption and racketeering in NYC’s construction industry. Jacobs was the draftsman of OCTF’s Final Report on Corruption and Racketeering in NYC’s Construction Industry (NYU Press, 1990). He subsequently published four additional volumes on organized crime and organized crime control, most recently Breaking the Devil’s Pact: The Battle to Free the Teamsters from the Mob (2011).","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Despite previous studies, the results suggested that African American college students who attended a historically black college needed similar counseling services as those who attended majority white colleges and universities. In addition, the analyses in this study suggested that new and younger African American college students may benefit from the “typical” counseling and outreach services, such as, date rape education and drug education. Further studies in this area were recommended for historically black college administrators. Purpose of the Study Since the early-1950’s, the increasing emotional problems of U.S. college students have led administrators to routinely assess the need for counseling-related services at colleges and universities (Chandler, 1994). Despite the growing need for counseling, there is a limitation in the receptiveness of counseling-related services at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Previous studies have suggested that the resistance to college services at HBCUs was due to cultural factors (Wallace & Constantine, 2005). For example, African Americans were more likely to use spiritual counseling versus professional counseling to resolve personal conflicts or emotional problems, such as, date rape and alcohol abuse. Other studies have suggested that economic priorities have limited the availability of counseling-services at HBCUs (Hutto & Fenwick, 2002). For example, HBCUs were more likely to fund student development services that emphasized tutoring and remediation (e.g. the academic needs). In many instances, these services were considered a higher priority because they directly affected student recruitment and retention. In either case, research has supported the need to address the emotional and personal concerns of African American college students (Chandler, 1994; Chandler, 1999). The purpose of this study was to explore emotional sensitivity and the need for counseling-related services at HBCUs located in the southwest region of the United States.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, the immunophenotypic variation of NP-MSCs in vitro was unclear. The present study was conducted to address the immunophenotypic variation of mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus under continuous proliferation in vitro and show the difference between mesenchymal stem cells and nucleus pulposus cell. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Tissue samples were obtained from thoracolumbar burst fracture patients and degenerative disc disease patients who underwent discectomy and fusion procedures. Flow cytometric and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) were used to detect the variation of mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus which were expressing CD105 and CD24 in condition with or without transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: More than 90% of the analyzed primary cells of mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus fulfilled the general immunophenotyping criteria for MSCs, such as CD44, CD105 and CD29, but the marker of mature NP cells characterized as CD24 was negative. In continuous cultures, the proportion of mesenchymal stem cells which were expressing CD44, CD105 and CD29 in nucleus pulposus gradually decreased. The mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus cells were positive for CD105 and CD29, with slight positivity for CD44. The CD24 expression gradually increased in proliferation. Biparametric flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of cells which were expressing CD105 and CD24 independently, and only a small part of cells expressed both CD105 and CD24 simultaneously. TGF-β1 could stimulate mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus to express CD24. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Non-degenerative and degenerative NP contains mesechymal stem cells. The variation of CD24 can be used as a marker to identify the NP-MSCs differentiation into NP-like cells.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

However, this is a chimeric cliche of neoliberalism (rather like the idea that we are all postfeminist now). The ‘proud’ homosexual of the west is discursively constructed against the ‘shamed’ homosexual of the east, a typecasting resonant with postcolonial cliches of the primal, religious, and homophobic savagery of the global south in contrast with the civilising, liberal evolution of the secular global north. Shame displacement is of course a dynamic of shame itself. The perceived failure in achieving the ‘proud iconic gay’ of media cultures in the global North results in a traumatic double bind of being ashamed of being ashamed. This article will reconsider the cultural politics and temporality of shame for primarily white gay identities after the ‘War on Terror’.

Previous studies have shown a correspondence between the similarity of coarse-scale fMRI activation patterns and the perceived similarity of visual stimuli, suggesting that visual objects that appear similar also share similar underlying patterns of neural activation. Here we explore the temporal relationship between the human brain's time-varying representation of visual patterns and behavioral judgments of perceptual similarity. The visual stimuli were abstract patterns constructed from identical perceptual units (oriented Gabor patches) so that each pattern had a unique global form or perceptual 'Gestalt'. The visual stimuli were decodable from evoked neural activation patterns measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG), however, stimuli differed in the similarity of their neural representation as estimated by differences in decodability. Early after stimulus onset (from 50ms), a model based on retinotopic organization predicted the representational similarity of the visual stimuli. Following the peak correlation between the retinotopic model and neural data at 80ms, the neural representations quickly evolved so that retinotopy no longer provided a sufficient account of the brain's time-varying representation of the stimuli. Overall the strongest predictor of the brain's representation was a model based on human judgments of perceptual similarity, which reached the limits of the maximum correlation with the neural data defined by the 'noise ceiling'. Our results show that large-scale brain activation patterns contain a neural signature for the perceptual Gestalt of composite visual features, and demonstrate a strong correspondence between perception and complex patterns of brain activity.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Therefore, the aim of this work was to ascertain how plant species and land use management drive the diversity of the genus Burkholderia. In a greenhouse experiment, different crops, i.e., maize, oat, barley, and grass, were planted in pots containing soils with different land use histories, i.e., maize monoculture, crop rotation, and permanent grassland, for three consecutive growth cycles. The diversity of Burkholderia spp. in the rhizosphere soil was assessed by genus-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). CCA ordination plots showed that previous land use was the main factor affecting the composition of the Burkholderia community. Although most variation in the Burkholderia community structure was observed between the permanent grassland and agricultural areas, differences between the crop rotation and maize monoculture groups were also observed. Plant species affected Burkholderia community structure to a lesser extent than did land use history. Similarities were observed between Burkholderia populations associated with maize and grass, on the one hand, and between those associated with barley and oat, on the other hand. Additionally, CCA ordination plots demonstrated that these two groups (maize/grass versus barley/oat) had a negative correlation. The identification of bands from the DGGE patterns demonstrated that the species correlated with the environmental variables were mainly affiliated with Burkholderia species that are commonly isolated from soil, in particular Burkholderia glathei, B. caledonica, B. hospita, and B. caribiensis.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The findings demonstrate that, while board diversity has grown substantially in both countries in recent years, it has done so considerably more rapidly in Norway than in the United Kingdom. The analysis highlights the sectoral variation between the countries in the pattern and growth of board diversity and suggests that the vast majority of the overall growth in board diversity is the result of changing firm behaviour rather than sectoral shift in the United Kingdom or Norwegian economies. It is also shown that as diversity has increased there has been no fall in how experienced female directors are; neither is there evidence of a rise in the number of boards that female directors sit on. This suggests that the rapid growth in board diversity has been achieved without any fall in the quality of female directors.","[{""country"":[""Norway"",""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Population/Business Census""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Hypoxia plays a pivotal role in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking during pregnancy imposes risk for the unborn child. In addition to carbon monoxide, conjugation of para-benzoquinone (pBQ), derived from cigarette smoke, with human hemoglobin (HbA) was also reported to contribute in hypoxia. In fact, conjugation of pBQ is more alarming than carbon monoxide as it is an irreversible covalent modification. In the present study, the functional assay of Hb-pBQ, performed through oxygen equilibrium curve, showed a significant decrease in both P50 and cooperativity. However, the structural changes associated with the observed functional perturbation of the hemoglobin conjugate (Hb-pBQ) are unknown to date. Enhanced sensitivity and high resolution of nano-ESI mass spectrometry platform have enabled to investigate the native structure of oligomers of hemoglobin in a single scan. The structural integrity of Hb-pBQ measured through the dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) indicated that compared to HbA, Kd of tetramer-dimer and dimer-monomer equilibria were increased by 4.98- and 64.3-folds, respectively. Using isotope exchange mass spectrometry, we observed perturbations in the inter-subunit interactions of deoxy and oxy states of Hb-pBQ. However, the three-dimensional architecture of Hb-pBQ, monitored through collision cross-sectional area, did not show any change. We propose that the significant destabilization of the functionally active structure of hemoglobin upon conjugation with pBQ results in tighter oxygen binding that leads to hypoxia.

Given the historic number of mail ballots and the increasing propensity for voters in California and elsewhere to choose this voting method, some basic questions are asked: Do voters favor ex- panding mail balloting? How will registrants who chose to vote at a polling place react when they are required to vote by mail? Does voting method affect voter’s confidence in the election system? Is there a difference in confidence levels among those required to vote by mail vs. self-selected absentee voters? Who do voters turn to for information regarding the election process, i.e., about how to cast their ballot? California offers researchers a unique quasi-experimental setting to answer these questions because of a discontinuity in the state Election Code that forces some registrants to vote by mail while other similar registrants are allowed to vote at a polling place. Data from two surveys are used: a statewide survey of both poll- ing place and mail voters conducted by the Field Poll, and a five-county survey of only mail voters conducted by the Survey Policy Research Institute.

A study of micro-practices of identity regulation","In the last decades, identity has become an increasing target and outcome of organizational control, notably through processes of identity regulation (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002). Several studies provide strong evidence of the relevance of the organizational practices of identity regulation identified by Alvesson and Willmott. However, we currently miss an understanding of ‘how’ these organizational practices are exercised by organizational members. This paper aims at advancing the identity regulation process understandings by providing evidence of specific practices through which organizational identity regulation practices are exercised. Through a qualitative longitudinal study of a managerial training, we found that identity regulation works through (1) practices of linguistic and conceptual resources providing and (2) practices of enactment of these resources. We have also identified ‘side’ practices which sustain and reassure both the participants’ engagement into the training and the discourse enactment. Despite this appearance of effectiveness, parasitic factors such as autonomous discourses produced by participants as well as individual previous identity and willingness to ‘play the game’ undermine the power of identity regulation which remains an uncertain process. Our contributions to the literature are threefold: we document various micro-practices through which identity regulation discourse is performed and linked to organizational members’ identity; we show that these identity regulation practices are sustained by ‘side’ practices; we argue that identity work understanding as an autonomous and individual process needs to be balanced because it can also be a deliberate target of identity regulation. This opens new paths for studies of identity construction processes inside organizations.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Observation, document analysis and interviews are methods used to collect qualitative data, while to obtain quantitative data using the CIPP method.The results of this study are the high needs of disabled people for the achievements of Sragen NPC. The support from the LGs to Sragen NPC is quite high by providing land and building grants for secretarial offices and giving the same bonus as normal athletes. NPC archery athletes are in good condition seen in terms of physical, mental and highly motivated. The trainer has fulfilled the specified qualifications and has a qualified experience, except that he cannot focus on training because his status is also a coach and athlete. For the organizational structure of Sragen NPC it is well structured. Organizations have programs and strategies to achieve existing goals by coordinating with relevant agencies to get HR support both athletes and coaches, funding, sarpras, and prioritizing potential athletes on certain numbers. The training program has been implemented by the coach for his athletes, unfortunately there are no written documents. The training infrastructure is in Diponegoro Gor and training facilities such as bow and arrow are private property. NPC funding was obtained from KONI from the Sragen regency budget. Recruitment is in accordance with the procedures for implementing the center, because there is selection in recruiting athletes and coaches. The exercise of the trainer provides an exercise program that emphasizes the skills of each athlete, and pays attention to the physical, technical and mental development of the athlete but the trainer makes the training program adjust the situation and the training program has not been recorded. Evaluation is carried out every exercise by the trainer and colleagues verbally and not yet recorded. The State of the Organization of NPC Sragen runs well and Every HR in the Organizational Structure carries out its duties according to the job description of each.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Here we used long term monitoring of colonies and screening for eleven disease agents and genes involved in bee immunity and physiology to identify predictive markers of honeybee colony losses during winter. The data show that DWV, Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor and Vitellogenin can be predictive markers for winter colony losses, but their predictive power strongly depends on the season. In particular, the data support that V. destructor is a key player for losses, arguably in line with its specific impact on the health of individual bees and colonies.","[{""country"":[""North America""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Overexpression and depletion analyses identified 22 unique genes that regulated NF-κB and ISRE reporter activity, viral replication, or virus-induced interferon production. Detailed mechanistic analysis defined a role for mind bomb (MIB) E3 ligases in K63-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, a kinase that phosphorylates IRF transcription factors controlling interferon production. Mib genes selectively controlled responses to cytosolic RNA. MIB deficiency reduced antiviral activity, establishing the role of MIB proteins as positive regulators of antiviral responses. The HI5 provides a dynamic physical and regulatory network that serves as a resource for mechanistic analysis of innate immune signaling.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We explored a possibility to extend the Ekvall's concept of creative climate for innovativeness from the level of individual organization to the national level. The main research goal was to identify fragments of national creative climate and to prove its relation to innovativeness. As the measurement for national innovativeness we took the Summary Innovation Index. The fragments of national creative climate were identified by 25 questions and answers selected from different public opinion polls published in the Eurobarometers. Using hierarchical clustering we clustered all EU member states and compared them with the clusters that identify Innovation Leaders, Innovation Followers, Moderate Innovators, and Catching-up countries. We found membership of both sets of clusters similar, which means that two essentially different sets of variables arriving from two completely different sources led to comparable result. We also identify top ten variables that contributed the most to distinguishing between Creative climate clusters. Finally, we argued that understanding creative or innovative climate in the EU countries is an important national policy-making tool that could complement hard macro-economic indicators that are focused on innovative performance only, and not also on innovative socio-cultural environment. We wished-for a unified approach in the EU to develop an objective measurement for creative climate at country level. We also discussed some research challenges linked to this idea.","[{""country"":[""European Union""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

It is well known that faster reaction times are observed for bimodal stimuli than for unimodal stimuli, and the facilitation is called redundancy gain. The present study manipulated figural configurations of visual motion stimuli, and examined whether the congruency of figural configurations between vision and touch would modulate the amount of redundancy gain and the reaction time distribution. The findings have important implications for the locus of multi-sensory integration between visual and tactile motion information.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Clashing worldviews can, as Robert Fogelin posited, render rational resolution to argument impossible.

In most research, the consent-gaining process is hidden from analytic scrutiny and is dealt with before data collection has begun. In contrast, conversation analytic research, which records interactional encounters from beginning to end, enables examination of this methodological ‘black box’. We explored how ‘requests’ to consent in research played out across different institutional settings. We found that participants had to ‘opt-out’ of a research process that was already underway. Consent-gaining sequences constrained opting out in two ways: (1) because research activity was already underway, it must be stopped affirmatively by participants; (2) consent-gaining turns were tilted in favour of continued participation, making opting out a dispreferred response. We also found a mismatch between what ethics guidelines specify about consent-gaining ‘in theory’ and what actually happens ‘in practice’. Finally, we make suggestions about interventions in and recommendations for existing practice to best achieve informed consent.","[{""country"":[""United Kingdom""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The validity of EFS forecasts compared to SCP forecasts increases in line with the quality of the legal environment and enforceability of contracts, with the increased weight of the markets compared to banks and with the share of banking assets held by banks that are majority-owned by foreign owners and by the government.

Biofilm formation may also be of importance for survival and virulence in food-related staphylococci. In the present work, staphylococci from the food industry were found to differ greatly in their abilities to form biofilms on polystyrene. A total of 7 and 21 of 144 food-related strains were found to be strong and weak biofilm formers, respectively. Glucose and sodium chloride stimulated biofilm formation. The biofilm-forming strains belonged to nine different coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. The icaA gene of the intercellular adhesion locus was detected by Southern blotting and hybridization in 38 of 67 food-related strains tested. The presence of icaA was positively correlated with strong biofilm formation. The icaA gene was partly sequenced for 22 food-related strains from nine different species of Staphylococcus, and their icaA genes were found to have DNA similarities to previously sequenced icaA genes of 69 to 100%. Northern blot analysis indicated that the expression of the ica genes was higher in strong biofilm formers than that seen with strains not forming biofilms. Biofilm formation on polystyrene was positively correlated with biofilm formation on stainless steel and with resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds, a group of disinfectants.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We use an LQR study conducted in continuing care retirement communities to demonstrate three dimensions that should be taken into consideration when addressing change vs. stability. Three waves of interviews with older adults and their family members as well as memos and reflections concerning interview data are used. The first dimension concerns the question of: “who defines change?” A second dimension raises the question of, “what has changed?” Finally, a third dimension concerns the timeframe of change. We argue that LQR provides a tremendous richness of time dimensions and perspectives. Discrepancies between dimensions, perspectives and timeframes can be particularly enriching. Moreover, LQR allows also for the opportunity to examine stability.","[{""country"":[""Israel""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

The study relied on interviews and document analysis for its methodology. Results revealed that the Commission has a set of guidelines for research funding application; although difficult to implement, capability-building activities are limited in number, and the number of approved research grant applications is much fewer than the rejected ones. These issues are due to many different factors both in the CHED application and review process, as well as factors related to faculty members and their university process.

In the study, 3 different scales were used on 368 students in total, who were studying in Sivas province in 2017-2018 Educational Year, found by convenience sampling method. The first scale is “the Personal Information Form”, which consists of 8 articles, for identifying the demographical characteristics of the participants; the second scale is “the Cognitive Behavioral Physical Activity Questionnaire (CBPA)”, which was developed by Schembre et al., (2015) and was adapted to Turkish by the validity and reliability study done by Eskiler et al., (2016), for identifying the participants’ attitudes towards physical activities. The third scale is “the Satisfaction with Life Scale”, which was developed by Diener et. al (2002) and prepared as 5-statement 5-point likert type, for identifying the participants’ levels of satisfaction with life. SPSS 25 package software was used in data analysis. The data were reflected as values of percentage, frequency, and average standard deviation. 180 sport high school students and 188 other high school students were participated in the study, when looked at the findings acquired. It was found that the attitude levels of sport high school students towards physical activities are higher than those of other high school students, and in parallel, it was seen that they have higher levels of satisfaction with life. As a result, it can be said that regular physical activity positively increases the individual’s satisfaction with life. Thus, regular physical activity is recommended.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Optimizations were compared using Dmax, Dmin, Dmedian and Dmean measures for the target volume and relevant risk structures. Final dose calculations were compared using gamma index with 1%/1 mm and 3%/3 mm acceptance criteria. 3D geometric evaluation was conducted using the DICE similarity coefficient for bony structures. 2D geometric comparison of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) was performed by manual delineation of relevant structures on the s-CT DRR that were transferred to the CT DRR and compared by visual inspection.ResultsDifferences for the target volumes in optimization comparisons were small in general, e.g. a mean difference in both Dmin and Dmax within ±0.3%. For the final dose calculation gamma evaluations, 100% of the voxels passed the 1%/1 mm criterion within the PTV. Within the entire external volume between 99.4% and 100% of the voxels passed the 3%/3 mm criterion. In the 3D geometric comparison, the DICE index varied between approximately 0.8-0.9, depending on the position in the skull. In the 2D DRR comparisons, no appreciable visual differences were found.ConclusionsEven though the present work involves a limited number of patients, the results provide a strong indication that optimization and dose calculation based on s-CT data is accurate regarding both geometry and dosimetry.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Due to scale economies and sunk costs, the roll-out of NGA is expected to be profitable only for large-scale providers and in densely populated areas. Nonetheless, alternative providers, such as utilities and local communities, have significantly contributed to NGA diffusion in many countries. Over the past five years, several small-scale initiatives have emerged in the UK, bringing fibre networks to urban and rural areas previously overlooked by either commercial or subsidised deployments. A multiple case study approach is employed here to explore the nature and the drivers of niche providers in the UK NGA market. All these initiatives are demand-driven and to follow a modular approach. Despite adopting different business models, they all rely on the resources inherited from past broadband initiatives and relationships with local partners. By investigating the strategies of niche providers in NGA market, this analysis sheds light on their contribution to bridging the digital divide in the UK and is presented as a preliminary assessment of their sustainability and potential growth. This paper explores the nature and the strategies of niche NGA providers in the UK.We demonstrate that alternative providers are significantly contributing to NGA diffusion.Our analysis illustrates the unique strategies developed by operators as they address their specific niche.Niche operator investments are demand-driven and leverage the resources within each niche.","[{""country"":[""Europe & Central Asia""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We therefore undertook a double-blind placebo controlled study to confirm these findings. Forty-three patients (35 males, 8 females, average age 6.8 yrs., range 2.1–10.3 yrs), with diagnoses of Autistic Spectrum Disorders enrolled in a randomized six-week, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil hydrochloride, with an additional six weeks of open-label treatment. Change was evaluated by the Childhood Autistic Rating Scale, Gardner’s Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test, Revised, and Gardner’s Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test. Testing was administered at baseline, six-week, and twelveweek follow-up. Expressive and receptive speech gains, as well as decreases in severity of overall autistic behavior, were documented after 6-weeks for the treatment group. These improvements were statistically significant when compared to placebo, and were clinically meaningful as assessed over time. Donepezil hydrochloride appears to improve expressive and receptive language as well as overall autistic features, consistent with the hypothesis of acetylcholinergic enhancement.

If participation rates at older ages remain constant (or decline), then average time spent in retirement will increase. Additionally, because health status and mortality are correlated, adults with more expected years of life are generally in better health (and better able to work) than those with fewer years of remaining life.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

The synthesised Ir(III) complexes have been characterised by elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy. The molecular structures for four Ir(III) complexes were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Each of the Ir(III) complexes exhibited intense photoluminescence in acetonitrile solution at room temperature with quantum yields (ΦPL) ranging from 58% to 86%. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed one oxidation process (formally ascribed to the metal centre), and two ligand-based reductions for each complex. Complexes 1–5 gave moderate to intense annihilation and co-reactant electrochemiluminescence (ECL).

In West Sumatra the process of decentralisation has a particularly dynamic and interesting character. Along with the general decentralisation of central political authority and economic resources to the districts, a fundamental restructuring of local village government has been initiated. The policy of regional autonomy has been taken up “to return to the nagari”. Nagari is the name of the traditional, pre-colonial political units of Minangkabau political organisation. Despite all changes and transformations during the colonial period and since Independence, the nagari and nagari government have remained firmly associated with Minangkabau political identity. This changed rather dramatically, when the Law on Local Government of 1979 introduced the uniform model of the desa as the lowest level of local government. The former nagari were split into several desa, administered by desa-heads embedded in the strictly hierarchical administrative system. When decentralisation became a major issue in Indonesia under the orde reformasi, this was taken up to abolish the desa system and go back to the nagari. The paper discusses the new role of adat and adat-leaders and councils within these political units vis-a-vis religious and governmental authority and ideals of bottom-up democracy and community rights. Decentralisation and the return to the nagari has led to a new interest in adat as a legitimation of political authority and rights to natural resources. The process is not only interesting for those interested in West Sumatra and Indonesia. It is of wider interest for the anthropology of law, because it is a current example of a changing constellation of legal pluralism induced by decentralisation policies. 1 Franz and Keebet von Benda-Beckmann are heads of the Project Group: Legal Pluralism, Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, P.O.

The magnitude of such consequences depends on the type, size, and activity of the economic sector. Moreover, the magnitude of such consequences depends on the degree of interdependencies between the economic sectors. This paper presents a simulation and analysis of the impacts of such a disaster on the economic sectors in a given region. We introduce a stochastic simulation model based on the dynamic inoperability input-output model (DIIM) to model the cascading effects of a disruptive event in the U.S. National Capital Region (NCR). The analysis conducted in this work is based on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic data. Two metrics were used to assess the impacts of the influenza pandemic on sectors: (i) inoperability, which is a measure of the percentage gap between the as-planned output and the actual output, and (ii) economic loss, which is a measure of the monetary value of the degraded output. The inoperability and economic loss metrics generate two different rankings of the economic sectors. Findings show that most of the critical sectors in terms of inoperability are sectors that are related to hospitals and healthcare-related providers. On the other hand, most of the sectors that are critically ranked in terms of economic loss are sectors with significant production outputs in the NCR region such as federal government agencies. Therefore, policy recommendations relating to potential mitigation and recovery strategies should take into account the balance between the inoperability and economic loss metrics.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data"",""Systematic Review or Meta Analysis Combining Varied Sources of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Lemley, and Jonathan S. Masur make a compelling case against the United States’ current full-cumulation approach to design protection, which allows designers to obtain protection for a qualifying design under copyright, trademark, and design patent law all at the same time and without any requirement of election. They also argue that design rights, including design patents, “have become too powerful” and suggest several “policy changes designed to bring design rights more in line with social welfare.” ::: ::: But while Buccafusco, Lemley, and Masur express great concern about what design patents cover, they do not discuss how the current test for design patent infringement actually works. Under that test, which was set forth ten years ago by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Egyptian Goddess, Inc. v. Swisa, Inc., design patents are given a much narrower scope than the cases discussed in Intelligent Design might seem to suggest. While this does not undermine the larger argument made by Buccafusco, Lemley, and Masur—namely, that we should not allow designers to gain the functional equivalent of a utility patent using the design patent system—it does affect the way we should evaluate some of their proposed policy solutions. ::: ::: Under Egyptian Goddess, the presumptive scope of a design patent is narrow and may be further narrowed if there is close prior art. Therefore, at least two of the proposals in Intelligent Design—namely, functionality screening, invalidity based on “principal features,” and adding an independent invention defense—may not be either appropriate or necessary. Adopting such proposals may have the unintended consequence of expanding or unnecessarily confusing design patent doctrine, results clearly not intended by the authors of Intelligent Design. Instead, a policy lever not discussed by Buccafusco, Lemley, and Masur—namely, statutory subject matter—may be more helpful in addressing the very valid concerns raised in Intelligent Design. ::: ::: This response will explain how courts analyze design patent infringement under the Federal Circuit’s Egyptian Goddess test. Then, it will discuss how the contemporary test for infringement might affect some of the solutions proposed in Intelligent Design. Finally, it discusses how the question of what constitutes proper statutory subject matter may be a more fruitful policy lever to explore in addressing these important issues of design patent law and policy.","[{""country"":[""United States""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

In this study, we investigated the association between mitochondria and TDP-43 in biopsied skeletal muscle samples from IBM patients. We found that IBM pathological markers TDP-43, phosphorylated TDP-43, and p62 all coexisted with intensively stained key subunits of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes I–V in the same skeletal muscle fibers of patients with IBM. Further immunoblot analysis showed increased levels of TDP-43, truncated TDP-43, phosphorylated TDP-43, and p62, but decreased levels of key subunits of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes I and III in IBM patients compared to aged matched control subjects. This is the first demonstration of the close association of TDP-43 accumulation with mitochondria in degenerating muscle fibers in IBM and this association may contribute to the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and pathological protein aggregates.","[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Average technical efficiency worked out to be 48%. Most of the farms were operating at low level of technical efficiency. There was also wide dispersion in technical efficiency across farm categories. Farm size and productivity efficiency relationship was found to be non-linear, with efficiency first falling and then rising with size. Large farms tend to have higher net farm income per acre and are technically efficient compared to other small farm size categories. The study further delineated the socio-economic, institutional and farm factors of technical efficiency using Two-limit Tobit Regression Model. The results showed that Occupation, Farm Experience, Household Size, Farm Size, Membership and Seed Type were found to be important determents that influence the discrepancies in technical efficiency across farm sizes.

This is manifested in 4 ways: (a) negative potency (negative entities are stronger than the equivalent positive entities), (b) steeper nega tive gradients (the negativity of negative events grows more rapidly with approach to them in space or time than does the positivity of positive events, (c) negativity domi nance (combinations of negative and positive entities yield evaluations that are more negative than the algebraic sum of individual subjective valences would predict), and (d) negative differentiation (negative entities are more varied, yield more complex conceptual representations, and engage a wider response repertoire). We review evi dence for this taxonomy, with emphasis on negativity dominance, including literary, historical, religious, and cultural sources, as well as the psychological literatures on learning, attention, impression formation, contagion, moral judgment, development, and memory. We then consider a variety of theoretical accounts for negativity bias. We suggest that 1 feature of negative events that make them dominant is that negative entities are more contagious than positive entities.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Frequently, there is a failure to connect workers’ individual outcomes with the wider societal, environment and/or organisational practices, and the worker perspective rarely explicitly features in conference themes.

In 2000, the signing of the United States-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement was an epic step in the normalization of relations. In addition, the BTA was hailed as a means of effectuating positive change in the area of Vietnam’s human rights. Unfortunately, the state of religious freedom in Vietnam has deteriorated while economic ties with the United States have strengthened. Despite Vietnam’s purported respect for religious freedom, violations continue. Vietnam restricts the practice of religion, detains religious leaders, and tolerates forced renunciations of faith by local officials. These acts violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Vietnam has acceded. Vietnam’s violations of the right to religious freedom have also drawn the concern of the international community. Specifically, the United States has called for improvements in Vietnam’s religious rights record, utilizing diplomatic means coupled with continued engagement in the hopes that Vietnam will voluntarily enact changes. However, this approach has failed to yield concrete progress. In 2004, the U.S. Department of State designated Vietnam a Country of Particular Concern as provided in the International Religious Freedom Act. Because the IRFA mandates affirmative action against violators of religious freedom, the United States must abandon constructive engagement in Vietnam. Instead, the IRFA provides the framework for opposing violations under the responsible engagement doctrine. In doing so, the United States may employ economic pressure to narrowly target violators, while allowing the liberalizing effect of engagement to continue where it does not sustain violations. By fully implementing the IRFA in accordance with the tenets of responsible engagement, the United States would actively oppose violations rather than engaging Vietnam with the hope that improvements will occur. Moreover, this extreme makeover of current policy would balance the dual interests of improved religious freedom and bilateral relations.","[{""country"":[""United States"",""Vietnam""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

Consequently, their future and survival becomes crucial. Since no organization can survive to the turbulence of the environment without a long term vision of its path, strategy is an essential pillar to its sustainability and sometimes survival, as well as mission accomplishment. In addition, the reliance on external sources makes these organizations compete for limited financial resources. Thus, they need an accurate strategic planning in order to clarify their future direction and create trust among the stakeholders. Conclusions from the study developed in an important group of social solidarity cooperative in Portugal reveal that despite recognizing its importance, these organizations miss some strategic procedures and long term perspective of their activity. They are mainly managed in the short term perspective. This lack of relationship between the long and short term can be overcome by developing the Balanced Scorecard.","[{""country"":[""Portugal""],""data_type"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_use"":""No""}]"

At one level, the qualities of the market lent themselves to such conclusions.

In addition it highlights the potential of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), if properly implemented, to significantly increase the region's competitiveness and to help it attain long-term sustained development. This potential, however, will only be realized if precise trade and competitiveness strategies are crafted to focus primarily on removing the constraints to competitiveness endemic in the region. In addition, and this is a critical element of any newly-devised strategy, is the necessity to revise regional institutional mechanisms and mandates to promote implementation and to take advantage of the market access opportunities presented by successive trade agreements such as the EPA. This report, while highlighting the need for immediate and concrete actions on the part of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member states, also recognizes the responsibility of the donor community in helping to play a catalytic role in supporting trade reform and macroeconomic stability. The aid for trade agenda must seek to address the weaknesses inherent in the formulation and application of international aid policies and implement new frameworks aimed at enhancing the ability of these small nation states to meet and overcome the challenges of global competitiveness.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Today commentators across the political spectrum emphasize America's dominant military capabilities and economic strength. Yet after sixty years of global leadership, the United States is far from universally admired worldwide. A series of polls taken in the winter of 2004 showed that in 16 of 22 countries surveyed, a plurality or majority of the public said that the United States had mainly a negative influence in the world. What is commonly called ""antiAmericanism"" the expression of negative attitudes toward the United States has spread far and wide, including in parts of the world where publics showed deep sympathy with the United States after the 9/11 attacks. The sensitivity of Americans to these expressions of dislike may say as much about America as about others' views of the United States. Alexis de Tocqueville commented on this subject in the mid 19th century: “The Americans, in their intercourse with strangers, appear impatient of the smallest censure and insatiable of praise... They unceasingly harass you to extort praise, and if you resist their entreaties they fall to praising themselves. It would seem as if, doubting their own merit, they wished to have it constantly exhibited before their eyes”. The undeniable upsurge in the expression of anti-American sentiment abroad since 2002 has led to anxieties among many Americans. It is not obvious, however, whether these sentiments are primarily a reaction to the Bush administration and its policies or whether they derive from more fundamental sources.

Recent research applying the theory of endogenous sunk fixed costs to the banking industry suggests that the current focus of bank antitrust policy on this trade-off may be misplaced. According to initial results obtained by work along these lines, the presence of endogenous sunk fixed costs arising from non-price competition among banks on the basis of product quality yields a lower bound on concentration in banking markets, implying that a few large banks typically will predominate.

We propose an optimized multi-criteria screening approach to identify best performing designs, i.e., the selection, size and operating rules of new reservoirs within multi-reservoir systems. Reservoir release operating rules and storage sizes are optimized concurrently for each separate infrastructure design under consideration. Outputs reveal system trade-offs using multi-dimensional scatter plots where each point represents an approximately Pareto-optimal design. The method is applied to proposed Blue Nile River reservoirs in Ethiopia, where trade-offs between total and firm energy output, aggregate storage and downstream irrigation and energy provision for the best performing designs are evaluated. This proof-of concept study shows that recommended Blue Nile system designs would depend on whether monthly firm energy or annual energy is prioritized. 39 TWh/yr of energy potential is available from the proposed Blue Nile reservoirs. The results show that depending on the amount of energy deemed sufficient, the current maximum capacities of the planned reservoirs could be larger than they need to be. The method can also be used to inform which of the proposed reservoir type and their storage sizes would allow for the highest downstream benefits to Sudan in different objectives of upstream operating objectives (i.e., operated to maximize either average annual energy or firm energy). The proposed approach identifies the most promising system designs, reveals how they imply different trade-offs between metrics of system performance, and helps system planners asses the sensitivity of overall performance to the design parameters of component reservoirs.","[{""country"":[""Ethiopia""],""data_type"":[""Other Source of Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

We begin with the global testing problem, where the goal is to detect the existence of sparse signals in a data set, and then move to the problem of estimating the proportion of nonnull effects. Finally, we focus on multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control. The FDR provides a powerful and practical approach to large-scale multiple testing and has been successfully used in a wide range of applications. We discuss several effective data-driven procedures and also present efficient strategies to handle various grouping, hierarchical, and dependency structures in the data.","[{""country"":[""Not Applicable""],""data_type"":[""Survey Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"

Their importance is overwhelming in how the interests of local or national communities will be managed for a good period of time. Stagnation, prosperity, or economic, social or political regression depend on those who temporarily occupy the representative functions as they result from the establishment and validation of the election result. As far as the European Parliament elections are concerned, they took place in 2014, the next being in 2018. The question we raise is related to the electoral threshold and its necessity, given the existence of a proportional electoral system. The electoral law sets a 5% electoral threshold in Romania, and independent candidates can be assigned mandates if they each have a valid number of votes at least equal to the national electoral coefficient. The national electoral coefficient represents the full part of the ratio between the total number of votes validly expressed and the number of European parliamentary mandates belonging to Romania. Abolishing the electoral threshold would create a better representation in the European Parliament and smaller parties, and this would bring about a balance. We do not opt for its annulment, but we believe that a diminution of this electoral threshold may be a welcome legislative measure.","[{""country"":[""Romania""],""data_type"":[""Administrative Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]"
