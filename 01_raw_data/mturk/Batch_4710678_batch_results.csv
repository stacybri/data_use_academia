In addition to these 11 families already diagnosed with HNPCC, 3 new families with germ line mutations of hMSH2 gene and hMLH1 gene were found through analysis of DNA from patients who had multiple cancers with alteration in microsatellite DNA.

In this paper, we address speculation that apple snails respond to decreasing water levels and potential drying events by moving toward refugia that remain inundated. We monitored the movements of apple snails in central Florida, USA during drying events at the Blue Cypress Marsh (BC) and at Lake Kissimmee (LK). We monitored the weekly movements of 47 BC snails and 31 LK snails using radio-telemetry. Snails tended to stop moving when water depths were 10 cm. Snails moved along the greatest positive depth gradient (i.e., towards deeper water) when they encountered water depths between 10 and 20 cm. Snails tended to move toward shallower water in water depths ≥50 cm, suggesting that snails were avoiding deep water areas such as canals and sloughs. Of the 11 BC snails originally located in the area that eventually went dry, three (27%) were found in deep water refugia by the end of the study. Only one of the 31 LK snails escaped the drying event by moving to deeper water. Our results indicate that some snails may opportunistically escape drying events through movement. The tendency to move toward deeper water was statistically significant and indicates that this behavioral trait might enhance survival when the spatial extent of a dry down is limited. However, as water level falls below 10 cm, snails stop moving and become stranded. As the spatial extent of a dry down increases, we predict that the number of snails stranded would increase proportionally.

K+?activates over 50 enzymes critical for numerous metabolic processes, including photosynthesis, oxidative metabolism and protein synthesis (Marschner 1995). Within the cytosol, K + neutralizes the soluble and insoluble macromolecular anions and stabilizes the pH at the level optimal for most enzymatic reactions (pH ∼7.2). Thus, cytosolic K + homeostasis is crucial to optimal cell metabolism. In contrast to K + , Na + is not essential for plants (Marschner 1995). For the majority of crop species, Na + is toxic at mM concentrations in the cytosol. With cytosolic K + concentrations being around 150 mM (Leigh and Wyn Jones 1984; Leigh 2001) and cytosolic Na + in a lower mM range (Carden et al. 2003), the cytosolic K + /Na + ratio is high, enabling many K + -dependent metabolic processes to proceed (Rubio et al. 1995; Maathuis and Amtmann 1999). Under saline conditions, cytosolic Na + levels increase dramatically, estimates varying from 10 to 30 mM, up to 200 mM (Koyro and Stelzer 1988; Flowers and Hajibagheri 2001; Carden et al. 2003). At the same time, cytosolic K + content decreases dramatically. An almost 2-fold decrease in cytosolic K + activity was measured in salinized roots of barley (Carden et al. 2003), and cytosolic K + activity as low as 15 mM in epidermal leaf cells has been reported (Cuin et al. 2003). Thus the cytosolic K + /Na + ratio falls dramatically under saline conditions, severely impairing cell metabolism (Maathuis and Amtmann 1999; Flowers and Hajibagheri 2001; Munns 2002). Not surprising, the ability to maintain a high cytosolic K + /Na + ratio has often been cited as a key feature in plant salt tolerance (Gorham et al. 1990; Maathuis and Amtmann 1999; Tester and Davenport 2003; Chen et al. 2005). Within the vacuole, K + mediates osmoregulation, and within specialized cells, stomatal movements and tropisms. Here the K + concentration is much more flexible and can be more readily replaced by other cations, including Na + (Leigh et al. 1986). However, the vacuolar PP-ase is critically dependent on K + for both hydrolytic activity and H + pumping (White et al. 1990). Thus, even in this organelle, maintenance of a minimal level of K + is vitally important for optimal plant performance. How is this achieved? Molecular and ionic mechanisms of K + transport have been the subject of a large number of comprehensive reviews in recent years (Maathuis and Amtmann 1999; Maathuis and Sanders 1999; Tyerman and Skerrett 1999; Schachtman 2000; Mser et al. 2001; Vry and Sentenac 2002, 2003; Shabala 2003) so are only briefly revised in our review. Many important questions, however, remain to be answered. It is not clear how the levels and ratios of K + to Na + are maintained within the plant, and why these ratios are different in cells within various plant tissues. It is also remains to be answered how plants distinguish between K + and Na + , both at the root and cellular levels. This latter problem is not trivial, due to the similarity in ionic radius and ion hydration energies for K + and Na + (Hille 1992), factors which determine both the ion transport mode and the competition for enzyme binding sites within the cytosol. Despite a recent plethora of research (Apse et al. 1999, 2003; Hasegawa et al. 2000; Zhu 2000, 2003; Zhang and Blumwald 2001), we are still lacking full knowledge of the signal-transduction pathways involved in K + homeostasis and maintenance of the critical K + /Na + ratios under salt stressed conditions. This review addresses some of the above issues and summarizes molecular and electrophysiological evidence regarding mechanisms regulating K + homeostasis in salinized plant tissues. The main emphasis is made on the integration of K + transport mechanisms at various levels of plant structural organization.",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:81210160,"[{""country"":[""World""],""data_type"":[""Laboratory Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]",,

The proposed two antennas system consists of a regular full functional five-port receiver for data reception attached to one antenna and one additional path with a second antenna for direction finding. Other than in conventional smart antenna systems the second path does not provide the entire complex signal information hut only a power value. Direction of arrival (DOA) information can be retrieved from comparing the power at the additional port with any of the power readings from the five-port device. This allows to reduce hardware expenses on smart antenna systems. For field applications additional antennas can be easily included in the set-up to increase accuracy and reliability.,https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27094494,"[{""country"":[""United Kingdom"",""United States""],""data_type"":[""Geospatial Data"",""Sensor Data""],""data_use"":""Yes""}]",,
