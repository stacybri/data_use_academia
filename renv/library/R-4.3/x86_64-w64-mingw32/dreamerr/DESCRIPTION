Description: Set of tools to facilitate package development and make R a more user-friendly place. Mostly for developers (or anyone who writes/shares functions). Provides a simple, powerful and flexible way to check the arguments passed to functions. 
    The developer can easily describe the type of argument needed. If the user provides a wrong argument, then an informative error message is prompted with the requested type and the problem clearly stated--saving the user a lot of time in debugging.
