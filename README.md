 Measuring data use in academia for SPI project

## Repo Organization

The repo contains a set of folders and files.  The repo is organized as follows.  

01_raw_data - contains raw data for the project.  This raw data is not generally to be modified by any programs in this repo, only read in by programs and any modified data goes in the 03_outputs folder

02_programs - contains scripts for data cleaning/analysis

03_outputs - contains final outputs from the data cleaning and analysis scripts

## Background

International donors have recognized the important role that national statistical systems play in producing high quality data related to development, such as in producing censuses, surveys, indicators, and in providing users data services. According to PARIS21, the international community funded around $2 billion in statistical development activities between 2016 and 2018 (Paris21 (2020)). The World Bank alone has funded $610 million for those activities in that period.  These investments are typically justified as a means to improve evidence-based policy making in low- and middle-income countries.

Academia plays a key role in producing evidence-based policy recommendations and is a strong beneficiary of the existence of productive national statistical systems. High quality population censuses, for instance, are key for producing a representative sample in a survey that is part of a research study. Microdata produced by the national statistical system in the form of household income and expenditure surveys, agriculture surveys, or demographic and health surveys are routinely used as part of academic studies. A dysfunctional system that is not producing the key data sources or indicators, does not follow basic international classifications to make data comparable, or does not have the data services in place to connect users of the data to the products that are produced, may have less engagement by academia and consequently have a deficit in research on problems facing the country.

The World Bank recognized the importance of academia as a user of the national statistical system in the recently released Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI). The SPI framework assesses the maturity and performance of national statistical systems in five key areas referred to as pillars (Dang et al. (2021)). The first pillar is on data use. It considers the extent that a national statistical system produces products that are meeting the needs of users, and one of the dimensions of this pillar is on data use by academia. However, as acknowledged in the report, measures of data use by academia are in an embryonic stage. Without measures highlighting deficiencies in the usage of data, it is difficult to spotlight problem areas, and countries may lack the information needed to prioritize investments in statistics.

Advances in Natural Language Processing, based on machine learning, and new data sources have opened up new approaches to measuring academic data use at low costs. Organizations have digitized millions of research papers produced around the world and opened up APIs for accessing the raw text of these documents. Natural Language Processing algorithms have been developed to efficiently parse millions of documents to classify documents. 

Using these tools, we propose to develop a methodology for measuring data use by academia. These measures will then be used to study the relationship between products produced by the national statistical system and research output.

### Research questions

The project seeks to answer the following questions:

    i.	What is a feasible way to create a metric of data use by academia?
    ii.	What is the relationship between activities of the national statistical system and academic output?
