"55849833","Upward only rent reviews versus indexation: an investigation into the impact of differing mechanisms upon market efficiency within the commercial real estate sector","The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the traditional, upward-only rent review clauses in English commercial leases can be replaced by rent indexation. Analysis of the existing literature found widespread criticism of upward-only rent reviews. Most importantly, they represent a disadvantage for tenants and an advantage for landlords. Contrary to this, analysis of the qualitative data, gathered through semi-structured interviews with professionals, showed that property market forces have shifted. This leaves tenants in a stronger negotiation position. A clear trend towards shorter leases and break options as opposed to rent review mechanisms. The evidence within the study suggests that the Codes of Leasing Practice have not had a significant impact on the flexibility of commercial leases. The findings of the study indicate that the Government should not legislate against upward-only rent reviews as this could have major negative impacts on the property market. Indexation was found to be a fair and reasonable option for both landlords and tenants. However, the exclusive use of indexation in commercial leases would lead to a distortion of the property market as the determination of market rents and values would be impossible. The principal conclusion of this dissertation was that the self-adjustment of the market, which led to a higher flexibility in commercial leases, made a restriction of upward-only rent reviews unnecessary. Moreover, rent indexation is a well-established rent review mechanism in England – a tool whereby both parties can benefit. An exclusive use of indexation in commercial leases though seems most unlikely.",2011,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55849833","Business",0.1,2577,0.02729236830399695,21356,500
"169816487","Investing and trading in strategic resources for academic data services: A case study","While the meaning of “data” and its role in the research process has shifted numerous times over the past few decades, the role of the academic data librarian has remained focused on helping faculty and students access, use, and preserve all aspects of this distinctive class of information in support of the creation of new knowledge. At the same time, rapid advances in information technology, the explosive growth of digital data, and new methods of scholarly communication have collectively transformed data services in libraries, by impacting their operations, functions, and even their mission. Today, data librarianship is a field of knowledge that can require specific expertise in network technologies, information architecture, metadata, data structuring, text and data mining, data cleaning, manipulation, analysis and visualization, coding, data metrics, data management and data curation, data literacy and data ethics. As a consequence, library services related to research data continue to be a developing area where the responsibilities and practices of data librarianship within academic libraries are generally not yet firmly established. ::: This paper offers an overview of the strategic planning and establishment of research data services within a Canadian university campus library. The University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC) Library is located on the eastern edge of the City of Toronto, one of three campuses that make up the larger University of Toronto system. Primarily an undergraduate community, students, faculty, and staff have access to library resources and services across all three campuses, including a centrally located Map and Data Library. The main challenges facing the UTSC Library are: 1. to develop high-quality research data services that would meet the current needs of faculty and students in alignment with the pre-existing services of the main campus Library; 2. to build awareness and use of these services; 3. to generate support, excitement, and engagement of librarians and staff within the UTSC Library; 4. to work with librarians and staff to build the knowledge and skills needed to ensure the scalability and sustainability of UTSC's data services; 5. to be flexible enough to respond to future development opportunities in an area that is continuously shifting and expanding. ::: The authors of this paper will describe the process of developing research data services at the UTSC Library, beginning from the creation (proposal stage) of a data librarian position, hiring and staffing, development of a mandate in alignment with the Library’s mission, to the first stages of implementation and assessment. We will discuss how these activities integrate into the wider context of the UTSC Library’s user services and functional departments, specifically the Digital Scholarship Unit (DSU) and the Liaison Librarian Program. Additionally, as one of three campuses which span the Greater Toronto Area, we will discuss the role of data services at a smaller, undergraduate campus in relation to University of Toronto Libraries main campus data services and, in particular, what distinct value and services a smaller-sized library data service can contribute to the research community, as well as future developments in the field of data librarianship.",2017,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169816487","Business",0.1,2577,0.02729236830399695,21356,500

Using a sample of US financial institutions over the period 2003-2009 we document that CEOs with high equity incentives have systematically engaged in securitization transactions to a larger extent than CEOs with low incentives. We also show that CEOs with high equity and risk-related incentives have engaged in the securitization of risky loans and have used securitization for transferring risks to outside investors. Finally, we show that executives incentivized on risk have provided outside investors with low quality disclosure about losses recorded on securitized loans thus contributing to increase the opacity of securitization transactions undertaken. Overall, we interpret our results as evidence that CEOs have foreseen in securitizations under US GAAP an opportunity for hiding risks while bearing them and generating profits and cash flows because of the risks.

"119276372","Optimal Contract with Moral Hazard for Public Private Partnerships","AbstractPublic–Private Partnership (PPP) is a contract between a public entity and a consortium, in which the public outsources the construction and the maintenance of an equipment (hospital, university, prison ...). One drawback of this contract is that the public may not be able to observe the effort of the consortium but only its impact on the social welfare of the project. We aim to characterize the optimal contract for a PPP in this setting of asymmetric information between the two parties. This leads to a stochastic control under partial information and it is also related to principal-agent problems with moral hazard. Considering a wider set of information for the public and using martingale arguments in the spirit of Sannikov, the optimization problem can be reduced to a standard stochastic control problem, that is solved numerically. We then prove that for the optimal contract, the effort of the consortium is explicitly characterized.

"168186886","Misbehavior and Mistake in Bankruptcy Mortgage Claims: Some Caveats Regarding the Porter Study","This Article reviews the comprehensive empirical study of the bankruptcy mortgage foreclosure process conducted by Professor Katherine Porter and subsequently published in 2008 in the Texas Law Review. The results of her study, which analyzed 1,768 proof of claim submissions filed in a sample of 1,733 Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, strongly suggest that there is a pervasive failure on the part of mortgage creditors to meet all of the formal documentation requirements for filing such bankruptcy claims. This documentation failure arguably impedes many mortgage debtors or bankruptcy trustees from reviewing these claims for their accuracy.Porter's conclusion that the itemization statements included in even formally complete proof of claim filings are often confusing enough to prevent debtors and trustees from meaningfully evaluating their accuracy, however, is less well grounded. In addition, her data does not unambiguously support her conclusion that there is likely widespread and cumulatively significant overcharging of mortgage debtors being facilitated by these proof of claim documentation deficiencies. These data results are also consistent with more benign explanations of the pervasive discrepancies she identifies between creditors' and debtors' perceptions of the amounts owing. Porter's recommendations for reforms in the bankruptcy mortgage foreclosure process consequently cannot be properly assessed without further research establishing the extent of such creditor abuse.",2012,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168186886","Business",0.1,2577,0.02729236830399695,21356,500
"129197982","Energy issues and sustainable development in Turkey","There is increasing consensus in both the scientific and political communities that significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are necessary to limit the magnitude and extent of climate change. Renewable energy systems already reduce GHG emissions from the energy sector, although on a modest scale. Most long-term energy projections show that renewable energy will play a major role in the global energy supply in the second half of the century, with capacity increasing gradually in the first three decades. On the other hand, Turkey is heavily dependent on expensive imported energy resources (oil, gas and coal) that place a big burden on the economy and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey’s geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources.

"56217378","The State of the Judiciary: A Corporate Perspective","The rule of law depends on highly talented, independent judges who conscientiously strive to ensure that the law is consistently applied in a principled and predictable manner This Essay addresses two potential threats to judicial independence and the rule of law that we believe warrant special attention at this time. First, inadequate judicial salaries pose a threat to the quality and independence of the judiciary. Judges' real pay has declined substantially over the past generation, even as the compensation of other callings within the legal profession has risen dramatically. This growing disparity in pay has prompted an increasing number of experienced judges to leave the bench and has discouraged many of our most talented and experienced lawyers from accepting judicial nomination. Furthermore, as judicial compensation has declined, judicial appointees have increasingly come to the bench from the public rather than the private sector This trend likely does not bode well for a balanced judiciary. We believe that judicial compensation should be increased substantially at both the federal and state levels. Second, the central role the jury has come to play in American tort law undermines the consistency and predictability that are the hallmarks of the rule of law. When juries, rather than judges, determine basic issues of liability as opposed to resolving issues of fact, similarly situated litigants may receive widely varying results from different juries. In addition, empirical studies indicate that juries treat corporate defendants differently from similarly situated individual defendants, holding corporations to a higher standard of care and assessing significantly higher damages against corporations when they find liability. The direct and indirect costs of such inconsistent and discriminatory treatment harm not only corporations, but also employees, shareholders, and consumers. Judges can and should play a greater role in resolving liability questions in tort disputes in order to restore clarity, consistency, predictability, and accountability to this area of the law.",2007,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56217378","Business",0.1,2577,0.02729236830399695,21356,500

It follows with a critical assessment of the MCD. The methodology of this study is both descriptive and analytical, law is considered not only a normative system but also a set of policy instruments influenced by other disciplines (ie. economics). The findings lead both to optimism and to criticism. Although the European harmonization represents a further step ahead in the area of financial services and consumer protection, some critical questions are still forgotten or left aside.

"55912074","Efficient and service oriented infrastructure operation: the role of the Energy Efficiency Directive in driving change towards Multi Utility Service Companies","Infrastructure operation can be described as separate utility systems provisioning unconstrained demand, with higher throughput corresponding to higher profits. In contrast, an efficiency perspective would prioritize coordinated infrastructure operation focused on essential service delivery at the lowest possible resource use. We investigate how to accelerate the adoption of alternative infrastructure operation configurations which are: centred on the end-user and their demand for services; concerned with resource efficiency improvements; and consider multiple infrastructure streams. We call these alternative modes of operation Multi-Utility Service Companies (MUSCos). Market and system failures, that arise in privatised utility systems, present barriers to the adoption of MUSCos. This paper categorises these barriers and investigates the extent to which the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) overcomes them. The EED is analysed because energy is required to deliver the majority of household infrastructure services and as a result energy policy will have influence over the related infrastructure systems. Our research finds that the EED could increase adoption of service-oriented contracts in the public sector, potentially resulting in spillover to the domestic and commercial sector. However, without changes to accounting practices, financial instruments and standardisation of contracts, investment risks and transaction costs would remain high and it is unlikely that this spillover would occur. In addition, the continued fragmentation of policy and cross-sector information asymmetries augments existing barriers to more integrated infrastructure operation. We describe additional measures that might overcome these weaknesses; including measures to reduce contractual barriers and risks in the domestic sector, provide more appropriate financing and accounting arrangements and more explicitly address the interconnectivity of infrastructure systems in future policy.",2013,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55912074","Business",0.1,2577,0.02729236830399695,21356,500
"167712227","Human Resources practices and workplace environmental support","phone: 011-6520366 Abstract. The key to retaining employees lies on the organization's capability of supporting employees by understanding and answering to their intrinsic motivators. It is important for employees to perceive a positive and valuing attitude of the organization toward them in order to have greater motivation for staying in the organization. Such condition for employee retention is based on the social exchange theory which holds that the exchange relationship between employer and employee goes beyond exchange of impersonal resources such as money, information, and service. One of the leading challenges in creating attractive and supporting working environment has be implementing effective human development strategies to enhance organizational performance and employee commitment. Therefore, managing human resources plays a crucial role in a process of increasing organization, starting from line managers who need to be aware of factors that motivate their subordinates to make them perform well, ending up with human resources professionals who have to understand motivation to effectively design and implement reward structure and systems. In employment situation, as in personal relationships, commitment is a tow-away street. If employers want committed employees, they need to be committed employers. Committed employees do better work than uncommitted ones and organizations with committed workers do better financially than organizations with uncommitted ones. Employers need to determine what is responsible for this disparity. Many employees perceive that employers do not value loyalty and are willing to sacrifice workers to maintain the financial bottom line. Employees points to decades of downsizing, rightsizing, and re-engineering as the evidence that employers treat them as expendable commodities when times get tough (Bragg, 2002).",2016,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167712227","Business",0.1,2577,0.02729236830399695,21356,500

Particularly for small business, this great challenge becomes a barrier for organizational development and results rather in a survival strategy with low organizational performance. In the same time it is essential to create friendly conditions for small business development and small business growth because these kinds of companies are the employers for local communities and hence they contribute to a reduction of the national unemployment rate for global economy. However these conditions are possible to shape when knowing the determinants of organizational performance.

"197893023","Assessing barriers to reuse of electrical and electronic equipment, a UK perspective","Abstract This paper reports on research undertaken to identify generic and specific barriers to reuse of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from across the value chain including product designers, manufacturers, users and waste managers as well policy makers and academics. The interviews sought to examine perceived and real barriers to reuse in the UK. Three inter-connected factors that limit opportunities and instances of reuse of electrical and electronic equipment were identified, highlighting that both systemic and consumer barriers to increasing levels of reuse exist. These are: producer reluctance, unsuitable collection infrastructure and cultural issues. Overall, the paper shows that low levels of reuse in the electrical and electronic sector are a result of complex and interlinked barriers. Understanding these connections offers the potential to improve the opportunities for reuse, by providing direction for policy makers to address barriers from a multi stakeholder perspective. Increasing instances of reuse is essential if the UK is to successfully move towards a resource efficient, circular economy.",2019,"Resources, Conservation & Recycling: X","10.1016/j.rcrx.2019.100004",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197893023","Business",0.1,2577,0.02729236830399695,21356,500

WOM seems particularly important to the marketing of services. This is because services are experiential in nature and difficult to assess before purchase. In the restaurants context there is little research on WOM. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that may influence tourists’ WOM about restaurants implying on the critical role of relationship quality. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Design/methodology/approach ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: A comprehensive literature review is conducted to identify the major factors influencing WOM in the context of restaurant industry. The study utilizes self-administered questionnaire survey and the target population are the customers who have referred to the restaurants of Tehran, Iran. A convenience sampling approach was utilized to collect a sample of 326 customers. A structural equation modeling procedure is applied to the examination of the antecedents of WOM. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Findings ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: The paper found that food quality, personal interaction quality, physical environment quality, and perceived value influence WOM behavior of customer in an indirect way through relationship quality. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Practical implications ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: This research conjectured that an understanding of factors that influence the tourist to talk each other about a given restaurant are worthy of additional research. Consequently, the study helps to understand how these factors can provide alternative sources of marketing to attract the long-term economic sustainability of restaurant industry in Iran. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Originality/value ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: To the authors’ knowledge, this research will be the first attempt to explore influential factors on WOM in restaurant industry focusing on the critical role of relationship quality.

"6241751","Measuring and managing the quality of transportation at Acadia National Park.","In response to increased use of parks and outdoor recreation related areas, transportation legislation passed in 1998 required the Departments of Transportation and Interior to assess transportation needs and develop planning procedures for congestion management in parks and on public lands. One year later, the National Park Service responded by publishing its Transportation Planning Guidebook. This publication used a number of case studies to illustrate a range of park management strategies for addressing traffic congestion. A common theme throughout the guidebook was implementation of alternative transportation systems, including shuttle buses and bicycle/pedestrian facilities, in addition to roads. Together, this integrated infrastructure and the forms of transportation accommodated are known as multimodal transportation networks. These networks provide managers opportunities to disperse visitor use over space and time, a strategy for addressing congestion and crowding. As this strategy is more widely used, multimodal transportation is an increasingly important component of the experience of visitors to national parks and related areas. While conventional transportation planning uses a levels of service (LOS) framework to measure and manage many modes of transportation, it lacks measures of visitor experience critical in park and outdoor recreation contexts. Indicators and standards of quality, a framework widely used in the field of park and outdoor recreation management, give explicit consideration to visitor perspectives and incorporate them into management. Using Acadia National Park as a study site, this paper illustrates that LOS and indicators and standards of quality can be integrated to provide a more holistic approach to transportation management in park and outdoor recreation contexts. Furthermore it develops a series of potential standards for density of use on roads, in shuttle buses, and along shared-use paths.

Despite this commitment, significant gaps exist in the national HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. To identify these gaps and opportunities for improvement, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded the Strengthening HIV Strategic Information in Kenya project, which conducted an organizational HIV M&E capacity rapid needs assessment (RNA). METHODS: The project included an in-depth desk review of national documents, policies, tools, and international best practices. National, regional, and district officials from government agencies, development partners, and implementing partners participated in key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Given the large number of regions and districts, purposive sampling was used to select 16 facilities in 8 districts across 2 regions based on the general quality of the reported HIV data and the number of partners supporting the regions. RESULTS: RNA findings revealed tremendous improvements at the national level and in the various subsystems that contribute to the overall HIV strategic information. There also were significant gaps, including in a lack of M&E guidelines, parallel reporting systems, feedback given to subnational levels, and data use and general data management and use capacity at subnational levels. CONCLUSION: An urgent need exists for the development of national M&E guidelines and a comprehensive training curriculum. To ensure success further, capacity building for subnational levels should be conducted and feedback channels to subnational staff should be established and maintained.",2013,"The Pan African Medical Journal","10.11604/pamj.2013.14.129.2581",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18911985","Business",0.1,2577,0.02729236830399695,21356,500

A recent development in the field of herbal Medicine and food Additives is to counterfeit these products by adding prescription-only (Rx) active or other chemical defined ingredients which are not labeled on the packaging. As a result, customers who consume these products, thinking that they contain herbal ingredients only, are taking Rx substances without awareness about the risk of side effects.

"155636727","THE REGIME OF BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES BETWEEN GREECE AND NON EU COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE: THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NECESSARY REFORM","The Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) concluded mainly between developed and developing countries are the main instrument of international investment protection. The EU Member States have concluded with third countries about half of the above agreements which provide, as is well known, primarily for the establishment of standards of treatment of foreign investors and foreign investment in the territory of the host state. Among them, Greece is a contracting party to bilateral agreements of this kind with most countries of Southern and Eastern Europe which are not EU members. These agreements have some key features common to all BITs. The EU member states BITs will gradually be replaced through a long process, by EU Investment Agreements in the framework of the implementation of the new comprehensive EU policy in the field of international investment. The development of this policy is founded on new competences conferred by the Treaty of Lisbon to the EU in this field. Until the aforementioned replacement process is completed, transitional arrangements are in force at EU level. These rules define the conditions according to which the existing member states BITs may continue to apply. Moreover they allow these sates to opt to modify their BITs by setting the conditions under which they may be authorized to do so. In view of this development, the present study attempts to identify and analyze the main negative elements of the main provisions of BITs concluded by Greece, mainly in the 1990s, with third countries of Southeastern Europe. At the same time suggestions to improve these provisions are formulated, so as to achieve the difficult and delicate balance between the protection of foreign investment and the need to ensure the right for regulatory intervention by the host states.",2015,"Scientific Bulletin – Economic Sciences",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155636727","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"154408213","Trade integration,restructuring and global imbalances --A tale of two countries","China is widely seen as one of the sources of global macroeconomic imbalances. Its persistent current account surplus and capital exports to the United States are even cited as one of the causes of the global financial crisis. The most common explanation traces China's current account surplus to a mismatch between saving and investment due to inefficiently low domestic demand. We challenge this explanation. Our argument rests on an analogy that we construct between two countries generally thought to be very different: Russia and China. Russia, a raw materials exporting country, has been running current account surpluses similar to China's in relation to GDP. As for most raw materials exporting countries this is considered normal, reflecting efficient reinvestment of wealth from natural resources in financial assets. We show that a similar efficiency argument can be constructed for China, although the nature of wealth that is reinvested in financial assets is different in the two countries. Our analysis implies that China's current account surpluses can be expected to disappear over the long horizon – although the time when this will happen may still be very far away. Moreover, an appreciation of the Chinese currency may not have the desired effect of mitigating the country's current account surplus as a weakening in competitiveness is counterbalanced by a strengthening of investment motives.",2011,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:154408213","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

The argument has been established that financial markets are sensitive to CR announcements, and market reactions to such announcements (both upgrading and degrading) are not the same. Using the framework of an autoregressive distributed lag setting, the present study attempted to empirically test the linear and non-linear impacts of CR on financial market development (FMD) in the European region. Nonlinear specification is capable to capture asymmetries (upgrades and downgrades) in the estimation process, which have not been considered to date in financial market literature. Overall findings identified long-term asymmetries, while there was little evidence supporting the existence of short-term asymmetries. Thus, the present study has extended the financial market literature on the subject of the asymmetrical impact of a sovereign CR on European FMD and provides useful input for policy formation taking into account these nonlinearities.

As many of the livestock functions as possible (physical and socio-economic) should be aggregated into monetary values and related to the resources used, irrespective of whether these ""products"" are marketed, home-consumed or maintained for later use. A broad evaluation model involving three complementary flock-level productivity indices was applied to evaluate subsistence goat production in eastern Ethiopian highlands. The results showed that indigenous goat flocks generated significantly higher net benefits under improved than under traditional management, which challenges the prevailing notion in countries like Ethiopia that indigenous livestock do not adequately respond to improvements in the level of management.

"7269582","Towards polynomial simplex-like algorithms for market equilibria","In this paper we consider the problem of computing market equilibria in the Fisher setting for utility models such as spending constraint and perfect, price-discrimination. These models were inspired from modern e-commerce settings and attempt to bridge the gap between the computationally hard but realistic separable, piecewise-linear and concave utility model and, the tractable but less relevant linear utility case. While there are polynomial time algorithms known for these problems, the question of whether there exist polynomial time Simplex-like algorithms has remained elusive, even for linear markets. Such algorithms are desirable due to their conceptual simplicity, ease of implementation and practicality. This paper takes a significant step towards this goal by presenting the first Simplex-like algorithms for these markets assuming a positive resolution of an algebraic problem of Cucker, Koiran and Smale. Unconditionally, our algorithms are FPTASs; they compute prices and allocations such that each buyer derives at least a 1/1+e-fraction of the utility at a true market equilibrium, and their running times are polynomial in the input length and 1/e. ::: ::: We start with convex programs which capture market equilibria in each setting and, in a systematic way, convert them into linear complementarity problem (LCP) formulations. Then, departing from previous approaches which try to pivot on a single polyhedron associated to the LCP obtained, we carefully construct a polynomial-length sequence of polyhedra, one containing the other, such that starting from an optimal solution to one allows us to obtain an optimal solution to the next in the sequence in a polynomial number of complementary pivot steps.

However, by building strong institutions, increasing budgets for research, and designing successful policies, rapid development of the governance system resulted in a short span of time. Successful implementation of European-type innovation policies helped to build strong governance as well. This study examines technology and innovation policies and the associated governance system in Estonia with a focus on the post-2000 period. Even though the country is generally accepted as a success story for strengthening its governance, and for the Europeanization of its technology and innovation policy, it still faces major problems. These problems will erode the strong governance system if they remain unsolved. Estonia is coping with relative worsening of the main outputs of technology policies, and the effects of the 2008-2009 economic crisis made the downturn more evident. Hence, defining and evaluating these weaknesses would be valuable for the country in order to pursue rapid development, which peaked in 2007-2008 and has slowed down since.",2015,"Review of European Studies","10.5539/res.v7n7p144",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55133580","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

While this is a remarkable achievement for the region, it must be balanced against a concomitant hindrance of democratic reform. I argue in this paper that ASEAN's nascent security community must be seen as an ‘illiberal peace’. Underlying ASEAN's peaceful community are the same principles that support illiberalism in the region, namely sovereignty and non-interference. While sovereignty has historically been a cherished norm for developing countries, ASEAN lags behind other regions, particularly Latin America, in attempting to reconcile tensions between democratic norms and the respect for sovereignty. This tension is most evident in ASEAN's relations with Myanmar. Recent events indicate that ASEAN's non-interference norm may no longer be sacrosanct, but the association is a long way from shunning illiberal politics for the sake of democratic values.",2006,"Pacific Review","10.1080/09512740600875119",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55205486","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

Capital markets have rated several major energy companies as ‘junk bonds’, which means default risk is substantial from an investor perspective. Arguably, overly tight price regulation and declining credit ratings have pushed the industry into a decade-long downward business cycle, which started even before the Great Recession provided additional challenges. Recommendations are formulated for improving the US energy regulation of the mid and downstream natural gas segments in order to revitalize these key pillars of the energy transition program.

"154819272","Happy degrowth through more amateur economy","Abstract This paper outlines a simple, aggregate, descriptive model of what is here termed a “whole economy”, covering all human involvement in the economy, from ultimate means or ecological sacrifices, to the ultimate ends of human satisfaction. The model embraces not only the formal “professional economy” driven by money, but also the parallel non-paid, voluntary economy, here termed “amateur economy”, driven by peoples’ affective motivations. The input of work to the economy plays an essential role in the paper’s analysis of options for reducing ecological sacrifices. Hence, part of the paper is devoted to a brief historical overview of the role of work, including turning points in the 1930s in the United States, when work sharing was displaced by work creation through consumerism, and, in the post-war economy when GDP became the dominant economic indicator. The paper proposes the aim of a happy and sustainable degrowth for affluent countries, implying the transfer of some activities from the professional economy to the less ‘labor’ productive amateur economy. This will tend to reduce overall labor productivity and hence resource throughput, but increase satisfaction and happiness. A key element in the analysis is combining a reduction in consumption with a reduction in production, which is obtainable through lowering either working time or work productivity and turning some of the leisure time into voluntary activities. Economic growth is not a law of nature but the consequence of explicit political decisions taken. Hence growth is also open to new political decisions in recognition of physical limits to growth and the human quest for replacing economic growth with life satisfaction, including increased free time.",2013,"Journal of Cleaner Production","10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.12.006",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:154819272","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

"34397888","International Tax and Global Justice","Inequality, as well as the scope of the duty of justice to reduce it, has always been a central concern of political justice. Income taxation has been seen as a key tool for redistribution and the state was the arena for discussions of justice. Globalization and the tax competition it fosters among states change the context for the discussion of distributive justice. Given the state’s fading coercive power in taxation and the decreasing power of its citizenry to co-author its collective will due to global competition, we can no longer assume that justice can be realized within the parameters of the state. International tax policy in an effort to retain justice often opts for cooperation as a vehicle to support distributive justice. But cooperation among states is more than a way for them to promote their aims through bargaining. Rather, it is a way for states to regain legitimacy by sustaining their very ability to ensure the collective action of their citizens and to treat them with equal respect and concern. The traditional discussion in international taxation seems to endorse a statist position — implicitly assuming that when states bargain for a multilateral deal, justice is completely mediated by the agreement of the states. In contrast, this Article argues that such a multilateral regime intended to provide the state with fundamental legitimacy requires independent justification. Contrary to the conventional statist position, I maintain that cooperating states have a duty to ensure that the constituents of all cooperating states are not treated unjustly because of the agreement. I argue that not only cosmopolitanism but political justice too requires that a justifiable cooperative regime must improve (or at least not worsen) the welfare of the least well-off citizens in all cooperating states. I explain that cooperation alone is no guarantee of improved welfare and that certain transfer payments between rich and poor countries might be required to ensure this.",2017,"Theoretical Inquiries in Law","10.2139/ssrn.2762110",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:34397888","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"158466885","The eﬀects of migration and pollution externality on cognitive skills in Caribbean economies: a Theoretical analysis","Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face speciﬁc social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities. This paper provides a simple overlapping generations model with migration and intergenerational transfers in an economy where production generates pollution. This pollution hampers the cognitive skills of the children and thus the eﬃciency of human capital accumulation in the economy. Therefore the model developped in this work introduces kea features of Caribbean SIDS in order to exacerbate the dynamics between demography – i.e. migration and human capital accumulation – and pollution. Results reveal that the usual gain from migration in terms of human capital was no longer possible because of the environmental externality. Indeed, in most of the cases, in presence of the environmental externality, per capita variables (utility, production and capital) are decreased by migration, while the aggregated production can be enhanced thanks to the demographic growth that occurs with migration. Moreover, it has been shown that the conditions to have a proﬁtable environmental tax depend on the pollution intensity of the economy. Finally, the interactions between the emigration rate and the form of intergenerational transfers – i.e. solidarity from the domestic area and/or from the diaspora – have an impact on the scale of the reduction of human capital due to migration. Thus, in this model a gain from an increase in the rate of emigration is still possible but only if migration is already very high.",2018,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:158466885","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"13580860","Modeling Internet Security Investments Tackling Topological Information Uncertainty","Modern distributed communication networks like the Internet are characterized by nodes (Internet users) interconnected with one another via communication links. In this regard, the security of individual nodes depend not only on their own efforts, but also on the efforts and underlying connectivity structure of neighboring network nodes. By the term ‘effort', we imply the amount of investments made by a user in security mechanisms like antivirus softwares, firewalls, etc., to improve his security. However, often due to the large magnitude of such networks, it is not always possible for nodes to have complete effort and connectivity structure information about all their neighbor nodes. Added to this is the fact that in many applications, the Internet users are selfish and are not willing to co-operate with other users on sharing effort information. ::: ::: In this paper, we adopt a non-cooperative game-theoretic approach to analyze individual user security in a communication network by accounting for both, the partial information that a network node possess about its underlying neighborhood connectivity structure and security investment of its neighbors, as well as the presence of positive externalities arising from efforts exerted by neighboring nodes. We analyze the strategic interactions between Internet users on their security investments in order to investigate the equilibrium behavior of nodes and show (i) the existence of monotonic symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria of efforts and (ii) better connected Internet users choose lower efforts to exert but earn higher utilities than less connected peers with respect to security improvement when user utility functions exhibit strategic substitutes, i.e, are submodular. Our results extend previous work with respect to tackling topological information uncertainty, and provide useful insights to Internet users on appropriately (from improving payoffs perspective) investing in security mechanisms under realistic environments of effort and topological information uncertainty, in order to improve system security and welfare.

"154846430","How Status Concerns Can Make Us Rich and Happy","This paper considers an overlapping generations model of economic growth populated by two types of individuals. Competitive types compare future consumption (i.e. wealth) with the mean. Self-sufficient types derive utility simply from their own consumption and do not compare themselves with others. I derive a condition under which the utility (happiness) of both types increases when the economy is populated by a larger share of competitive types.

"155512678","Impact of Agricultural innovation on improved livelihood and productivity outcomes among smallholder farmers in Rural Nigeria","Agricultural research programs that are driven by Agricultural Innovation System concepts usually target to change the way in which low income rural agrarian households in a nation like Nigeria communicate with the market and the decision making strategies pertaining to development of their agri-business and the scarce resources which are at their disposal. As a result there has been a shift in the research paradigm in many African countries like Nigeria; from top down research systems to nonlinear dynamic systems that aim to enhance end users capacity to obtain and utilize knowledge and research outputs. The aim of this paper was therefore to assess the extent to which the use of these innovative agricultural research interventions impact upon the livelihood and productivity outcomes of rural smallholder farmers in Nigeria using a case study from the South west region of Nigeria. Using propensity score matching as a means of establishing a valid counterfactual and single differencing to measure impact, the study establishes that rural incomes and output are significantly impacted upon by agricultural research interventions that are driven by agricultural innovation systems concepts. The study however further finds that although participating households had better livelihood and productivity outcomes and more diversified income portfolios during the implementation of the innovative research intervention as a result of greater linkages to markets and capacity building opportunities; phasing out of the research program reduced the diversity of income portfolios and lead to the erosion of livelihoods. The study therefore concluded that agricultural research interventions that are driven by agricultural innovation system concepts have the potential to positively impact upon the livelihood outcomes of rural smallholder farmers in Nigeria however there is need for greater capacity building of local extension agents and increased budgetary support to ensure understanding and application of agricultural innovation system concepts by local level public agricultural extension agents to sustain positive livelihood and productivity outcomes. In addition agricultural innovation system concepts should be mainstreamed in all public agricultural extension and research programs to ensure sustained rural innovation and robust livelihood and improved productivity outcomes.",2016,"Social Science Research Network","10.2139/ssrn.2847537",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155512678","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"35592481","Precontractual Liability and Preliminary Agreements","For decades, there has been substantial uncertainty regarding when the law will impose precontractual liability. The confusion is partly due to scholars' failure to recover the law in action governing precontractual liability issues. In this Article, Professors Schwartz and Scott show first that no liability attaches for representations made during preliminary negotiations. Courts have divided, however, over the question of liability when parties make reliance investments following a ""preliminary agreement."" A number of modern courts impose a duty to bargain in good faith on the party wishing to exit such an agreement. Substantial uncertainty remains, however, regarding when this duty attaches and what the duty entails. Professors Schwartz and Scott develop a model showing that parties create preliminary agreements rather than complete contracts when their project can take a number of forms and the parties are unsure which form will maximize profits. A preliminary agreement allocates investment tasks between the parties, specifies investment timing, and commits the parties only to pursue a profitable project. Parties sink costs in the project because investment accelerates the realization of returns and illuminates whether any of the possible project types would be profitable to pursue. A party to a preliminary agreement ""breaches"" when it delays its investment beyond the time the agreement specifies. Delay will save costs for this party if no project turns out to be profitable and will improve this party's bargaining power in any negotiation to a complete contract. Delay often disadvantages the promisee, and when parties anticipate such strategic behavior, they are less likely to make preliminary agreements. This disincentive is unfortunate because a preliminary agreement often is a necessary condition to the realization of a socially efficient opportunity. Thus, contract law should encourage relation-specific investments in preliminary agreements by awarding the promisee his verifiable reliance if the promisor has strategically delayed investment. Professors Schwartz and Scott study a large sample of appellate cases showing that: (1) parties appear to make the preliminary agreements described in the model and breach for the reasons the model identifies, and (2) courts sometimes protect the promisee's reliance interest when they should, but the courts' imperfect understanding of the parties' behavior sometimes leads them to err. I. INTRODUCTION For at least fifty years, a particular pattern of commercial behavior has engendered considerable litigation and substantial scholarly commentary. Two commercial parties agree to attempt a transaction and agree also on the nature of their respective contributions, but neither the transaction nor what the parties are to do is precisely described, and neither may be written down. The parties do not agree and, indeed, may never have attempted to agree on important terms such as the price. After the parties agree upon what they can, and before uncertainty is resolved, one or both of them make a sunk-cost investment. (1) This pattern of commercial behavior suggests that the parties have made a ""preliminary agreement"" that will have one of two legally significant outcomes: If the transaction turns out to be profitable after uncertainty is resolved, the parties will make their agreement more concrete and then conduct the transaction. But if the transaction turns out to be unprofitable, the parties will abandon the project. Disputes sometimes arise under these preliminary agreements after one or both of the parties have invested. One party may then abandon the project even though the other party protests the first party's exit. In particular, the disappointed party believes that he is entitled to compensation either for his expectation or for his investment cost while the other party believes that she is entitled to exit without liability. A court must then decide whether to protect the promisee's (2) expectation interest, or to protect his reliance interest by reimbursing his sunk cost, or to award him nothing. …",2007,"Harvard Law Review","10.7916/D8T440MF",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35592481","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

This article examines the process of acquiring and internalizing advanced technology and developing Japan’s human resources during that period by applying a model developed by the author. This model analyzes the challenges developing countries currently face with respect to skills development: namely, bridging the three gaps of policy, relevance, and finance of publicly provided skills development. Via a case study of the iron and steel industry, the article describes: how the government made a strategic choice with respect to technology; how the government played the dual roles of direct management of the industry as well as stimulating the growth of private industry; the extent to which the government made conscious efforts to use the existing socio-economic system related to the industry; and how it used local resources without depending on foreign loans. The government initially depended on foreign experts, gradually replacing them with domestic experts who were initially trained abroad but later at home, followed by development of middle-level skilled workers. The article concludes that many of the factors that were key to the success of the countries that grew out of underdevelopment over the last half century were present in the policies and approaches adapted by Japan during the Meiji era.",2010,"Journal of international cooperation in education","10.15027/34375",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54654148","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

This study explores the pattern of specialization in various service activities for 159 Canadian urban areas in 1996, as the basis for a series of maps for the Atlas of Canada. The hierarchical specialization is evaluated for each service sector by computing a regression model of ser-vice employment as a function of urban population and income per capita.

In the other cases, both markets make a more or less equal contribution. All in all, this suggests that bond spreads react only sluggishly to long-term imbalances, as measured by the cointegrating relationship.

"59136418","The emissions gap between the Copenhagen pledges and the 2 °C climate goal: Options for closing and risks that could widen the gap","Abstract As part of the Copenhagen Accord, Annex I Parties (industrialised countries) and non-Annex I Parties (developing countries) have submitted reduction proposals (pledges) and mitigation actions to the UNFCCC secretariat. Our calculations show that if the current reduction offers of Annex I and non-Annex I countries are fully implemented, global greenhouse gas emissions could amount to 48.6–49.7 GtCO 2 eq by 2020. Recent literature suggests that the emission level should be between 42 and 46 GtCO 2 eq by 2020 to maintain a “medium” chance (50–66%) of meeting the 2 °C target. The emission gap is therefore 2.6–7.7 GtCO 2 eq. We have identified a combined set of options, which could result in an additional 2.8 GtCO 2 eq emission reduction. This would lead to an emission level just within the range needed. The options include reducing deforestation and emissions from bunker fuels, excluding emissions allowance increases from land use and forestry rules, and taking into account the national climate plans of China and India. However, there are also important risks that could widen the emissions gap, like lower reductions from countries with only a conditional pledge and the use of Kyoto and/or trading of new surplus emission allowances.",2011,"Global Environmental Change-human and Policy Dimensions","10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.006",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59136418","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

This result, however, does not justify in general the simplifying restriction that warrants or convertible securities are valued as if exercised as a block.

"152741912","Regional Development of Employment and Deconcentration Processes in Eastern Germany. An analysis with an econometric analogue to shift-share techniques","The process of unification of Germany 1989/90 was accompanied by a transformation crisis in the East which severely affected the labour market. Although in East Germany the average loss of employment between October 1989 and June 1993 was 37.7% there were marked re-gional differences. In rural areas this loss was higher (up to a maximum of 49.7%) and lower in city centres (the minimum was 18.1%). In 1998, the average unemployment rate was 21.9%, which varied between 10.0% and 29.2%. Since 1993 there has been a more stable development of regional employment which is analysed in the paper. Theoretical basis is an integration of the product cycle thesis (influ-enced by ideas of Schumpeter, Appelbaum & Schettkat) into a general regional-economic model which is used to explain the destiny of regions. The dynamics of the regions are ex-plained by an interaction of changes of productivity and of product demand. The effects of innovations with respect to the production process are ambivalent, since they are associated with gains of employment if the product demand is elastic, and with employment losses if the demand is inelastic. The data base for the empirical analyses is the employment statistics of East Germany. The regional units are relatively small districts, 114 are defined for Eastern Germany. Data on 28 industries are included. The individual observation is the growth of employment of an indus-try in a region for a specific year (1993-1999) (N = 19152). The method used for the analyses is based on a regression approach which is analogous to shift-share techniques and extends these traditional methods. According to a common criti-cism shift-share analysis is mechanical and deterministic (non-stochastic). Significance tests are not possible since shift-share includes a mechanic decomposition of solely a few effects. An interpretation with respect to causality is problematic. As alternatives several authors (Patterson 1991, Knudsen, Barff 1991, MA¶ller, Tassinopoulos 2000) proposed linear models which allow significance tests and the inclusion of additional explanatory variables.

The distribution and condition of coastal wetlands will change as climate changes. This will create conservation challenges and economic costs, but these can be minimised by drawing from a broad sectoral perspective in undertaking adaptation planning and by ensuring integration into policy. Our review indicates that adaptations to sea level rise that are focussed on wetland and biodiversity conservation are likely to have impacts for urbanisation patterns. Planning regulations that provide spatial buffering around wetlands may give rise to more compact urban forms that may lead to reductions in the cost of defence against sea level rise, reduce energy usage per person and provide more green space. However, more compact urban forms could exacerbate heat island effects and place greater burden on the economically disadvantaged as, for example, single-family homes become more expensive.

The innovation is to work with expected utility preferences that (i) are not time-separable, (ii) exhibit temporal risk aversion, (iii) separate risk aversion from the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, (iv) separate short-run from long-run risk aversion and (v) yield stationary asset pricing implications in the context of an endowment economy.

The findings indicate that gender similarity is beneficial for organizational reputation because it enhances stakeholders' empathy toward the spokesperson. However, this effect is only found when the spokesperson uses an appropriate crisis response strategy based on the guidelines of situational crisis communication theory. More specifically, when a spokesperson offers a rebuild strategy in the context of a preventable crisis, gender similarity results in more empathy toward the spokesperson and, subsequently, in improved organizational reputation.

A New Business Model for Sustainability","European Mediterranean mountain regions have been characterized by a sort of competition between the tourism sector and the agro-silvo-pastoral system, which in recent years has contributed to generate a continuous decline of the second one. Nevertheless, Pasture-based Livestock Farming Systems (PLSFS) are relevant for their role in the management and conservation of large High Nature Value (HNV) farmlands in Europe. The goal of our research is therefore to analyze what are the main features of farming organizations in the Italian alpine mountains and how they may be combined into inovative and sustainable business models (BM), characterized by the coexistence of agro-silvo-pastoral and touristic activities. By drawing upon the BM definition suggested by the Bocken’s et al. (2014), an exploratory case study has been analyzed; in particular, we propose the case study of the Lanzo Valleys, an alpine mountain region in the northwest of Italy, and the Toma di Lanzo Producers Association. The way a concrete and sustainable innovation in the more traditional BM could be supported only by the proactive intervention of a supra-farm dimension, while maintaining the peculiarities of the individual farms, is clearly shown in the article. A system of firms and institutions linked together in a collaborative relationship may represent a strong network, able to achieve the common goal of producing a sustainable development for the territory. Indeed, environment and cultural heritage may be preserved, as well as the economic perspective of farms reinforced, while the PLSFS could become more attractive for the tourism phenomenon.

"155365411","Climate change and sustainable welfare: the centrality of human needs","Since climate change threatens human well-being across the globe and into the future, we require a concept of well-being that encompasses an equivalent ambit. This article argues that only a concept of human need can do the work required. It compares need theory with three alternative approaches. Preference satisfaction theory is criticised on the grounds of subjectivity, epistemic irrationality, endogenous and adaptive preferences, the limitlessness of wants, the absence of moral evaluation and the non-specificity of future preferences. The happiness approach is found equally wanting. The main section shows how these deficiencies can be addressed by a coherent theory of need. Human needs are necessary pre-conditions to avoid serious harm and are universalisable, objective, empirically grounded, non-substitutable and satiable. They are broader than ‘material’ needs since a need for personal autonomy figures in all theoretical accounts. Whilst needs are universal, need satisfiers are most often contextual and relative to institutions and cultures. The satiability and non-substitutability of needs is critical for understanding sustainability. Finally, it is argued that human needs provide an indispensable foundation for many current ethical arguments for global and inter-generational justice in the face of threats from climate change.

Much work on this topic focuses on modelling crop-weather interactions but these models do not generally account for the ways in which socio-economic factors influence how harvests are affected by weather. To address this gap, this paper uses a quantitative harvest vulnerability index based on annual soil moisture and grain production data as the dependent variable in a Linear Mixed Effects model with national scale socio-economic data as independent variables for the period 1990–2005. Results show that rice, wheat and maize production in middle income countries were especially vulnerable to droughts. By contrast, harvests in countries with higher investments in agriculture (e.g. higher amounts of fertilizer use) were less vulnerable to drought. In terms of differences between the world’s major grain crops, factors that made rice and wheat crops vulnerable to drought were quite consistent, while those of maize crops varied considerably depending on the type of region. This is likely due to the fact that maize is produced under very different conditions worldwide. One recommendation for reducing drought vulnerability risks is coordinated development and adaptation policies, including institutional support that enables farmers to take proactive action.",2012,"Food Security","10.1007/s12571-012-0173-4",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17190790","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

THE DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING IN AMERICA","In the United States today, there is at least one credit bureau file, and probably three, for every credit-using individual in the country. Over 2 billion items of information are added to these files every month, and over 2 million credit reports are issued every day. Real-time access to credit bureau information has reduced the time required to approve a loan from a few weeks to just a few minutes. But credit bureaus have also been criticized for furnishing erroneous information and for compromising privacy. The result has been 30 years of regulation at the state and federal levels. ; This paper describes how the consumer credit reporting industry evolved from a few joint ventures of local retailers around 1900 to a high technology industry that plays a supporting role in America's trillion dollar consumer credit market. In many ways the development of the industry reflects the intuition developed in the theoretical literature on information-sharing arrangements. But the story is richer than the models. Credit bureaus have changed as retail and lending markets changed, and the impressive gains in productivity at credit bureaus are the result of their substantial investments in technology. ; Credit bureaus obviously benefit when their data are more reliable, but should we expect them to attain the socially efficient degree of accuracy? There are plausible reasons to think not, and this is the principal economic rationale for regulating the industry.

Economic theory suggests that an economy cannot run persistent current account deficits without depleting its net foreign assets. Nevertheless, for most of the 2000s, the US net foreign liabilities grew at a rate below the one of the cumulative current account deficit. To investigate on the mechanisms that allow the USA to do so, this paper sets up a two-country DGE model with asymmetric liquidity constraints. The model will show that there is a permanent wealth transfer from the world to the USA. The unique position of the USA not only allows them to run persistent current account deficits, but also imposes a permanent decay on the American current account. As the issuer of the world key currency in an asymmetric world monetary system, the USA can make use of Seigniorage and valuation effects to be able to run a continuous current account deficit. These mechanisms work in favour of their net foreign bond holdings, but let their current account further deteriorate.

"156759578","Paving the Delaware Way: Legislative and Equitable Limits On Bylaws After ATP","In ATP Tour, Inc. v. Deutscher Tennis Bund, the Delaware Supreme Court held that a private company’s fee-shifting bylaw was facially valid. And before that decision, Delaware courts similarly upheld companies’ use of forum-selection bylaws requiring that intra-corporate disputes be litigated in a single designated forum. Many interpreted these holdings as broad endoresements of bylaws that could regulate the litigation process itself and a move by the Delaware courts to curtail shareholder litigation. Indeed, the Delaware legislature itself responded to ATP, amending the state’s corporate law to explicitly prohibit Delaware companies from adopting fee-shifting bylaws for shareholder litigation. But the legislature simultaneously allowed Delaware companies to adopt forum-selection bylaws. In this Article, we show that ATP and caselaw related to forumselection bylaws will not result in calamity for investors or provide a silver bullet for companies to end shareholder and securities litigation. Rather, when carefully and fairly read, these decisions simply reaffirm the Delaware Way, under which corporate managers are vested with broad legal authority, but that authority is tempered by principles of equity. Using ATP and fee-shifting bylaws as a point of departure, we provide a template for equitable analysis of not only fee-shifting bylaws, but also forum-selection bylaws and other bylaws relating to litigation. Furthermore, as we argue in this Article, had equitable principles been properly applied to fee-shifting bylaws, equitable principles would have likely prevented fee-shifting bylaws from extinguishing meritorious shareholder or securities litigation anyway. In fact, the only kind of feeshifting bylaw that would likely have survived equitable scrutiny is one   Michael J.

If these supporting policies can be implemented, the AEC’s free movement of skilled labor policy will improve the quality of human resources in ASEAN, especially from lower-middle income countries including Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand. As the results, those six countries are expected to increase the high-skilled employment rates by 0.3 to 1.4 percent and the wage rates up to 10-20 percent in 2025. Thus, the projected increases in the employment and wage rates of ASEAN skilled labor will induce an expansion of the ASEAN economic growth to 7.1 percent in 2025.",2018,"Economics Development Analysis Journal","10.15294/edaj.v6i2.22217",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54777075","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"150572196","Gifts of the Heart… and Other Tissues: Legalizing the Sale of Human Organs and Tissues","""We buy and sell body parts all the time; we just don 't call it that. * I. INTRODUCTION Imagine a scenario in which a young individual tragically dies, but in a way diat preserves almost all of her internal organs.2 Further, imagine that after she is declared brain dead at the hospital, her family decides to donate her organs.3 Despite this magnanimous decision which will save others' lives, the family must bear all expenses for the funeral and other final expenses4 because, under current law, the family is prohibited from receiving anything in compensation for the donation.5 Yet, at the same time, thousands of dollars are changing hands between doctors, hospitals, medical transport companies, and insurance companies in completely legal business transactions for these donated organs.6 This scenario is actually not imaginary at all, but is the established system of organ and tissue transfer under current law. Federal and state laws prohibit the receipt of consideration for an organ donation.7 However, to say that organs are not being bought and sold is to ignore reality.8 While most people are somewhat aware of black market transactions in various human tissues - mostly internal organs - fewer are aware that a massive and legitimate industry has been built around the trade of human remains.9 The same federal and state laws that prohibit donors from receiving compensation for their organs and tissues facilitate this industry by providing recovery of costs to anyone who removes, stores, transports, processes, or transplants the organ or tissue.10 Understandably, these provisions are essential to facilitate organ donations as doctors, hospitals, medical transportation companies, and tissue banks need to earn money to operate. However, given that the demand for organs11 and tissues12 is greater than die supply, diese same doctors, hospitals, and medical companies inflate die costs of dieir ""services"" to capture the entire value of the organ.13 Despite the billions of dollars changing hands in transactions for human tissues and organs,14 the donors themselves are prohibited from receiving any compensation.15 This Comment argues that the donors, as the most rightful owners of the value of dieir organs and tissues, have a right to participate in this industry. The literature advocating the removal of restrictions on human-organ and tissue sales has mostly done so on die grounds diat it is justified by die need to eliminate die organ shortage.16 While this is a valid consideration, it sidesteps die educai objections to die sale of human organs and tissues by arguing that die ends justify die means, and any ediical objections to organ sales are outweighed by die practical need to save lives. In contrast, this Comment attempts to focus more direcdy on the ethical dilemma by considering die question whedier an individual should have die right to claim die value of his or her own body. Ultimately, this Comment concludes diat while strong societal interests justify the prohibition of inter vivos sales, no such interests exist to prevent postmortem transfers. Subsequently, the current law merely transfers wealth from donors to doctors, hospitals, and medical companies and reduces individual autonomy by eliminating the contractual power of donors to control the future use of their organs. Thus, amending die law to allow postmortem organ sales would result in a more equitable legal structure and likely save more lives. Part II of this Comment outlines the current statutory and jurisprudential frameworks surrounding the law's treatment of organ transplantation and the human body more generally. Part III briefly discusses various proposals for organ and tissue sales and their criticisms. Part IV discusses the societal interests supporting the prohibition on organ and tissue sales. Part V analyzes these arguments in light of the current legal structure and argues that an individual should have the right to capture the market value of the rights to her body upon her death since this would provide for a more equitable distribution of wealth and would increase autonomy. …",2012,"BYU Law Review",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150572196","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

The paper has few important findings. First, NJC did not show a significant trend over the last 6 decades, which resulted in a fall in the NJC rate. Second, NJC is very volatile and it may change course even in the span of one month. Third, there is no clear pattern about the co-movement between NJC and the change in the unemployment rate in the U.S. Fourth, the average of total NJC and private NJC since late 2010 are significantly higher than their respective historical averages and the volatility in NJC since the end of the Great Recession is not unusual by historical standards. Fifth, the size of NJC in the first decade of the 21st century has been the lowest along the entire sample.

Short food supply chains (SFSCs) are now widely believed to be more sustainable in comparison to mass food delivery systems. To date, very little quantitative evidence exists on the impacts of various types of food supply chains. Using a cross-sectional quantitative approach, this study assesses the sustainability of distribution channels in short and long food supply chains based on 208 food producers across seven countries: France, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Ten distribution channel types are used in this study. To provide a comprehensive sustainability assessment, a set of economic, social, and environmental indicators are applied. Indicators commonly used in the literature are used, supported by original indicators constructed specifically for the present study. In total, 486 chains are examined and the study confirms that individual producers participate simultaneously in several, short and long chains. Participation in SFSCs is beneficial for producers from an economic perspective. SFSCs allow producers to capture a large proportion of margin otherwise absorbed by different intermediaries. It appears, however, that ’longer’ supply channels generate lower environmental impacts per unit of production when measured in terms of food miles and carbon footprint.

"154817420","Options for sustainable development planning based on “GHGs emissions reduction allocation (GERA)” from a national perspective","Abstract Climate change phenomenon can be seen as a simple but daunting problem. The lack of equity in emission reduction burden sharing regime, will cause a need for a greater sacrifice for poor or less developed countries. Thus, the evaluation of different aspects of equity at a national scale and presenting a top–down model of equity for allocation of GHGs emission (such as GERA) in line with sustainable development is the main objective of this study. In this study, the five equity principles proposed in the literature namely (1) population distribution, (2) GHGs emissions, (3) GDP, (4) trend of economic growth and (5) per capita of carbon productivity as appropriate criteria of equity estimation. Due to the different decision makers' preferences, different weights are allocated to indicators and analyzed. Iran has been considered as a case study, and these criteria were applied at national level to propose an allowance allocation scheme. The result of applying GERA for Iran, at provincial level and under the five equity criteria, determines which provinces have to shoulder higher reduction burdens, and makes a room for less developed provinces for growth. Based on these results, this model demonstrated to be more sensitive to criteria selection rather than to the weight factors. In addition, shifting to low carbon technologies or renewables, careful evaluation of current emission–income pattern, improving of energy intensity and finally, adjustment of secondary industries (manufacturing) based on ecological and natural resources of each region are suggested as the most efficient approaches toward sustainability and green development for the case study.",2015,"Environment, Development and Sustainability","10.1007/s10668-015-9619-0",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:154817420","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

"150796658","The economics of savings bonds","Abstract Series EE Savings Bonds have provided floating rate returns since 1982. They also contain valuable embedded options, including an early redemption option, a guaranteed minimum rate option, and a tax-timing option. Our analysis indicates that the simulated risk-return performance of Savings Bonds has been relatively attractive compared to other default-free assets. Thus, Savings Bonds appear to be worthy of consideration by individual investors. Our regression analysis indicates that, over the 1990 through 2001 period, investors considered both interest rates and economic conditions in their EE Savings Bond purchase and redemption decisions. © 2004 Academy of Financial Services.

Introduction Savings Bonds, sold by the U.S. Treasury since 1935, received a dramatic ""makeover"" in 1982: the coupon rate on Series EE bonds began to float with the market rate on ordinary Treasury notes and bills. Before this change, it was widely assumed that EE bonds offered unattractive returns and that investors should generally avoid them. However, even in their present configuration, which along with floating rates includes several embedded options that add value, there has been no examination of their returns and risk relative to other securities, or to the factors that motivate individual investors to purchase them. In this paper, we have two main objectives. The first, which is of particular interest to individual investors, is to examine how Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds' return and risk compare with other default-risk free securities. The second is to determine whether the demand for Series EE Bonds, which unlike most other securities, can be held only by individuals, responds to interest rates and other economic variables. In section 2, we review the history of the U.S. Savings Bond program. In section 3, we describe the characteristics of current Savings Bonds, and describe the options embedded within them. In section 4, we compare the performance of alternative instruments to a simulated security possessing the same features as current Series EE Bonds. In section 5, we present empirical findings on the relationship between the demand for Series EE Bonds and interest rates and other economic variables. Our conclusions are in section 6. 2. History1 U.S. Savings Bond sales began in March of 1935, "". . . at a time when people's incentives to save-as well as their confidence in financial institutions-had been shaken by the pain of the Great Depression. . . "" (Linehan, 1991). One objective of the program was to broaden the base of public debt by attracting small investors. Designed to be attractive to individual investors, the bonds were sold in small denominations, at a fixed interest rate. A key feature was that they were redeemable after a short period of time, at the purchase price plus accrued interest, eliminating price fluctuations. Another desirable feature was that federal income taxes could be deferred until redemption. Additionally, bonds were issued only in registered form, replaceable in case of loss. Series A through D bonds sold in relatively small amounts through April of 1941, when a new ""Defense"" Savings Bond, the Series E, was introduced.2 After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Savings Bonds sales soared, along with other forms of public debt. Sales rose from $2.5 billion in 1941 to $16.0 billion in 1944, and the proportion of the privately held portion of the public debt comprised by Savings Bonds rose from 6.8% in 1940 to 25.4% in 1951. Savings Bond sales fluctuated moderately over a $4 to $5 billion range over the period from the 1950s through the 1960s, reaching a postwar peak of almost $8 billion in 1978. However, EE yields failed to follow interest rates during the inflationary period of the late 1970s and early 1980s and sales dropped to just $3. …",2004,"Financial Services Review",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150796658","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"11389054","Transferring Ownership of Public Housing to Existing Tenants : A Mechanism Design Approach","This paper explores situations where tenants in public houses, in a specific neighborhood, are given the legislated right to buy the houses they live in or can choose to remain in their houses and pay the regulated rent. This type of legislation has been passed in many European countries in the last 30-35 years (the U.K. Housing Act 1980 is a leading example). The main objective with this type of legislation is to transfer the ownership of the houses from the public authority to the tenants. To achieve this goal, selling prices of the public houses are typically heavily subsidized. The legislating body then faces a trade-off between achieving the goals of the legislation and allocating the houses efficiently. This paper investigates this specific trade-off and identifies an allocation rule that is individually rational, equilibrium selecting, and group non-manipulable in a restricted preference domain that contains ""almost all"" preference profiles. In this restricted domain, the identified rule is the equilibrium selecting rule that transfers the maximum number of ownerships from the public authority to the tenants. This rule is preferred to the current U.K. system by both the existing tenants and the public authority.

"157251303","Farmers' Market or Farmers Market? Examining How Market Ownership Influences Conduct and Performance","Over the last two decades, farmers markets have been widely recognized for their contributions to local economies, support of small-scale farmers, and ability to reconnect consumers and producers of food. Farmers markets vary substantially in both the goals they set and the outcomes they achieve. By conducting a comparative analysis, this study examines whether and how market ownership influences outcomes. Additionally, our study focuses not on determining which ownership type is ""best,"" but on highlighting how markets differ, and more importantly, the limitations that need to be overcome for each type. The research uses Henry Hansmann's (1996) ownership of enterprise framework and Muhammad Yunus's (2010) social business framework to analyze whether differences in ownership lead to variations in market governance, conduct, and performance. Interviews were conducted with managers of Oregon farmers markets representing various ownership structures. Data were analyzed using the inductive thematic analysis approach to understand how ownership influences market goals and mission, general operations, and performance outcomes. The three major market ownership types, vendor-led, community-led, and subentities, have distinct benefits and challenges associated with them. Our findings indicate that vendor-led markets have strong ties back to their vendors but have weaker links to the communities that host the market and are less able to enhance the market by adding activities and pursuing additional fundraising. We found that community-led markets benefit from strong community ties and are often able to draw upon the energy and expertise of board members and volunteers. Their links back to producers depend on vendor representation on the governing body. Finally, markets that function as subentities of broader organizations have the potential for access to greater financial and managerial resources but are often relatively poorly linked to their vendors. These results provide useful insights both for those who are considering starting a market and for those who wish to improve the performance of existing markets.",2015,"The Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development","10.5304/jafscd.2015.061.005",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:157251303","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

A key feature of these programs is that the cash is given to the woman head of household. The rationale stems from previous research in the developing world that transfers to women are more likely to be spent on health, nutrition, and education of children and thus to reinforce the goals of these programs. One concern is that less powerful women may not be as impacted by program funds, because males in those household will decrease their contributions in response to the transfers. Utilizing randomized experimental data from RPS, we test for heterogeneous program impacts on school enrollment and spending based on a woman’s power as proxied by her education relative to her husband . Our results confirm previous findings that generally more household resources are devoted toward children when women are more powerful; however, when women’s power greatly exceeds her husband’s additional female power lowers school enrollment., Additionally we find that RPS’ impacts on schooling are substantially larger than expected income effects estimated from the control group, although we do not find evidence that female power alters RPS impacts on school enrollment. In terms of spending effects, RPS increased food and education expenditures in all households, yet this impact is attributable mostly to income effects.

This study aims to reveal how green space type impacts soil quality and the bacterial community, which finally contributes to suggesting strategies for managing sustainable environments in urban areas. For this purpose, urban green space soils in this study are divided into four different types; park green space (PARK), street green space (STREET), attached green space (ATTACH) and residential green space (RESID). Results showed that significant differences were observed for soil physicochemical properties. Soil organic matter, total nitrogen, soil moisture content and available nitrogen in the ATTACH and PARK soils were significantly higher than in the STREET and RESID soils. Across the four green space types, the structure of bacterial communities was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi at the phylum level. The diversity and richness of bacteria were significantly higher in the PARK and ATTACH soils than in the RESID and STREET soils. Results of principal component analysis (PCoA) showed that soil bacterial communities could be clustered into four different groups according to different green space types. In addition, analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) also implied that soil samples differed significantly from others. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Spearman correlation analysis both showed that the contents of soil organic matter, total nitrogen, soil moisture and pH had great influence on the structures of bacterial communities.

"21641706","Why and how did Israel adopt activity-based hospital payment? The Procedure-Related Group incremental reform","Historically, Israel paid its non-profit hospitals on a perdiem (PD) basis. Recently, like other OECD countries, Israel has moved to activity-based payments. While most countries have adopted a diagnostic related group (DRG) payment system, Israel has chosen a Procedure-Related Group (PRG) system. This differs from the DRG system because it classifies patients by procedure rather than diagnosis. In Israel, the PRG system was found to be more feasible given the lack of data and information needed in the DRG classification system. The Ministry of Health (MoH) chose a payment scheme that depends only on inhouse creation of PRG codes and costing, thus avoiding dependence on hospital data. The PRG tariffs are priced by a joint Health and Finance Ministry commission and updated periodically. Moreover, PRGs are believed to achieve the same main efficiency objectives as DRGs: increasing the volume of activity, shortening unnecessary hospitalization days, and reducing the gaps between the costs and prices of activities. The PRG system is being adopted through an incremental reform that started in 2002 and was accelerated in 2010. The Israeli MoH involved the main players in the hospital market in the consolidation of this potentially controversial reform in order to avoid opposition. The reform was implemented incrementally in order to preserve the balance of resource allocation and overall expenditures of the system, thus becoming budget neutral. Yet, as long as gaps remain between marginal costs and prices of procedures, PRGs will not attain all their objectives. Moreover, it is still crucial to refine PRG rates to reflect the severity of cases, in order to tackle incentives for selection of patients within each procedure.",2016,"Health policy","10.1016/j.healthpol.2016.08.008",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21641706","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

We consider whether the Greenbook, Blue Chip, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters exhibit systematic biases in the manner in which they incorporate interest rate projections into the forecasts of other macroeconomic variables. We do not find strong evidence of systematic biases in the three economic forecasts that we consider, as the interest rate projections in these forecasts appear to be efficiently incorporated into forecasts of other economic variables.",2019,"Social Science Research Network","10.17016/feds.2019.002",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:145815101","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"73635841","The profit function system with output- and input-specific technical efficiency","In a recent paper Kumbhakar and Lai (2016) proposed an output-oriented non-radial measure of technical inefficiency derived from the revenue function. They proposed a closed skew-normal distribution for maximum likelihood estimation but they did not apply the model to data and their technique depends on multiple evaluations of multivariate normal integrals for each observation which can be very costly. In this paper we extend their approach to the profit function and we propose both input- and output-oriented non-radial measures of technical inefficiencies. Although the extension to the translog profit function is trivial many observations, in practice, may contain negative profits. For this reason we provide a nontrivial extension to the Symmetric Generalized McFadden (SGM) profit function.

Based on cross-sectional and synthetic cohort analysis using the 1973–2000 Current Population Surveys, estimates are obtained for men and women on the returns to schooling and the investment intensity, length, and returns from post-school training. Although the shapes of wage-experience profiles differ substantially across occupations and skill groups, evidence supports the theoretical prediction that rates of return are equivalent across alternative investment paths.

Many countries, however, are unable to address groundwater depletion and pollution owing to weak legal and institutional frameworks. This applies both within national contexts and in respect of international or trans-boundary aquifers (or aquifer systems). The issue is being widely debated within international fora, numbers of countries are revising their water legislation in order to include more specific provisions for groundwater, and in parallel the UN International Law Commission (ILC) is studying trans-boundary groundwater resources with a view to a codification of the law in this regard. However, the key characteristics of groundwater are often misunderstood by non-specialists and, unless resource lawyers and groundwater specialists work much more closely together, there is likelihood of erroneous interpretations of the applicable legal regime.

We estimate a dynamic hierarchical factor model that is able to decompose inflows in a sample of 47 economies into (i) a global factor common to all types of flows and all recipient countries, (ii) a factor specific to a given type of capital inflows, (iii) a regional factor and (iv) a country-specific component. We find that the latter explains by far the largest fraction of fluctuations in capital inflows followed by regional factors, which are particularly important for emerging markets' FDI and portfolio inflows as well as bank lending to Emerging Europe. The global factor, however, explains only a small share of the overall variation. We also employ dynamic panel and time series regressions to explain the determinants of the estimated components.

When measured by the Grubel-Lloyd index of intra-industry trade (SITC3, 4-digit), it is seen that less than 3 per cent of Finnish-Russian trade occurred inside the same industry in 2004. This percentage has even declined slightly during the period studied. In Finlands trade with Germany, the corresponding figure was 31 per cent and in trade with Sweden 47 per cent in 2004. When assessing the development of Finnish imports from Russia, we notice that the dominance of changes in oil prices and of imports of big companies does not allow sensible econometric explanations. In the case of Finnish exports to Russia we find econometric evidence on volumes and values, on aggregate and sectoral, and on annual and quarterly exports. We present several kinds of classifications of FDI, and ask which factors favour exports and which FDI.

"159273920","Gender Equality and Poverty are Intrinsically Linked","This discussion paper provides an updated analysis of gendered economic inequality in high- and middle-income countries. A review of the literature demonstrates that such an analysis needs to explicitly recognize that gender, poverty and (economic) inequality are intrinsically linked. Specifically, the paper addresses two sets of questions: First, how do intrafamily resource allocation and distribution patterns both reflect and shape gender inequalities in power and well-being, and what factors—including policyrelated ones—can mitigate these inequalities? Second, how do families as gendered institutions contribute to broader socio-economic inequalities, and what can be done to reduce/reverse these inequalities? Using data from the LIS Database, this paper shows considerable differences among 42 countries with respect to how likely women were to have their own income. The period from 2000 to 2010/2014 saw increasing rates of own incomes as well as women’s incomes constituting larger shares in total household income. A key finding is that in countries where many women have an income of their own, relative poverty rates are lower. The comparative analyses, combined with a review of the literature, suggest that welfare state arrangements that support working women not only improve the overall employment rates of women but also help to prevent particularly women in low-income households from living in dependence and instead to have an income of their own—thus reinforcing the potential for poverty reduction. Moreover, institutional contexts that are generally conducive to women’s employment tend to be effective across family forms.",2019,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:159273920","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

Others insist that free movement of labour and services makes employment more precarious and causes wage dumping. Less attention has been given to the origins, destinations and nature of flows of posted workers, partly because data on posting are scarce. We aim to fill this gap by exploring unique posting data for Belgium. We argue that while the free movement of labour and a single European labour market have been policy goals for decades, it is the free movement of services that is shaping a hybrid single European labour market, since high levels of short-term service mobility are more significant than long-term labour migration. This is as much a phenomenon of intra-EU15 mobility as of post-accession mobility, and is set to remain more prevalent than classic free movement of labour.",2018,"European Journal of Industrial Relations","10.1177/0959680117708374",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:157650011","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

This is largely due to control over provincial and district level governments by the powerful Ministry of Interior (MoI). In the late 1990s, substantial political and fiscal decentralization reforms were introduced. In particular, the 1999 Decentralization Plan and Procedures Act called for the establishment of a National Decentralization Committee and the formulation of a Decentralization Master Plan. However, with civil society and political parties generally weak, political and policy processes have often been dominated by actors who mistrust decentralization processes. Due to this, the administrative structure overseen by the central MoI has remained in place and become intertwined with the strengthened institutions of political decentralization.

We use the model to examine the importance of a government's tax policy to induce private investments in transportation infrastructure. Our analysis brings to fore insights that are useful in the design of partnership agreements, such as the importance of early and binding government commitments to ensure stable partnerships, and thus, successful projects. Our analysis shows that these strong commitments are even more critical in situations where the success of the partnership requires participation of additional, self-interested parties, such as specialized service providers. Finally, we consider variations of the model where government preferences are explicitly captured, and where the returns from the fixed cost portion of the concessionaire's investment are exempt from taxes. We show that both variations can lead to outcomes where the concessionaire's tax burden is shifted to the service providers. This flexibility can be critical in the design of partnership agreements for (high-risk or highly specialized transportation) projects where additional incentives may be needed to induce private party participation.",2012,"Research in Transportation Economics","10.1016/j.retrec.2012.03.003",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15834386","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

"155532660","Military Spending and Economic Growth in Pakistan","This paper deals with the causal relation between military spending and economic growth of a state. There are three schools of thought on this issue: military spending promotes economic growth; it retards economic growth; and there exists no causal relations between the two. Pakistan’s military spending – being indispensable because of the existing threat perception – has been considered as a burden on the national economy. This paper argues that military spending as part of the budgetary expenditure does not all go in the drain. Its role in the economic development of Pakistan – if less in economic growth – cannot be neglected. However, their indirect impact on the economic growth of Pakistan has been substantial. Technological advancement, provision of security, military’s social uplift projects which positively affect the ‘health’ of the economy, military’s ancillary institutions like Fauji Foundation, Bahria Foundation, Shaheen Foundation, Army Welfare Trust (AWT) are performing their role directly in the economic growth of the state. Importantly, Arms trade internationally has been contributing trillions of dollars in various states economies. This paper suggests that defence industrial capacity and efficiency can be improved in order to increase the output, which in turn, would help the state’s economy by earning millions of dollars through arms sale at the international arena and by ensuring the continued supply of necessary equipment to its armed forces, especially in the times of crises – which in turn, may not only ensure the security of the Pakistan, but also reducing the political leverage being held by great powers on Pakistan. To achieve the target, as a first step, efficient planning be done so as to make the defence industry self-sufficient, and in the long-run to strengthen it to support the overall military spending.

"152317360","The Impact of Bankruptcy Reform on “True Sale” Determination in Securitization Transactions","THE IMPACT OF BANKRUPTCY REFORM ON ""TRUE SALE"" DETERMINATION IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS* I. INTRODUCTION Both Houses of Congress have passed similar bankruptcy reform bills,1 and President Bush has signaled he would sign such a bill (""Reform Act"") once Congress reconciles the differences between the House and Senate versions.2 Among other things, the Reform Act would create, for the first time, a legislative ""safe harbor"" regarding what constitutes a bankruptcy true sale3 in securitization transactions.4 Because both bills include identical forms of this safe harbor provision, it is expected that the Reform Act will include the safe harbor provision unchanged. Because of the attacks against our country on September 11, 2001 and the resulting economic downturn, it is uncertain when, and indeed whether, Congress will enact the Reform Act.5 At the time of this writing, there was some indication that the Reform Act would be placed back on track.6 Even if the Reform Act is not ultimately enacted in full, it is possible that the provisions that are identical in both House and Senate versions - such as the aforesaid securitization safe harbor - may be enacted separately. II. BACKGROUND Securitization is reputed to be by far the most rapidly growing segment of the U.S. credit markets,7 and its use is rapidly expanding worldwide.8 In a typical transaction, a company usually called the ""originator"" transfers rights to payment from incomeproducing assets such as accounts receivable,9 loans, or lease rentals (collectively, ""receivables"" or ""financial assets"") - or frequently undivided interests in such rights - to a special purpose vehicle (""SPV"").10 The SPV, in turn, issues securities to capital market investors and uses the proceeds of the issuance to pay for the receivables. The investors, who are repaid from collections of the receivables, buy the securities based on their assessments of the value of the receivables. Perhaps the most important issue in a securitization is whether the SPV's investors will continue to be repaid in the event of the originator's bankruptcy. If the SPV owns the receivables, its investors will continue to be repaid; if not, their right to be repaid will be suspended and subject to possible impairment. The SPV will own the receivables only if the transfer of those receivables from the originator to the SPV constitutes a sale under applicable bankruptcy law - usually referred to as a ""true sale.""11 This issue, and the concerns that surround it, are illustrated by the recent bankruptcy case of LTV Steel Company, Inc. (""LTV"").12 LTV challenged its pre-bankruptcy securitization facilities, arguing that the transfers to the SPVs were not true sales, and therefore, LTV should be able to use the collections of receivables as ""cash collateral"" by giving adequate protection under bankruptcy law.13 LTV's rationale was that, without such use, it might have to cease its operations, thereby jeopardizing employee jobs and retiree benefits and adversely affecting the local economy.14 The Bankruptcy Court permitted LTV to use these collections pending resolution of the true sale issue.15 However, LTV should have little importance as a legal precedent because, prior to such resolution, the parties reached a settlement that included a summary finding that the transfers were true sales.16 Nonetheless, to some extent, this use has shaken financial market confidence in securitization. III. THE REFORM ACT The Reform Act provides an explicit ""true sale"" safe harbor for most transfers of receivables in securitization transactions. It does this by amending (sec) 541 of the Bankruptcy Code,17 which defines property of the debtor's estate, to exclude from that estate any ""eligible asset"" transferred to an ""eligible entity"" in connection with an ""asset-backed securitization.""18 Because these terms are expansively defined, the exclusion is broad. The term ""eligible asset,"" for example, means any existing or future-arising financial asset, including interests therein and proceeds thereof, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite period of time. …",2002,"Fordham Journal of Corporate & Financial Law",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:152317360","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"55064414","Entry mode and emerging market MNEs: An analysis of Chinese greenfield and acquisition FDI in the United States","A growing theoretical literature on emerging market MNEs argues they use aggressive acquisitions, often to psychically distant, developed host countries, to obtain strategic assets. The use of acquisitions as the dominant entry mode for strategic asset seeking, therefore, stands at heart of current EM MNE theorizing. To date, however, systematic empirical testing of the motivations for different entry modes by EM MNEs is limited.

"154698290","Shooting Blanks: The War on Tax Havens","The United States Treasury conservatively estimates that tax havens cost the United States over $100 billion annually in lost tax revenue. In response to this epidemic, the United States and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development entered into Tax Information Exchange Agreements with states considered to be tax havens. These agreements received widespread recognition as a means of remedying this growing problem. These agreements, however, are largely symbolic and provide very few additional weapons to combat tax evasion enabled by tax havens. As evidence of this, the estimated annual loss of tax revenue due to tax havens has increased since the enactment of these agreements. This Note argues that information exchange agreements are a reactionary policy and will neither truly eliminate nor curb tax evasion through tax haven states. To effectively combat the tax haven problem, policies must be adopted that should focus on domestic solutions and should strengthen existing laws that are far too weak and underutilized.",2009,"Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies","10.2979/gls.2009.16.2.703",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:154698290","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500
"208159921","The Two-Step Australian Immigration Policy and its Impact on Immigrant Employment Outcomes","Three decades ago most immigrants to Australia with work entitlements came as permanent settlers. Today the annual allocation of temporary visas, with work entitlements, outnumbers permanent settler visas by a ratio of three to one. The new environment, with so many temporary visa holders, has led to a two-step immigration policy whereby an increasing proportion of immigrants come first as a temporary immigrant, to work or study, and then seek to move to permanent status. Around one half of permanent visas are allocated on-shore to those who hold temporary visas with work rights. The labour market implications of this new two-step system are substantial. Immigrants from non-English speaking countries (NES), are affected most. In their early years in Australia, they have substantially reduced full-time employment and substantially increased part-time employment, usually while attending an education institution. Three years after arrival one third of NES immigrants are now employed part-time which, rather than unemployment, is becoming their principal pathway to full-time labour market integration. Surprisingly, little has changed for immigrants from English speaking countries (ES).",2015,"Handbook of the Economics of International Migration","10.1016/b978-0-444-53768-3.09977-x",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208159921","Economics",0.25,5566,0.05894812649594374,21356,500

Both theories, despite their rather different approaches to the subject are shown to have a common premise: advanced countries have experienced a fall in the relative demand for unskilled labour and an increase in that of skilled labour. This single explanation for both phenomena has been dubbed the 'transatlantic consensus'. This paper argues that this consensus, together with the associated theories based on trade with the Third World and skill biased technological progress respectively, is analytically as well as empirically unsatisfactory. It puts forward an alternative analysis which emphasises the role of institutions (e.g. unions, minimum wages), macro-economic conditions and social norms.

In contrast, we find that cultural distance has a positive effect on bilateral trade. A potential explanation for this finding is that firms prefer trade to host-country production in culturally distant countries.

"56403495","Tractable Consideration Set Structures for Assortment Optimization and Network Revenue Management","Discrete-choice models are widely used to model consumer purchase behavior in assortment optimization and revenue management. In many applications, each customer segment is associated with a consideration set that represents the set of products that customers in this segment consider for purchase. The firm has to make a decision on what assortment to offer at each point in time without the ability to identify the customer’s segment. A linear program called the Choice-based Deterministic Linear Program (CDLP) has been proposed to determine these offer sets. Unfortunately, its size grows exponentially in the number of products and it is NP-hard to solve when the consideration sets of the segments overlap. The Segment-based Deterministic Concave Program with some additional consistency equalities (SDCP+) is an approximation of CDLP that provides an upper bound on CDLP’s optimal objective value. SDCP+ can be solved in a fraction of the time required to solve CDLP and often achieves the same optimal objective value. This raises the question under what conditions can one guarantee equivalence of CDLP and SDCP+. In this paper, we obtain a structural result to this end, namely that if the segment consideration sets overlap with a certain tree structure or if they are fully nested, CDLP can be equivalently replaced with SDCP+.

We examined voriconazole exposure-response relationships for patients from nine published clinical trials. The relationship between the mean voriconazole plasma concentration (C(avg)) and clinical response and between the free C(avg)/MIC ratio versus the clinical response were explored using logistic regression. The impact of covariates on response was also assessed. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the relationship between the trough concentration/MIC ratio and the probability of response. The covariates individually related to response were as follows: study (P < 0.001), therapy (primary/salvage, P < 0.001), primary diagnosis (P < 0.001), race (P = 0.004), baseline bilirubin (P < 0.001), baseline alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.014), and pathogen (yeast/mold, P < 0.001). The C(avg) for 72% of the patients was 0.5 to 5.0 μg/ml, with the maximum response rate (74%) at 3.0 to 4.0 μg/ml. The C(avg) showed a nonlinear relationship to response (P < 0.003), with a lower probability at the extremes. For patients with C(avg) < 0.5 μg/ml, the response rate was 57%. The lowest response rate (56%) was seen with a C(avg) ≥ 5.0 μg/ml (18% of patients) and was associated with significantly lower mold infection responses compared to yeasts (P < 0.001) but not with voriconazole toxicity. Higher free C(avg)/MIC ratios were associated with a progressively higher probability of response. Monte Carlo simulation suggested that a trough/MIC ratio of 2 to 5 is associated with a near-maximal probability of response. The probability of response is lower at the extremes of C(avg).

Yet, these controversies (and hoaxes) presume that IQ has some relevance to understanding the president’s actual performance as the nation’s leader. This assumption is examined by reviewing the empirical research on the intelligence–performance association in political leadership, with a special focus on U.S. presidents. The review starts by discussing at-a-distance assessment techniques, a method that has yielded reliable and valid measures of IQ, Intellectual Brilliance, and Openness to Experience; three correlated even if separable concepts. The discussion then turns to the reliable and valid measurement of presidential performance—or “greatness”—via successive surveys of hundreds of experts. These two lines of research then converged on the emergence of a six-predictor equation, in which Intellectual Brilliance plays a major role, to the exclusion of both IQ and Openness. The greatest presidents are those who feature wide interests, and who are artistic, inventive, curious, intelligent, sophisticated, complicated, insightful, wise, and idealistic (but who are far from being either dull or commonplace).

Objective: To develop and validate a preoperative risk index for predicting postoperative pneumonia. Design: Prospective cohort study with outcome assessment based on chart review. Setting: 100 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers performing major surgery. Patients: The risk index was developed by using data on 160 805 patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery between 1 September 1997 and 31 August 1999 and was validated by using data on 155 266 patients undergoing surgery between 1 September 1995 and 31 August 1997. Patients with preoperative pneumonia, ventilator dependence, and pneumonia that developed after postoperative respiratory failure were excluded. Measurements: Postoperative pneumonia was defined by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of nosocomial pneumonia. Results: A total of 2466 patients (1.5%) developed pneumonia, and the 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 21%. A postoperative pneumonia risk index was developed that included type of surgery (abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, thoracic, upper abdominal, neck, vascular, and neurosurgery), age, functional status, weight loss, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, general anesthesia, impaired sensorium, cerebral vascular accident, blood urea nitrogen level, transfusion, emergency surgery, long-term steroid use, smoking, and alcohol use. Patients were divided into five risk classes by using risk index scores. Pneumonia rates were 0.2% among those with 0 to 15 risk points, 1.2% for those with 16 to 25 risk points, 4.0% for those with 26 to 40 risk points, 9.4% for those with 41 to 55 risk points, and 15.3% for those with more than 55 risk points.

"7975545","Assessment of QT and JT Intervals in Patients With Left Bundle Branch Block","BACKGROUND ::: Prolongation of the QT interval is considered a risk factor for cardiac adverse events and mortality. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) lengthens the QT interval. The corrected QT interval (QTc) is most likely overestimated because its prolongation is caused by increases in depolarization duration and not in repolarization. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVES ::: In this study, we aimed to apply corrected JT interval (JTc) as an appropriate measure of ventricular repolarization for predicting QTc in a formula. ::: ::: ::: PATIENTS AND METHODS ::: The study population consisted of 101 patients with sinus rhythm (SR) and narrow QRS complexes (< 120 milliseconds). All patients underwent electrophysiology studies or ablation. A diagnostic catheter was positioned in the right ventricular apex (RVA) to induce LBBB at two different cycle lengths (CLs; 600 and 700 mv). The intrinsic QRS complex, QT time, and JT time were measured during SR and subsequent RVA pacing. The JTc was derived simply by subtracting the QRS duration from the QTc. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Stimulation from the RVA increased the QTc from 456.20 ± 38.63 ms to 530.67 ± 47.73 ms at a CL of 600 (P < 0.0001) and to 502.32 ± 47.26 ms at 700 CL (P < 0.0001). JTc showed no significant changes with stimulation from the RVA (102.97 ± 11.35 ms vs. 103.59 ± 10.67 ms, P = 0.24). There was no significant correlation between JTc and QRS complex duration. A significant correlation was seen between QRS and QTc at both CLs. The ROC curve indicated that sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 67% were obtained with JTc duration of 92.6 ms. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Right ventricular pacing increases the QT interval without increasing the JT interval. Our results confirm that JTc, as an index of repolarization, is independent of ventricular depolarization.

Methods: A prospectively collected database of patients was created and information recorded regarding patient demographics, past medical history, preoperative investigations, grade of operating surgeon, type of AVF formed, primary AVF function, cumulative AVF survival and functional patency. Results: One hundred and sixty-two patients were identified as having had vascular access procedures during the 6 month study period and 143 were included in the final analysis. Secondary AVF patency was established in 123 (86%) of these AVFs and 89 (62.2%) were used for dialysis.

The theory predicts that reliance on gist mental representations (as opposed to verbatim) is more effective in reducing health risks and improving decision making. Technical information was translated into decision-relevant gist representations and gist principles (i.e., healthy values). The SKO was hypothesized to facilitate extracting these gist representations and principles by engaging women in dialogue, “understanding” their responses, and replying appropriately to prompt additional engagement. Participants were randomly assigned to either the obesity prevention tutorial (GistFit) or a control tutorial containing different content using the same technology. Participants were administered assessments of knowledge about nutrition and exercise, gist comprehension, gist principles, behavioral intentions and self-reported behavior. An analysis of engagement in tutorial dialogues and responses to multiple-choice questions to check understanding throughout the tutorial revealed significant correlations between these conversations and scores on subsequent knowledge tests and gist comprehension. Knowledge and comprehension measures correlated with healthier behavior and greater intentions to perform healthy behavior. Differences between GistFit and control tutorials were greater for participants who engaged more fully.

Measurements were also performed on three patients with different accommodation disorders: diabetes, Adie's syndrome and third nerve palsy. Normal response latency is 394 ms (+/-46 SD) and independent of are. Normal response duration increases with age from an average 306 ms at 15 years-of-age to an average 954 ms at 55 years-of-age. Normal latency as well as duration appear to have a large interindividual variability. The diabetic patient had a delayed latency but a normal response duration. The patient with Adie's syndrome had a delayed latency and prolonged duration. The patient with third nerve palsy had a normal latency and duration. We conclude that ultrasonographically determine latency and duration give additional information on accommodation function that is more complete and objective than maximum accommodative amplitude alone. The results in our patients suggest that, in selected cases, this information may aid in the diagnosis and management of patient's complaints.",2007,"Documenta Ophthalmologica","10.1007/BF02583270",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44546818","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500
"25318047","Recurrence risk of ictal asystole in epilepsy","OBJECTIVE ::: To determine the recurrence risk of ictal asystole (IA) and its determining factors in people with epilepsy. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We performed a systematic review of published cases with IA in 3 databases and additionally searched our local database for patients with multiple seizures simultaneously recorded with ECG and EEG and at least one IA. IA recurrence risk was estimated by including all seizures without knowledge of the chronological order. Various clinical features were assessed by an individual patient data meta-analysis. A random mixed effect logistic regression model was applied to estimate the average recurrence risk of IA. Plausibility of the calculated IA recurrence risk was checked by analyzing the local dataset with available information in chronological order. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Eighty patients with 182 IA in 537 seizures were included. Recurrence risk of IA amounted to 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] 32%-50%). None of the clinical factors (age, sex, type and duration of epilepsy, hemispheric lateralization, duration of IA per patient) appeared to have a significant effect on the short-term recurrence risk of IA. When considering the local dataset only, IA recurrence risk was estimated to 30% (95% CI 14%-53%). Information whether IA coincided with symptoms (i.e., syncope) or not was given in 60 patients: 100 out of 142 IAs were symptomatic. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our data suggest that in case of clinically suspected IA, the recording of 1 or 2 seizures is not sufficient to rule out IA. Furthermore, the high short-term recurrence risk favors aggressive treatment, including pacemaker implantation if seizure freedom cannot be achieved.",2017,"Neurology","10.1212/WNL.0000000000004266",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25318047","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500

Moreover, a subset of Crohn's disease (CD) patients with the risk TL1A haplotype is associated with elevated TL1A expression and a more severe disease course. To investigate the in vivo role of elevated TL1A expression, we generated two transgenic (Tg) murine models with constitutive Tl1a expression in either lymphoid or myeloid cells. Compared to wildtype (WT) mice, constitutive expression of Tl1a in either lymphoid or myeloid cells showed mild patchy inflammation in the small intestine, which was more prominent in the ileum. In addition, mice with constitutive Tl1a expression exhibited enhanced intestinal and colonic fibrosis compared to WT littermates. The percentage of T cells expressing the gut homing chemokine receptors CCR9 and CCR10 was higher in the Tl1a Tg mice compared to WT littermates. Sustained expression of Tl1A in T cells also lead to increased Foxp3+ Treg cells. T cells or antigen presenting cells (APC) with constitutive expression of Tl1a were found to have a more activated phenotype and mucosal mononuclear cells exhibit enhanced Th1 cytokine activity.

Factors contributing to the incidence of EDTA-PTCP are unknown, and no study has assessed the prognosis of EDTA-PTCP patients.This retrospective study assessed characteristics in EDTA-PTCP patients and matched controls to determine differences in prognosis.A retrospective case–control study was designed. From the University of Tokyo Hospital database, we identified patients diagnosed with EDTA-PTCP between 2009 and 2012, and performed 1:2 case:control matching for age and sex. A control group of sex- and age-matched patients was selected at random from the same database. We investigated differences in the frequency of complications, medication history, and blood transfusion history between the groups at the time of blood collection. Prognosis was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, autoimmune disease, liver disease, and malignant tumor.We identified 104 EDTA-PTCP patients and 208 matched controls. The median age was 69.0 years (interquartile range: 54–76), with men comprising 51%.

"18125285","Sinomenine inhibits activation of rat retinal microglia induced by advanced glycation end products.","Abstract Diabetic retinopathy involves an inflammatory response in the retina characterized by an increase in inflammatory cytokines and activation of microglia. The degree of microglia activation may influence the extent of retina injury following an inflammatory stimulus. Cytokines, released by activated microglia, regulate the influx of inflammatory cells to the damaged area. Thus, therapeutic strategy to reduce cytokine expression in microglia would be neuroprotective. Sinomenine, an alkaloid isolated from the stem and root of Sinomenium acutum , has long been recognized as an anti-inflammatory drug for rheumatoid arthritis and also inhibits macrophage activation. In this study, we activated retinal microglia in culture with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) treatment and attempted to determine whether sinomenine could reduce the production of cytokines from the activated microglia at both gene and protein levels. Changes in inflammatory cytokines, TNF alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6, were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) both in the presence and absence of AGEs. The effect of sinomenine on levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 were studied with a laser confocal scanning microscope. AGEs treatment induced a significant release of TNF alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 from retinal microglia. Sinomenine could inhibit release of these cytokines. Sinomenine attenuated ROS production in a dose-dependent fashion and reduced the nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 in AGEs-activated retinal microglia in culture.",2007,"International immunopharmacology","10.1016/j.intimp.2007.07.030",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18125285","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500

"8714104","Insights into structural and functional diversity of Dof (DNA binding with one finger) transcription factor","MAIN CONCLUSION ::: The structural, functional and in-silico studies of Dof transcription factor attempted so far reveals immense opportunity to analyze the plant genomes in terms of number of Dof genes and discuss in light of the evolution. The multiple functions of Dof genes needs to explored for crop improvement. Transcription factors play a very vital role in gene regulation at transcriptional level and are being extensively studied across phylas. In recent years, sequencing of plant genomes has led to genome-wide identification and characterizations of diverse types of plant-specific transcription factor gene family providing key insights into their structural and functional diversity. The DNA binding with one finger (Dof), a class belonging to C2H2-type zinc finger family proteins, is a plant-specific transcription factor having multiple roles such as seed maturation and germination, phytohormone and light-mediated regulation and plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Dof proteins are present across plant lineage, from green algae to higher angiosperm, and represent a unique class of transcription factor having bifunctional binding activities, with both DNA and proteins, to regulate the complex transcriptional machinery in plant cells. The structural and functional diversity of the Dof transcription factor family along with the bioinformatics analysis highlighting the phylogeny of Dof families is reviewed in light of its importance in plant biotechnology for crop improvement.",2014,"Planta","10.1007/s00425-014-2239-3",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8714104","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500
"25889379","Optimal compressive force accelerates osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells","Mechanical stress produced by orthodontic forces is a factor in the remodeling of periodontal ligaments (PDLs) and alveolar bone. It has been reported that the expression of a number of cytokines associated with osteoclastogenesis is upregulated when compressive forces act on osteoblasts and PDL cells. The present study investigated the effects of compressive forces on the formation of osteoclasts from the macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Compressive forces on osteoclasts were exerted using layers of 3, 5, 7, 9 or 14 glass cover slips on the 4th day of culture for 24 h. The number of osteoclasts was determined by counting the number of cells positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Osteoclastogenesis advanced rapidly on days four and five. The number of osteoclasts with >8 nuclei peaked when the force of 7 slips was applied, which was therefore regarded as the optimal compressive force. Alterations in the expression of osteoclast-associated genes are associated with changes in the differentiation and fusion of macrophages in response to compressive forces; therefore, osteoclast-associated genes were assessed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction in the present study. The mRNA expression of osteoclast‑associated genes increased significantly after 3 h of optimal compression, whereas mRNA expression increased after 24 h in the control group. These findings suggested that osteoclastogenesis of macrophages was accelerated when an optimal compressive force was applied.",2015,"Molecular medicine reports","10.3892/mmr.2015.4141",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25889379","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500

"12419958","The oculogyral illusion: retinal and oculomotor factors","Subjects in a dark chamber exposed to angular acceleration while viewing a head-fixed target experience motion and displacement of the target relative to their body. Competing explanations of this phenomenon, known as the oculogyral illusion, have attributed it to the suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) or to retinal slip. In the dark, the VOR evokes compensatory eye movements in the direction opposite to body acceleration. A head-fixed visual target will tend to suppress these eye movements. The VOR suppression hypothesis attributes the oculogyral illusion to the signals that prevent reflexive deviation of the eyes from the target thus resulting in apparent target displacement in the direction of acceleration. The retinal slip hypothesis attributes the illusion to inadequate fixation of the target with the eyes being involuntarily deviated in the direction opposite acceleration, the retinal slip being interpreted as target displacement in the direction of acceleration. Another possibility is that the illusion could arise from a change in the representation of the perceived head midline. To evaluate these three alternative hypotheses, we tested 8 subjects at 4 acceleration rates (2, 10, 20, 30°/s²) in each of three conditions: (a) fixate and point to a target light; (b) fixate to the target light and point to the head midline; (c) look straight ahead in the dark. The displacement magnitude of the oculogyral illusion was least at 2°/s² ≈ 2° and was ≈10° at the other acceleration rates. The presence of the target light significantly attenuated eye movements relative to the dark condition, but eye movements were still present at the 10, 20, and 30°/s² accelerations. The eye velocity profiles in the dark at different acceleration rates did not show a one-to-one inverse mapping to the magnitude of the oculogyral illusion at those rates. The perceived head midline was not significantly displaced at any of the acceleration rates. The oculogyral illusion thus has at least two contributing factors: the suppression of nystagmus at low acceleration rates and at higher acceleration rates, a partial suppression coupled with an integration of the drift of the eyes with respect to the fixation target.",2011,"Experimental Brain Research","10.1007/s00221-011-2567-5",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12419958","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500

Such methods might be based on alteration of brain response caused by morphine during painful stimuli. The study included 11 healthy volunteers subjectively quantifying perception of painful electrical stimulations in the esophagus. Brain evoked potentials following stimulations were recorded from sixty-four electroencephalographic channels at baseline and ninety minutes after morphine administration. Marginals obtained from discrete wavelet coefficients for each channel were used as input to an optimized support vector machine classifying between baseline and after morphine administration. The electroencephalographic channel leading to the best performance was further analyzed to identify brain alterations caused by morphine. Marginals from volunteers with no analgesic effect were examined for differences in comparison to volunteers with effect. The single-channel classification showed best performance at electrode P4 with 84.1 % of the traces classified correctly. When combining features from the 6 best performing channels, the multichannel classification increased to 92.4 %. The most discriminative feature was a decrease in the delta band (0.5 – 4 Hz) after morphine for volunteers with analgesic effect. Volunteers with no effect of morphine showed an increase in the delta band after drug administration.

"35276437","Diagnostic value of high resolution computed tomography in the assessment of nodular changes in pneumoconiosis in foundry workers in Lublin","The workers of an iron foundry were exposed to air pollution, which after some time of exposure results in lung fibrosis among some workers. The diagnosis of pneumoconiosis in workers of an iron foundry is based mainly on the radiological findings among workers exposed to the dust causing lung fibrosis. However, on radiograms many parenchymal structures overlap, which limits sensitivity and specificity to the method. Difficulties in accurate interpretation of conventional radiograms in silicosis also result from their relatively low resolution. The purpose of the present study was to assess the value and usefulness of high resolution computed tomography in the diagnostics of nodular changes in foundry workers' pneumoconiosis, compared to conventional radiography. The study group consisted of 64 iron foundry workers in whom silicosis had been recognized. The average age of the group was 51 years and the mean silica exposure time was 23 years. Chest radiograms with hard X- rays were taken at the maximal inspiration phase. For the HRCT examination the Siemens Somatom ART apparatus was used, equipped with a 512 ◊ 512 pixels reconstruction matrix and a special programme for high resolution algorithm image reconstruction. In our material, consistency of results for conventional radiography and HRCT in revealing the presence of nodules was high. A statistically significant increase in detectability of intralobular nodules and peripheral nodules localized under the pleura was observed. The increase in detectability of cavernous, calcified nodules and those in the upper pulmonary fields obtained from computed tomography, however, was not statistically significant.

"18878393","Aedes aegypti D7 Saliva Protein Inhibits Dengue Virus Infection","Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of several medically relevant arboviruses including dengue virus (DENV) types 1-4. Ae. aegypti transmits DENV by inoculating virus-infected saliva into host skin during probing and feeding. Ae. aegypti saliva contains over one hundred unique proteins and these proteins have diverse functions, including facilitating blood feeding. Previously, we showed that Ae. aegypti salivary gland extracts (SGEs) enhanced dissemination of DENV to draining lymph nodes. In contrast, HPLC-fractionation revealed that some SGE components inhibited infection. Here, we show that D7 proteins are enriched in HPLC fractions that are inhibitory to DENV infection, and that recombinant D7 protein can inhibit DENV infection in vitro and in vivo. Further, binding assays indicate that D7 protein can directly interact with DENV virions and recombinant DENV envelope protein. These data reveal a novel role for D7 proteins, which inhibits arbovirus transmission to vertebrates through a direct interaction with virions.",2016,"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases","10.1371/journal.pntd.0004941",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18878393","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500
"22602830","Cell adhesion molecules in the normal and cancerous mammary gland","Loss of normal tissue morphology is one of the first changes seen in the development of solid malignant tumours, including breast cancers. Since cell adhesion molecules play a crucial role in maintaining normal tissue architecture, investigations into the molecular mechanisms involved in the morphological changes occurring in malignancy that focus on the expression and function of cell adhesion molecules in malignant progression are extremely relevant. This review discusses the cadherin and integrin families of adhesion molecules which have been shown to be extremely important in the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions of epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical studies using tissue and tumour sections indicate that a reduction in levels of expression or function of both types of cell adhesion molecules is indeed observed in many breast cancers. A specific and crucial role for these molecules in the maintenance of normal morphological differentiation has been demonstratedin vitro, where the noninvasive differentiated phenotype correlates with the normal functioning of E-Cadherin and α2β1 integrin. Furtherin vitro evidence suggests that in mammary epithelial cells, oncogenes may be upstream regulators of both the expression and function of E-Cadherin, the α2β1 integrin, and other epithelial specific molecules important for maintaining epithelial differentiation.

"43341235","Spin current in an electron waveguide tunnel-coupled to topological insulator","We show that electron tunneling from edge states in two-dimensional topological insulator into a parallel electron waveguide leads to the appearance of spin-polarized current in the waveguide. The spin polarization $P$ can be very close to unity and the electron current passing through the tunnel contact splits in the waveguide into two branches flowing from the contact. The polarization essentially depends on the electron scattering by the contact and the electron-electron interaction in the one-dimensional edge states. The electron-electron interaction is treated within the Luttinger liquid model. The main effect of the interaction stems from the renormalization of the electron velocity, due to which the polarization increases with the interaction strength. Electron scattering by the contact leads to a decrease in $P$. A specific effect occurs when the bottom of the subbands in the waveguide crosses the Dirac point of the spectrum of edge states when changing the voltage or chemical potential.

"18953823","L-Arginine counteracts nitric oxide deficiency and improves the recovery phase of ischemic acute renal failure in rats","BACKGROUND ::: In ischemic acute renal failure (ARF), nitric oxide-dependent regulation of renal hemodynamics and glomerular function is disturbed. Previous studies indicate that the nitric oxide precursor l-arginine (l-Arg) has beneficial effects on renal function. Here we further analyzed the impact of l-Arg on functional and biochemical parameters of nitric oxide signaling during the course of ischemic ARF. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Ischemic ARF was induced in rats by bilateral clamping of renal arteries for 45 minutes. l-Arg was applied intraperitoneally during clamping, and orally during 14 days of follow-up. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured, and biochemical parameters analyzed by protein immunoblots. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Clamping resulted in 70% to 90% reduction of GFR and RPF, with a gradual recovery by day 14. Using an in situ assay with the oxidative fluorescent dye hydroethidine, increased tubular generation of O2- was detected in the early course of ischemic ARF, indicating enhanced oxidative stress. These findings were accompanied by up-regulation of the nitric oxide receptor, soluble guanylate cyclase, and by significant regulatory changes of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS expression. l-Arg had a beneficial effect on GFR and RPF, decreased O2- production, diminished up-regulation of soluble guanylate cyclase, and prevented up-regulation of iNOS. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Ischemic ARF is accompanied by marked alterations in the expression of key enzymes of the nitric oxide pathway, indicative for deficiency of constitutive NOS activity. l-Arg supplementation reduces O2- generation and significantly improves the expression of nitric oxide signaling proteins as well as the recovery phase of ischemic ARF.",2003,"Kidney international","10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00063.x",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18953823","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500

To characterize the anxiety model pharmacologically, cockerels were administered drug probes that were either: (1) only effective for treating panic disorder (phenelzine 3.125–25.0 mg/kg), (2) effective for treating both panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (alprazolam 0.065–0.5 mg/kg; clonidine 0.1–0.25 mg/kg; imipramine 1.0–15.0 mg/kg), (3) only effective for treating generalized anxiety disorder (buspirone 2.5–10.0 mg/kg; trazodone 0.1–3.0 mg/kg) or (4) capable of exacerbating symptoms of panic disorder in humans (yohimbine 0.1–3.0 mg/kg). At 7 days after hatch, chicks received either vehicle or drug probe intramuscularly 15 min prior to social separation under a mirror (low-stress) or no-mirror (high-stress) condition for a 180-s observation period. Dependent measures were distress vocalizations to index separation stress and sleep-onset latency to index sedation. Phenelzine, alprazolam, imipramine and clonidine were able to attenuate distress vocalizations (at doses without significant sedation) whereas buspirone and trazodone did not. Paradoxically, yohimbine modestly attenuated distress vocalizations.

Recent studies from high income countries have demonstrated associations between maternal smoking during pregnancy and children’s excess body weight. We examine associations between maternal smoking during pregnancy and children’s overweight or obesity, in six countries in the less affluent Central/Eastern European region. Questionnaire data were analysed, for 8,926 singleton children aged 9–12 years. Country-specific odds ratios for effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on being overweight, and on obesity, were estimated using logistic regression. Heterogeneity between country-specific results, and mean effects (allowing for heterogeneity) were estimated. Positive associations between maternal smoking and overweight were seen in all countries but Romania. While not individually statistically significant, the mean odds ratio was 1.26 (95% CI 1.03–1.55), with no evidence of between-country heterogeneity. Obese children were few (2.7%), and associations between obesity and maternal smoking during pregnancy were more heterogeneous, with odds ratios ranging from 0.71 (0.32–1.57) in Poland to 5.49 (2.11–14.30) in Slovakia. Between-country heterogeneity was strongly related to average persons-per-room, a possible socioeconomic indicator, with stronger associations where households were less crowded. Estimates of dose–response relationships tended to be small and non-significant, even when pooled.

The side effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are mostly gastrointestinal and dermatological, and are usually resolved after symptomatic treatment. However, new complications have now arisen due to increased use of these drugs. Here we report a side effect of erlotinib that has not been described previously: that is, metastatic lung tumor nodules were transformed into cysts, which ruptured the pleura and were responsible for bilateral life-threatening pneumothorax. We report the case of a 35-year-old Caucasian woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma and a deletion in epidermal growth factor receptor exon 19 (del E746-A750). She was treated with erlotinib for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Treatment with erlotinib resulted in the replacement of pulmonary tumor nodules with air-containing cysts. These cysts ruptured in the pleura causing a life-threatening bilateral pneumothorax. To the best of our knowledge, this tumor–cystic response after erlotinib therapy has not been previously described.

It also may predict which ACS patients will benefit from glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa blockade. ::: ::: ::: METHODS AND RESULTS ::: We prospectively studied 1160 patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS randomized in PARAGON-B to receive lamifiban, an intravenous GP IIb/IIIa antagonist, or placebo. TnT levels were obtained before study treatment began and 24 to 72 hours later; assays were performed by a blinded core laboratory. At baseline, 40.2% of patients were TnT-positive (>/=0.1 ng/mL); these patients were older and more often male or smokers. Patients positive at baseline had a significantly higher rate of the primary end point (composite of death, myocardial [re]infarction, or severe recurrent ischemia at 30 days; odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1) than those who were TnT-negative. Lamifiban was associated with significant reduction in the primary end point (from 19.4% to 11.0%, P=0.01) among TnT-positive patients but not among TnT-negative patients (11.2% for placebo versus 10.8% for lamifiban, P=0.86; P=0.08 for test of interaction between TnT status and treatment assignment). This pattern held for the end points of death alone and death or myocardial (re)infarction at 30 days.

CD4(+) T-cells are critical for initiating and maintaining adaptive immunity elicited by infection or vaccination. It was reported previously that HAdV-35 can bind these cells and suppress their activation. The data reported here demonstrate that recombinant trimeric HAdV-35 knob proteins alone can induce CD46 receptor downregulation and inhibit interleukin-2 production and proliferation of human CD4(+) T-cells in vitro similarly to mAbs specific to the CD46 region bound by HAdV-35 knobs. A mutant knob protein with increased affinity for CD46 compared with the wild-type knob caused equivalent effects. In contrast, a CD46-binding-deficient mutant knob protein did not inhibit T-cell activation. Thus, the capacity of HAdV-35 to attenuate human CD4(+) T-cell activation depends predominantly on knob interactions with CD46 and can occur independently of infection.",2012,"The Journal of general virology","10.1099/vir.0.039222-0",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26196412","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500

In this study, a facile strategy was reported to simultaneously realize an improved photocorrosion resistance and rapid interfacial H2-evolution reaction of CdxZn1-xS solid-solution photocatalysts in a sulfur-rich S2-/SO32- solution. Here, the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystal photocatalysts are prepared by a one-step co-precipitation route through the direct introduction of Zn2+/Cd2+ mixing ions in a sulfur-rich Na2S-Na2SO3 solution, and the resultant CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals (ca. 5 nm) display a suspensible structure owing to the numerous and selective adsorption of S2-/SO32- on the surface of these CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals. It is found that the bandgap structure of CdxZn1-xS (from 2.25 to 3.52 eV) nanocrystals can be easily controlled by adjusting the Cd2+/Zn2+ molar ratio. The photocatalytic experimental results suggested that the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystal photocatalysts clearly displayed an excellent photocatalytic H2-production performance, and the suspensible Cd0.6Zn0.4S nanocrystals exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2-generation performance of 717.19 μmol h-1, a value higher than that of the sole CdS (320.99 μmol h-1) and ZnS (5.89 μmol h-1) by a factor of 2.2 and 121.8 times, respectively. Based on the experimental results, a possible S2- active site-mediated mechanism accounted for the high H2-production activity of the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals, namely the numerous adsorbed S2- ions not only function as efficient hole scavengers to rapidly consume the photogenerated holes, resulting in an improved photocorrosion resistance of suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals, but also serve as effective H+-capturing active sites to accelerate the interfacial H2-production reaction.

The expression patterns were evaluated and quantified for each hematopoietic lineage and each leukemia subtype. In normal BMB, immature granulopoiesis showed weak ID2 and strong ID3 expression, which was lost during maturation (p < 0.001). Erythropoiesis remained negative for ID2/3 (p < 0.001). ID2/3 expression differed between immature granulopoiesis and leukemic blasts (p < 0.001).

"18054463","CpG methylation regulates allelic expression of GDF5 by modulating binding of SP1 and SP3 repressor proteins to the osteoarthritis susceptibility SNP rs143383","GDF5 encodes an extracellular signalling molecule that is essential for normal skeletal development. The rs144383 C to T SNP located in the 5ʹUTR of this gene is functional and has a pleiotropic effect on the musculoskeletal system, being a risk factor for knee-osteoarthritis (OA), congenital hip dysplasia, lumbar disc degeneration and Achilles tendon pathology. rs143383 exerts a joint-wide effect on GDF5 expression, with expression of the OA-associated T allele being significantly reduced relative to the C allele, termed allelic expression imbalance. We have previously reported that the GDF5 locus is subject to DNA methylation and that allelic imbalance of rs143383 is mediated by SP1, SP3 and DEAF1 transcriptional repressors. In this study, we have assayed GDF5 methylation in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage, and investigated the effect of methylation on the allelic imbalance of rs143383. We observed demethylation of the GDF5 5ʹUTR in OA knee cartilage relative to both OA (p = 0.009) and non-OA (p = 0.001) hip cartilage, with the most significant demethylation observed at the highly conserved +37 CpG site located 4 bp upstream of rs143383. Methylation modulates the level and direction of allelic imbalance of rs143383, with methylation of the +37 CpG dinucleotide within the SP1/SP3 binding site having an allele-specific effect on SP1 and SP3 binding. Furthermore, methylation attenuated the repressive effects of SP1, SP3 and DEAF1 on GDF5 promoter activity. This data suggest that the differential methylation of the +37 CpG site between osteoarthritic hip and knee cartilage may be responsible for the knee-specific effect of rs143383 on OA susceptibility.",2014,"Human Genetics","10.1007/s00439-014-1447-z",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18054463","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500
"1498452","Effects of Team-Based Learning on short-term and long-term retention of factual knowledge","PURPOSE ::: We investigated the effect of Team-Based Learning (TBL) on long-term retention of knowledge in comparison to a traditional curriculum. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: As TBL was incorporated into our curriculum in the 2008-2009 academic year, students were compared with those who received the traditional curriculum the year prior. Students in both the groups completed multiple-choice knowledge test at four time points spanning two years. Test performance was compared at each time point to assess changes in knowledge retention as a function of time. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Baseline knowledge did not differ significantly between the TBL and control groups [51% versus 46%; t(84) = 0.91, p = 0.37, d = 0.20]. Performance improved after the course for both the groups, but was significantly higher in the TBL group [79% versus 59%; t(84) = 4.96, p = 0.000004, d = 0.95]. However, when assessed prior to the pediatrics clerkship, learning gains from TBL had largely disappeared and the small difference in performance was not significant [57% versus 51%; t(84) = 1.51, p = 0.14, d = 0.32]. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Incorporating TBL into the pre-clinical pediatrics curriculum led to large gains in knowledge over the short-term, but these gains did not persist. Further research should focus on extending the impact of TBL on long-term knowledge retention.",2016,"Medical teacher","10.3109/0142159X.2015.1034663",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1498452","Medicine",0.15,76667,0.8119611954841033,21356,500

Upon co-culture of a single embryo with trophoblastic vesicles in vitamin-supplemented medium 199, embryo development to the blastocyst stage was significantly higher than in embryos co-cultured with trophoblastic vesicles in RPMI 1640 or with cumulus cells in medium 199 (control). In the absence of the vitamin cocktail, co-culture with trophoblastic vesicles in medium 199 did not improve embryo development compared with that of the control. The vitamin cocktail was effective in embryo development when co-cultured with trophoblastic vesicles, but not with cumulus cells. Embryo development was not improved in the absence of co-cultured trophoblastic vesicles, even in the presence of vitamin cocktail.

In an attempt to ward off these electoral newcomers, established parties have pursued strategies of disengagement, such as exclusion and de-legitimisation. This study examines the electoral effects of an excessive form of de-legitimisation, which we label ‘demonisation’. We estimate the effects of demonisation on electoral support for the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) and its predecessor Groep Wilders.

"170008370","Insights on fostering the emergence of robust conservation actions from Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE program","One strategy to address threats to biodiversity in the face of ongoing budget constraints is to create an enabling environment that facilitates individuals, communities and other groups to self-organise to achieve conservation outcomes. Emergence (new activities and initiatives), and robustness (durability of these activities and initiatives over time), two related concepts from the common pool resources literature, provide guidance on how to support and enable such self-organised action for conservation. To date emergence has received little attention in the literature. Our exploratory synthesis of the conditions for emergence from the literature highlighted four themes: for conservation to emerge, actors need to 1) recognise the need for change, 2) expect positive outcomes, 3) be able to experiment to achieve collective learning, and 4) have legitimate local scale governance authority. Insights from the literature on emergence and robustness suggest that an appropriate balance should be maintained between external guidance of conservation and enabling local actors to find solutions appropriate to their contexts. We illustrate the conditions for emergence, and its interaction with robustness, through discussing the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) in Zimbabwe and reflect on efforts at strengthening local autonomy and management around the world. We suggest that the delicate balance between external guidance of actions, and supporting local actors to develop their own solutions, should be managed adaptively over time to support the emergence of robust conservation actions.",2019,"Global Ecology and Conservation","10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00538",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:170008370","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

"54754603","rs’ and Breeders’ Rights: Bridging Access to, and IP Protection of, Plant Varieties in Africa","Studies in Africa have shown that saving, using, exchanging and selling farm-saved seed is the main channel through which farmers access seed and planting material. Moreover, these saving and related practices are recognised in international law, mainly through the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (Plant Treaty), which many African countries have ratified. These practices are also recognised by, inter alia, obligations at the national level to protect traditional knowledge relevant to seeds and planting material. The standard being employed in developing plant variety protection (PVP) mechanisms in Africa, as with elsewhere in the world, is the 1991 revision of the Convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV, 1991). This Convention has, since its inception, been developed with reference to developed-world farming practices. This article looks at how farmers’ rights are enshrined in Africa’s legal frameworks, and the extent to which the current process of developing regional PVP systems on the continent is taking farmers’ rights into account.

"17493723","The quest for gender equality and womens empowerment in least developed countries: Policy and strategy implications for achieving millennium development goals in Ethiopia","This paper critically reviewed the gender equality and women’s empowerment endeavors in least developed countries (LDCs) and proposed policy and strategy measures for achieving millennium development goals (MDGs) in Ethiopia. Ethiopian women are economically, socially, culturally and politically disadvantaged in the enjoyment of equal rights, in accessing opportunities, decision-making processes, and basic resources. In other words, although a number of policies are emerging that support and encourage women’s participation in development, women’s access to and control of productive resources, information, training and education, employment and in decision-making are limited. The general objective of this paper is to assess the quest for gender equality and women’s empowerment in least developed countries to achieve MDGs and identify policy and strategy implications for Ethiopia. This paper adapts a human ecological approach and a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing literature was made in order to obtain both theoretical insights and secondary data on the review themes. The collected secondary data and information were qualitatively analyzed through narration and description and presented under relevant themes. The findings of the study reveal that promising efforts are being made by the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to address gender equality and women’s empowerment issues in the process of achieving millennium development goals. Nevertheless, a lot has to be done for more effective gender equality and women’s empowerment thereby the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development objectives will be achieved in Ethiopia. Adaptation of the good practices of gender equality and women’s empowerment from different successful countries, proper implementation of the ratified international conventions on gender equality and women’s empowerment, and development and implementation of appropriate national gender policy will improve the condition of Ethiopian women in the years to come. ::: ::: ::: ::: Key words: Development, empowerment, equality, ethiopia, gender, women.",2013,"International journal of sociology and anthropology","10.5897/IJSA2013.0454",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17493723","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500
"150542390","A Unified Ethical Frame for Big Data Analysis","Big data provides unprecedented opportunities to drive information-based innovation in economies, healthcare, public safety, education, transportation and almost every human endeavour. Big data also creates risk to both individuals and society unless effective governance is in place. That governance must be sensitive to reticence, the harm to individuals when data is not used because of ambiguity on how to apply laws, standards and regulations, as well as to privacy. Governance must be holistic taking into consideration concepts of good and bad from all potential stakeholders. That means that the analysis should consider the benefits and risks to the individual, for society as a whole, and for the parties conducting big data discovery and application. Moreover, data protection requires a full understanding of the potential impact of big data on the full range of human rights, not just those related to privacy. To establish big data governance, the Foundation believes in the need for a common ethical frame based on key values and the need for an interrogation framework. The latter consists of a set of key questions to be asked and answered to illuminate significant issues, both for industry and for those providing oversight to assess big data projects. Reviews must be from the 360-degree ethical perspective discussed above. That assessment must take into consideration all human, as well as societal and business interests and rights. In formulating a frame, we concluded the following: governance requires enforcement, big data enforcement needs to be explored by stakeholders and interrogation frameworks should be customized (at least at the industry level and possibly down to the company level). To assure project materials are approachable, they will be broken into four parts:• Part A – Unified ethical frame;• Part B – Interrogation framework;• Part C – Enforcement discussion;• Part D – Industry interrogation models.Parts A and B will be completed in the project’s first phase. Part C will focus on enforcement, and Part D will create examples. It is anticipated that Parts A and B will be completed in 2014 and will be shared prior to starting the later parts.This is a living document.

"59025646","Rape and Sexual Violence: Questionable Inevitability and Moral Responsibility in Armed Conflict","Wartime sexual violence is a critical human rights issue that usurps the autonomy of its victims as well as their physical and psychological safety. It occurs in both ethnic and non-ethnic wars, across geographic regions, against both men and women, and regardless of the “official” position of commanders, states, and armed groups on the use of rape as tactic of war. This problem is current, pervasive, and global in spite of the status of wartime sexual violence perpetration as a crime against humanity and the capacity of the international criminal court to indict offenders. Though some scholars have argued that wartime rape is inevitable given a global patriarchal culture and the violent context of war, this argument upholds a problematic view of opportunistic sexual violence as an inevitable, anticipated side-effect of violent conflict. In order to counteract such harmful claims, this research examines two cases in which armed militant groups engaged in civil wars have limited the use of rape as a tactic of war. The examination of the cases of Sri Lanka and El Salvador may challenge the narrative of wartime rape inevitability and reinforce a framework through which perpetrators may be held accountable for sexual and gender-based war crimes.

This is a study of the EU legislation on irregular migration, as well as an attempt to classify it and analyze the future of EU migration legislation with the increase of irregular migration into the EU. The author systematizes and classifies the current EU legislation on irregular migration, and analyzes the conditions in which this legislation was developed. Using the legislation analysis method, the author proposes the following classification of EU legislation on irregular migration: rules preventing assistance to irregular migration, rules preventing employment of irregular migrants, rules on the return of irregular migrants and readmission, rules on border control, and rules on collaboration with third countries. The author pays special attention to the current state of irregular migration to the EU, dubbed the ‘greatest migration crisis in Europe’, and concludes that the European Union succeeded in the development of pioneering legislation on irregular migration, which may serve as the basis for reception by other states. However, changes in the political and economic situation in the south of the Union have made the current legal mechanisms incapable of withstanding new threats.

As she began to read the local newspaper, a woman sitting nearby on the car interrupted her, asking if there was any news of the war. Anne Lane replied that there was not, but the woman continued to ply her with questions. Was Richmond not taken? Did she think General Price, commander of the Missouri Confederate forces, was in nearby Jefferson County? If not, did she think he was coming? To each question, Anne Lane indicated that she knew nothing, or that the persistent and rather invasive stranger certainly knew as much as she did. Finally, as she wrote to her sister, Sarah Lane Glasgow, “ ... thinking the catechism had gone far enough, I began to talk to Baby and turned a deaf ear to my inquisitive friend.” Anne Lane was no fool, after all, she wasn’t simply being rude, she was sure that she knew a spy when she saw one.

The 2 KPIs are; (1) number of graduates who are already employed and (2) being self-employed since leaving the university until their convocation ceremony. At the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, UiTM, the Student Affairs Department has taken several initiatives to overcome the issue. Programmes were introduced to strategically cater the 4 problems. For the English proficiency problem, English entry test was introduced and students who attained below satisfactory level were required to attend a Fundamental English Programme organized by the faculty. At the end of the English programme, the students were required to sit for exit test. The effectiveness of the programme and the improvement of the students were recorded.

"197793375","Paradox of Social Capital in the Implementation of Public Policy (Finding in the Tanimbar Islands Regency)","The era of decentralization (autonomization) has begun in Indonesia since 1999. Various public policies have been made to support the implementation of decentralization. Of the many public policies, there are those that have been successfully implemented, but not a few have experienced ineffectiveness to failure. Many studies reveal that social capital is one of the factors that supports the successful implementation of various public policies. However, there is still very little research that looks at the dark side (paradox) of social capital, which contributes to the ineffectiveness of the implementation of a public policy. This paper discusses the paradox of social capital that causes the ineffectiveness of the process of implementing a public policy. The various cases discussed in this paper show that local government as implementing institution face serious obstacles in implementing various public policies, when public policies collide with the values of social capital that are lived and trusted by the local community. The Tanimbar Islands are a small and poor regency in Maluku Province, which also experiences this problematic situation. This situation occurs when the applied public policies clash with reality regarding some forms (manifestations) of social capital found in the community, such as the cultural values of duan lolat, sweri practices, and communal lifestyles in tnyafar. By showing the case of the Tanimbar Islands, we can see the dark side of social capital in the implementation of public policies, which in the future, need to be resolved.",2019,"Policy & Governance Review","10.30589/pgr.v3i2.132",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197793375","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

CMCD seeks to provide a stable and orderly learning environment in which students become self-disciplined and empowered, by experiencing greater responsibility. The number of schools that have adopted CMCD in the United States and England surpassed 211 schools (involving 120,000 students) in 2001. CMCD’s effectiveness assessment involved two vertical (K-12) clusters of schools, one in Houston and the other in Newark. Houston’s assessment was a descriptive one-group study, while Newark’s was a two-group quasiexperimental study involving a matched-pair of 228 CMCD and 228 Non-CMCD comparison students. The assessment findings indicated that, prior to CMCD’s implementation in 1995-96, four of the nine participating Houston schools had Teacher-Student Relationships’ mean scores above the national mean of 50, while the remaining five had scores below the national mean, but by the third year, all of the schools had achieved considerable gains, with eight schools achieving mean scores of 61% – 73%, considerably above the national average. Five of the eight schools achieved gains that were statistically significant. By the fourth year of CMCD’s implementation, all of the participating schools had also experienced a significant decline in the number of students referred to the offices of their principals, with a combined decrease from 1,017 to 268 in referrals, a 74% decline. Also, teachers in CMCD elementary schools indicated during the third year that they had been saving about 36 minutes daily as a result of CMCD practices, while middle school teachers indicated they had been saving 30-31 minutes daily (3.6 weeks annually), that would have been wasted on student conduct/disciplinary problems in preCMCD implementation years. In Newark, CMCD students, at the end of the first project implementation year, significantly outperformed their comparison cohort in math (effect size, 0.53; 70th percentile) and in reading (effect size, 0.26; 60 th percentile). This improvement in math performance among the students occurred even though the math component of the comprehensive reform model had not yet been installed.

We identify foreign inventive activity by applying the ‘cross-border-ownership concept’ to transnational patent applications. The descriptive analysis shows that foreign technological activity more than doubled during the observation period with persistent spatial heterogeneity in Germany. Using a pooled count data model, we estimate the effect of various sources for externalities on the extent of foreign technological activity across regions. Our results show that foreign technological activity is attracted by technologically specialised sectors of regions. In contrast to existing findings this effect applies both to foreign as well as domestic sources of specialisation. We show that the relation between specialization and foreign technological activity is non-linear and that it is influenced by sectoral heterogeneity.

"156968439","Prosecuting Collateral Consequences","Criminal law scholars have long agreed that prosecutors wield vast and largely unreviewable discretion in the criminal justice system. This Article argues that this discretion now extends beyond criminal penalties and broadly reaches civil public policy decisions, such as deportation and licensing. As a result of ubiquitous plea bargaining and collateral consequences — state-imposed civil penalties that are triggered by criminal convictions — prosecutors can deliberately exercise discretion to trigger or avoid important civil consequences. This aspect of prosecutorial discretion has been underexamined, partly because of a lack of awareness of collateral consequences. But as a result of important new initiatives designed to promote information about collateral consequences, prosecutors as well as defendants are becoming more likely to know that even minor convictions can trigger much more serious civil penalties. As some commentators have pointed out, prosecutors who are aware of collateral consequences may have powerful incentives to drop charges or otherwise structure pleas to minimize the likelihood of certain collateral consequences. But importantly, prosecutors also have strong structural incentives to take the opposite approach and reach pleas to maximize the likelihood of civil penalties. For some prosecutors, enforcing collateral consequences serves as an administratively efficient substitute for a criminal conviction, as a source of leverage, as a way to circumvent the requirements of criminal procedure, as a means of achieving deterrence or retribution, or as a way to promote their own public policy preferences. This Article develops an analytic framework for understanding the structural incentives that lead prosecutors to influence collateral consequences; exposes legal and ethical problems associated with plea bargaining in light of collateral consequences; and argues that collateral consequences can undermine important interests in transparency and accountability.",2016,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:156968439","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500
"155065802","Challenges Facing People with Disabilities and Possible Solutions in Tanzania","The first ever World report on disability, produced jointly by World Health Organization and the World Bank, suggests that more than a billion people in the world today experience disability Therefore, about 10 per cent of the world’s populations are PWDs. Out of the number said above, 80 per cent of PWDs live in developing countries. As for Tanzania in particular, the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Labour Organization (ILO)’s reports of 2007 estimated that there were more than 3 million people in Tanzania who have disability. Probably the number is still the same. The number includes both physical and mental disabilities. Reports and experience show that people with disabilities often face mistreatments in a number of ways and because of various reasons. In addition the World Bank has estimated that, 20 per cent of the most impoverished individuals are disabled. Evidently, women and children with disabilities are more susceptible to abuse, including physical and sexual violence as they may not receive sexual education and may be less able to defend themselves against sexual abuse and rape. Other reports indicate that, the mortality rates for people with disabilities are higher than persons without disabilities. Worse enough Tanzania Human Rights Report of 2010 which quotes the Disability Survey Report of the Government of Tanzania of 2008 confirms that, the current illiteracy rate for disabled persons in Tanzania is 47.6 per cent compared to 25.3 per cent of the people without a disability.

NAFTA instantly lifted duties on the majority of products and services produced by the signatory countries. It likewise requires the safe disposal, over a time of 15 years, of most remaining hindrances to cross-fringe investments and the development of products and services among the three nations. Before NAFTA, Canada and the United States were developed economies with good conventions of liberal political and monetary approaches, while Mexico had not one or the other. After World War II, Mexico occupied with protectionism and import-substitution, rather than fare drove development. Mexico's strategies were expected to make autonomy from American dominion and empower urban industrialization through state and corporatist approaches. These approaches reverse discharges and by the 1980s Mexico had triple-digit swelling, in reverse commercial enterprises and broad international obligation. In this environment, Mexico started to change in 1985 and tear down its protectionist arrangements. In any case, Mexican wages were still only one-seventh of those in the United States only preceding NAFTA. This made critical resistance to participation with Mexico in the United Sates, where American work and union gatherings dreaded significant employment misfortunes to Mexico. As far as it matters for Mexico, opening its economy as required by NAFTA debilitated political and financial leaders who had controlled and circulated state incomes without outside impedance.

They emerged in an ad hoc manner and, since the 1980s, have helped address the emergency food needs of those experiencing food poverty. Food Rescue organisations, a later creation, emerged in an organised and planned manner. They have helped to address the needs of those experiencing food poverty by increasing the quantity, and the amount of perishable food available for distribution. METHOD: This article draws on academic literature and research of the Dunedin/Otepoti newsprint media completed for a thesis in 2017 to provide background about how these organisations came to exist and the socio-political context that supports their existence. FINDINGS: The development of food banks in Dunedin/Ōtepoti reflected the global explanations for their rise; however, with the advent of KiwiHarvest the mechanisms for addressing food poverty are undergoing a paradigm shift. IMPLICATIONS: These new mechanisms have the potential to be more inclusive of those experiencing food poverty. Choice of food, involvement of recipients in the policy setting and the distribution of food, and fewer criteria are possible innovations. There are also opportunities for this new paradigm to extend and enhance the traditional role of food banks in conversations and actions that address social justice issues.",2019,"Aotearoa New Zealand Social Work","10.11157/anzswj-vol31iss4id671",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213918910","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

Antitrust policy can shape the nature and value of intellectual property rights by placing restrictions on the acquisition of intellectual property, refusals to deal, and the terms adopted in licensing agreements. Moreover, antitrust policy affects the nature of product-market competition, which in turn affects the returns to the acquisition and use of intellectual property. In the other direction, intellectual property policy can have significant effects on product-market competition and innovation—areas that are central concerns of antitrust policy. Today, it is fashionable to declaim that a historically perceived tension between intellectual property law and antitrust policy was overstated. The old view held that intellectual property rights regimes create monopolies to spur innovation, while competition policy seeks to eliminate monopolies.1 The modern view holds that both intellectual property law and antitrust policy seek to promote innovation and consumer welfare by creating an economic environment in which innovative activities are stimulated by both competition and the promise of returns to successful innovation.2",2002,"JTHTL",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44298731","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

Probably one of the bigger and more fundamental changes is the rise in the pension eligibility age. The fact that these reforms came quickly after the closing of early retirement opportunities urged the pre-pension cohorts to adjust their retirement outlooks. This research studied older workers’ emotional reactions to reforms that induce them to extend their working lives with a number of years. Using data from a large scale sample survey among 6,800 older workers in the Netherlands, aged 60–65 at time of interview in 2015, we examined why the pension reforms trigger stronger emotional reactions in some individuals than in others. We integrated theoretical insights from the theory of emotion and the resource-based perspective on retirement adjustment. Testing our hypotheses revealed that emotions are stronger among individuals that have less access to resources. Anger and worry is more prevalent among older workers in more demanding jobs, with less favorable personal (health, wealth) and social resources (no partner support). This research suggests that policy makers—mostly higher level professionals who are much less exposed to the challenges of working longer—have underestimated the psychological and social impact of the reforms on vulnerable groups of older workers and, in particular, less educated older workers with lower social status. With a further increase of retirement age to be expected, policy makers are challenged to design policies that spare vulnerable groups in particular, for example, by facilitating more flexibility in the retirement transition.",2017,"Work, Aging and Retirement","10.1093/workar/wax010",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55665739","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

The core argument made is that the BTC project is much more than a power resource; it is the core medium of interaction for international and regional actors (governmental, non-governmental and intergovernmental) because of the number of connections that it makes possible in a highly contingent world. In contrast to Great Game assumptions, it is argued that transnational infrastructures are not necessarily negative or positive; rather, what is important is to view their contribution, mixed impacts and limitations from a broader perspective.

The post-2005 discursive field of the Northern areas is, in many ways, more open-ended, complex and confusing than ever. The opening up and expansion of the concept of High North security means that ‘everything’ is seen as having a security potential. What does seem clear is the increasing presence of security in primary texts and the media debate: entry to and credibility in the discourse depends on ‘security speak’ across an ever-widening array of thematic contexts.

"213121867","Impact by design: Planning your research impact in 7Cs","Although supporting and assessing the non-academic “impact” of research are not entirely new developments in higher education, academics and research institutions are under increasing pressure to produce work that has a measurable influence outside the academy. With a view to supporting the solution of complex societal issues with evidence and expertise, and against the background of increased emphasis on impact in the United Kingdom’s 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF2021) and a proliferation of impact guides and tools, this article offers a simple, easy to remember framework for designing impactful research. We call this framework: “The 7Cs of Impact” – Context, Communities, Constituencies, Challenge, Channels, Communication and Capture. ::: Drawing on core elements of the Policy Institute at King’s College London’s Impact by Design training course and the authors’ practical experience in supporting and delivering impact, this paper outlines how this framework can help address key aspects across the lifecycle of a research project and plan, from identifying the intended impact of research and writing it into grants and proposals, to engaging project stakeholders and assessing whether the project has had the desired impact. ::: While preparations for current and future REF submissions may benefit from using this framework, this paper sets out the “7Cs” with a more holistic view of impact in mind, seeking to aid researchers in identifying, capturing, and communicating how research projects can and do contribute to the improvement in society.",2019,"Emerald Open Research","10.35241/emeraldopenres.13323.1",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213121867","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

"157308420","Do perceptions of corruption influence personal income taxpayer reporting behaviour? Evidence from Indonesia","This paper addresses an identified gap in knowledge about whether, and how, perceptions of corruption may influence personal income taxpayer compliance behaviour. It examines how perceptions of five forms of corruption may impact upon intentional tax underreporting behaviour by adopting a sequential mixed-methods approach. Initially, a qualitative phase was carried out by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with nine participants (three taxpayers, three tax agents and three tax officers). The secondand corephase of the research involved extensive data collection using a mixed-modes field survey conducted through 12 tax offices across four Indonesian regions. A total of 397 respondents were surveyed, comprising 196 self-employed and 201 employed taxpayers. Three principal findings have emerged from the data. First, as expected, the data from both the qualitative and quantitative phases suggest that high levels of perceived corruption were evident in Indonesia. Second, the quantitative findings clearly demonstrate that perceptions of corruption undermine taxpayers' intention to report actual income. Third, the findings ultimately suggest that high levels of perceived general corruption (that is, abuse of entrusted power by public officials for private gain), grand corruption (that is, corruption involving high-level public officials) and grand tax-corruption (that is, corruption involving high-level tax officials) were influential on intentional tax underreporting behaviour. The present empirical results support the notions that perceptions of corruption are important determinants and have a negative impact upon tax compliance behaviour. The results also imply that combating corruption, especially grand corruption, would have a beneficial effect on voluntary tax compliance in Indonesia.",2016,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:157308420","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

The objective of this article is to analyse and identify their distinguishing features as well as their significance and implications for the further functioning of the Croatian political scene. Owing to the fact that in both electoral cycles an important voice in the shape of the ruling coalition went to the party that came third in the election and, also surprisingly, this was both a newly established formation and to a great extent with an anti-establishment appeal, particular attention is focused on the appearance on the party scene of new political groupings.

The deliberate and brutal targeting of civilians has been an increasingly pronounced feature of this conflict, contributing to acute civilian vulnerability. Often ascribed to the specific ideological and ethno-religious configuration of Boko Haram, we argue that this violence is similar to that of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), tactically and in the evolution of both groups over time. In addition, violence inflicted on civilians by both groups has necessitated complex strategies of civilian navigation of insecurity risks, including the establishment of informal local security providers.

Language is the literary and linguistic tool which literary artists deploy for the conveyance of their individual artistic visions and sensibilities in literature. Political corruption is the major cause of the socio-political problems in Nigeria. The contemporary Nigerian literary artists deploy the language of satire as a means of exposing the socio-political problems responsible for poverty and underdevelopment in Nigeria. Moreover, they advance the measures to proffer lasting solutions to the socio-political problems, in order to usher in growth and development. Nigerian political leaders are exploitative and corrupt. They are not only exploiting Nigerians, but have plunged them into abject poverty and hardship through corrupt practices and bad governance. Unlike what obtains in many developed countries, politics in Nigeria like in most African countries is characterized by corrupt practices due to avarice and greed associated with political leadership.

In this commentary, we argue that (1) the PPH label at times implies a coherence of ideas, values and priorities that may not be present; (2) it is important and timely to work towards a more unified PPH; and (3) both challenges to and opportunities for a more unified PPH exist, which we illustrate using the broad areas of research funding, the public health workforce and PPH ethics.",2017,"Health promotion and chronic disease prevention in Canada : research, policy and practice","10.24095/hpcdp.37.7.03",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10185533","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

In this paper we describe our experience running an NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Computer Science and Engineering (CS&E), an area where these problems have been recently exacerbated and where under-represented minority student groups with important growth rates have had a very low participation. The most important aspects that need to be included in these programs to address these concerns and some other initiatives that can bring additional benefits at low cost are also described. For each of these aspects, successful strategies or best practices are included. Finally, the effectiveness of the program is demonstrated with the results of the program evaluation. 1.

Through official guidance and funded projects, the Horizon 2020 programme, the EU has positioned nature at the centre of landscape and urban planning debates. However, there remains a scepticism regarding whether the support of NBS as an alternative to green infrastructure (GI) planning is meaningful and appropriate or damaging to existing practices. Furthermore, the framing of NBS does not, to date, extend the conceptual, practical or political parameters of ‘green space’ planning beyond terminological changes. Its most significant contribution to urban planning is the emphasis it places on urban ecology as a foundational principle of all development. To assess the added value of NBS in the planning and management of urban landscapes the paper reflects on the academic discussions surrounding the approach. This examines how NBS are being used to shape support for investment in urban nature but also argues that it potentially creates a schism between advocates of existing green space terminology and approaches. It concludes by setting the parameters for further analysis of how NBS are being, and may be used, going forward to socio-economic and ecological agendas in the EU.",2019,NA,"10.7275/0n91-xq04",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:189095696","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500
"12880361","Measuring the effect of family income on undergraduate behavior","Educational equality has been an important and relevant issue in recent years, especially as tuition increases at colleges and universities make it increasingly difficult for low and middleincome families to afford education for their children. There are even more issues of educational equality that come into play once a student matriculates at a chosen school. This paper focuses on this area, expanding on existing literature that details family income’s impact on undergraduate behavior. Academic pursuits have been a topic for prior research in this area, but this paper also models extracurricular behavior as a function of family income. Results show that income does play a role in student decision-making, but it does not seem to place lower-income students at any disadvantage to their peers. Introduction Colleges and universities throughout the United States have long offered financial aid to disadvantaged students. As tuition increases continue to outpace inflation, financial need has moved up the income spectrum such that middle-class families are increasingly priced out of the market. As a result, many higher education institutions have been making efforts to extend financial aid beyond low-income students. This phenomenon is especially evident at private, prestigious universities; over the past two years, many of these institutions have been racing to expand aid to cover students from middle and even upper-middle class backgrounds. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Stanford are among the notable selective universities in this group. The New York Times published an article at the end of 2007 titled “Harvard’s Aid to Middle Class Pressures Rivals.” In this extreme case, financial aid at Harvard has been expanded to include any student whose family income falls below $180,000. Harvard’s decision was quickly followed by similar changes at the University of Pennsylvania, Swarthmore, and Haverford. Theoretically, providing financial aid to more than just the poorest families should attract students from all economic backgrounds, not just the extremes, increasing equity in educational accessibility. This paper will look at one effect of these generous financial aid policies by analyzing undergraduate behavioral differences across income levels, once students have matriculated at a specific university. These extensive financial aid policies are designed to equalize the burden to pay for families across the income spectrum – or at least to lessen this difference. This implies that students’ behavior should not be influenced by the need to pay off deep student loans or to contribute excessively toward their tuition bills. Are these policies effective in actually leveling",2009,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12880361","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

"51624773","Putting People First: Critical Reforms for Canada's Health Care System.","For over 70 years, since the Dominion Provincial Conferences at the end of the Second World War, Canadians have viewed health care as a right of citizenship. The Canada Health Act (CHA, 1984) formally entrenched the five principles that guide our current publicly operated, single payer, provincially managed system: public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability and accessibility. The health care system that has sprung up around the CHA has become increasingly complex, costly and strained. Our gradual descent through the rankings of major health care suggests that we are reaching the limits of what the current health care system can provide. Unfortunately, constructive political debate around this issue is often choked by intense ideological positioning. System reform is urgently needed to address the rapidly changing biological and demographic drivers of health. We do not feel that diverting ever larger flows of money into the status quo is a sustainable solution. Our nation's health and the means to advance it must be seen as assets rather than costs. We believe it is possible to meet increasing demands by expanding the supply and acknowledging the wealth of resources (scientific, human, managerial and educational) that we currently possess. In this paper we propose a cultural shift from an institution-centered system bent on cost control, to a patient-centered system that fosters a true health economy. We identify a series of interventions (some bold and others less so) to achieve a clear and evaluable goal: maximizing the well-being and debility-free life expectancy of each individual. To achieve a patient-centred system-we discuss strategies to address costs and utilization, the setting of real performance standards, the elimination of conflicts of interest and the provision of truly accessible care for all Canadians. To create a health economy, we discuss the importance of innovation, the need for a reinvigorated public health system and steps to overhaul the health care human resources environment. The goal of health care reform in Canada should be a system that is dynamic, evidence based, wealth creating and a global leader. We believe that, with leadership and vision, this goal is eminently achievable.",2017,"Health law in Canada",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51624773","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

"134959730","Political ecology of Costa Rica’s climate policy: contextualizing climate governance","Climate change is a global problem with distinct local impacts that challenge the application of universal policy mechanisms. Climate governance is the broad multiscalar, mixed method approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It is founded on neoliberal market logics that commodify carbon, while also attempting to be socially and environmentally sustainable. This research focuses on hydroelectricity, a climate governance mechanism that is simultaneously promoted as a solution to climate change and critiqued for its negative social and environmental impacts. This paradox is explored by assessing the assemblage of interactions occurring within Costa Rica, a place known for their sustainable development and renewable energy production. Local indigenous communities, state, and non-state actors voice a diverse array of perspectives regarding construction of the Diquis hydroelectric project, which the state promotes as a key component of its climate plan. To some indigenous peoples, the project is a threat to their landscapes, livelihoods, and cultures; to others, its delay results in missed economic opportunities. In this paper, I utilize political ecology to explore these diverse perspectives in order to contextualize the local dynamics of global climate governance, providing insights for both climate policy in Costa Rica and climate governance mechanisms broadly.",2018,"Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences","10.1007/s13412-018-0480-y",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134959730","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

"142604669","The Silencing of Women: The Irish Abortion Laws and Religion","Abstract This essay attempts to look at the unfortunate circumstances that surround women in Ireland in regards to abortion. Rather than looking at the pro- and anti-life arguments which are commonly discussed when approaching abortion issues, I have chosen to concentrate on the legal and ethical matters in Ireland that seem to have control over Irish women's bodies and consequently their personhood. Through the investigation of the changing Irish laws brought about by the Grogan and X cases, it is possible to understand how religious and patriarchal sentiment has continued to suppress women's personal choice in regards to abortion. By looking at the support for Roman Catholic morals in Ireland, I suggest that Irish women remain in a weak position with regards to equal life choices due to the fear of public shame that is associated with abortion and aim to show how as a result their voices have been silenced. Keywords: abortion, Ireland, religion ********** If the self is an individual's awareness of a unique identity, the 'person' is society's confirmation of that identity as of social significance. (La Fontaine, qtd. in Carrithers et al. 124) Since society considers a person to require an identity and in turn a self in order to attain citizenship and personhood, the argument of anti- and pro-abortion campaigns concern when actual personhood is truly developed and therefore certifiable: at moment of conception, quickening or after birth? This is the argument commonly made regarding abortion. However, in this essay I want to highlight the issue of a woman's own fight to personhood; this subject is often lost in the battle over who controls women's reproduction in regards to abortion. I shall argue that despite the broadcasted equality women are said to receive within the political sphere of society, for example in employment rights, it would seem that women are not recognised as responsible, rational adults regarding their reproductive lives, which is the single most private concern of many women. The appropriate question to ask is: if women do not control their choices about abortion, who does, and through which methods? I shall investigate how in the case of Ireland, anti-abortion activists have manipulated the religious foundations of the Roman Catholic Church in order to influence public opinion on abortion law processes, which have in turn oppressed women's rights to express independent choice about reproduction. In order to do this I must first describe the past and present abortion laws within Ireland with regard to the restrictions they place on women; I shall introduce the X and Grogan cases as key moments highlighting the difficulty of such laws. By understanding the legal situation it is then possible to discuss how the position of Ireland as an extremely religious state has applied moral principles to explain the rights and wrongs of abortion, and how this has reinforced an anti-abortion societal attitude. I shall underline in brief the hidden controls religious institutions have in society and how pro-life groups such as the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC) have used such influences as their line of attack against liberating abortion laws. In conclusion I shall show through consideration of the above factors how women have been forced into keeping their views about abortion hidden. How does the Irish legal system constrain the women's rights regarding reproductive choice? The answer lies in the provision of the abortion law. Since there are people who regard abortion as murder, abortion cannot be recognized as a private matter between consenting adults, so the law is enlisted to provide set protocol on the issue (Oppenheimer 47). However it must be understood that any legal practice regarding abortion can have a repressive effect on women's individual and bodily rights. This is because the law operates by constructing its own image of the legal subject it seeks to regulate, one that is based upon the reasonable man (Sheldon 20). …",2005,"Journal of international women's studies",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:142604669","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

There are no clear boundaries between the personal and social attributes of ‘race’, ethnicity, religion, culture, nationality or national origin. Is the Racial Equality Directive, as the key legislative tool for combating racial or ethnic discrimination in EC law, wide enough or does it go far enough to successfully address different aspects of contemporary racism? The Directive prohibits discrimination on the ground of ‘racial or ethnic origin’, but no definition is given of the meaning of ‘racial or ethnic origin’, while nationality as a ground of discrimination is expressly excluded from its scope, and religion is covered by a different directive. Additionally, the concept of equality underlying the Directive is situated between equality of treatment and a more substantive view of equality, with its remedial model mostly based on the ‘individual justice model’ and with the limits of positive action to be allowed under the Directive still unknown.

"154903151","The New Vulnerability: Data Security and Personal Information","This book chapter was originally written for a conference on privacy and security at Stanford Law School held in March 2004. The chapter argues that abuses of personal information are caused by the failure to regulate the way companies manage personal information. Despite taking elaborate technological measures to protect their data systems, companies readily disseminate the personal information they have collected to a host of other entities and sometimes even to anyone willing to pay a small fee. Companies provide access to their record systems over the phone to anybody in possession of a few easy-to-find pieces of personal information such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, and mothers' maiden names. Reforming this problematic state of affairs requires a rethinking of the way the law comprehends the abuse of personal information. The law fails to focus on the causes of information abuses; instead, it becomes involved when information misuses such as identity theft actually occur, not earlier on in the process.

Countries with fewer health professionals have poorer health outcomes compared with countries that have more. Despite major gains in health indicators, Rwanda still suffers from a severe shortage of health professionals.This article describes a partnership launched in 2005 by Rwanda's Ministry of Health with the U.S. nongovernmental organization Partners In Health and with Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. The partnership has expanded to include the Faculty of Medicine and the School of Public Health at the National University of Rwanda and other Harvard-affiliated academic medical centers. The partnership prioritizes local ownership and-with the ultimate goals of strengthening health service delivery and achieving health equity for poor and underserved populations-it has helped establish new or strengthen existing formal educational programs (conferring advanced degrees) and in-service training programs (fostering continuing professional development) targeting the local health workforce.

"150590846","Omissions, Acts, and the Security Council's (in)Actions in Syria","This essay, written for the Boston University International Law Journal's symposium on The Next Season: Realigning International Law and Western Policy After the Arab Spring, explores the responsibilities of Security Council members for abuses perpetrated in foreign humanitarian crises. As death tolls mount and massive violations of human rights continue in Syria, the Security Council plods along, doing little to respond to the escalating violence there. Some have portrayed the Council as a mere bystander, an onlooker with no connection to or responsibility for the atrocities undertaken by others. In another view, the Council is not merely standing by, but instead is complicit in the violence because it does nothing. Drawing on insights from the criminal law, this essay considers how we can better understand what it means to be a bystander in the context of humanitarian crises. Specifically, this essay examines two questions. First, it considers whether the resistance of Anglo-American criminal law to bystander liability should be replicated in the context of international affairs. Investigating the rationales for limited bystander liability in criminal law and the distinct rationales present in international law, this essay argues that even though the responsibility of the Security Council for international peace and security provides a strong reason for placing heightened expectations on the Council in the event of humanitarian crises, distinct concerns in international law caution against treating Council members as obligated to intervene in foreign states. Second, this essay draws on the criminal law distinction between acts and omissions to explore whether Security Council conduct in the context of humanitarian crises should properly be labeled participation or inaction. I contend that in light of the Security Council’s defined role under the U.N. Charter, a lack of involvement on the part of the Council should be understood as an affirmative choice, rather than as a failure to act. Exploring the broader moral intuitions of both criminal law and international law about the conduct of certain actors toward suffering caused by third parties, this essay seeks to illuminate some assumptions at work in our understanding of the Security Council’s role in humanitarian crises, thus furthering debates about the Council and humanitarian intervention, a crucial question in contemporary international law and politics.",2013,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150590846","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

It also analyses their legal basis based on the Jasser Auda’s maqāṣid al-sharī’ah approach concerning the preservation of life and treasure. The primariy objective of this article is to find the main differences between the KHI and the Verdict in determining the nafkah iddah of divorce suit. Although some scholars have concerned about the case of nafkah iddah , the Jasser Auda’s maqāṣid al-sharī’ah approach seems to be rare to be dealt with the case. Accordingly, the maqāṣidi approach will be mainly utilised in order to consider the effectiveness of both the KHI and the Verdict. This article finds that the KHI states that a wife who applies for a divorce is considered disloyal. As a consequence, she is undeserving of receiving nafkah iddah . The additional finding is that the Verdict decides that in the case of the divorce filled by the ex-wife, it brings a responsibility for the former husband to pay the nafkah iddah . From the perspective of maqāṣid al-sharī’ah , this article argues that the implementation of the Verdict gains better benefit rather than the KHI, because the legal basis evolved for the nafkah iddah of divorce suit is in line with the maqāṣid principles of the preservation of life and property.

Realism provides the standard answer: shared threat motivates deeper cooperation. In a recent article, Ryan Bock offers a liberal antidote to this conventional view, leveraging insights on domestic regime type to explain why Anglo-Soviet sharing remained shallow despite the German threat during 1941–5. Several shortcomings in Bock’s innovative study undermine his main arguments and findings. A reevaluation of the Anglo-Soviet case and a cursory examination of nine other intelligence-sharing relationships during the Second World War reveal a spread of variation in the depth of cooperation that cannot be explained by a liberal regime-type argument, a realist threat perspective, or other prevailing International Relations paradigms.

"62881339","Values and Attitudes Towards Innovation Among Canadian, Chinese and Russian Students","This study investigated relations of basic personal values to attitudes towards innovation among students in Russia, Canada, and Nhina. Participants completed a questionnaire that included the SVS measure of values (Schwartz, 1992) and a new measure of attitudes towards innovation (Lebedeva, Tatarko, 2009). There are significant cultural and gender-related differences in value priorities and innovative attitudes among the Canadian, Russian, and Chinese college students. As hypothesized, across the full set of participants, higher priority given to Opennes to change values (self-direction, stimulation) related to positive attitudes toward innovation whereas higher priority given to Conservation values (conformity, security) related negatively. This is compatible with the results reported by other researchers (Shane, 1992, 1995; Dollinger, Burke & Gump, 2007). There were, however, culture-specific variations in some of these associations, which may be explained by cultural differences in value priorities or meanings and in implicit theories of creativity and innovation. Applying the Multiple-Group Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes Model (MGMIMIC) (Muthen 1989) has shown that the type of Values-Innovation mediation is different in the three countries. Whereas in Russia and Canada the effects of gender and age are fully mediated by the values, this is not true for China, where a direct effect of gender on innovation was found. The cultural differences in values, implicit theories of innovation, and their consequences for attitudes to innovation and personal well-being is finally discussed",2012,"SSRN Electronic Journal","10.2139/ssrn.2008139",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62881339","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

The latter plan would reflect both the great powers’ special responsibilities for maintaining international peace and security and the stake which lesser powers had in such a venture.

"155988807","China - Africa culture differences in business relations","With the Chinese rapid industrial development, there became a need for importation of oil and minerals (that is, iron ore, bauxite, nickel, copper), which Africa have in great quantity. For that, China now becomes Africa’s second largest trading partner after U.S. As a result of this, bilateral trade with Africa reached $114 billion in 2008, up from $65.9 billion in 2007. This was as a result of the government’s “going global policy”, which encouraged Chinese companies to become multinationals, and therefore supported a rise in China’s foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa to $5.4 billion in 2009, up from a negligible amount just a decade ago. In spite of Africa – China relationship, there appears to be culture related differences which need to be studied for greater mutual understanding. The objective of this topic therefore, is more or less to minimize misunderstandings through an awareness of the priorities and expectations of business partners for greater world economy. In so doing, this study was able to discuss some differences in Africa and Chinese business cultures. It therefore explained the connection between culture and business. It went on to clarify the differences between China and Africa by focusing on Hofstede’s four cultural dimensions: power distance, individualism/collectivism, masculinity/femininity, and uncertainty avoidance and Bond’s dimension about long-term/short-term orientation also called “Confucian dynamism”. The paper tried to explain their cultural differences in business strategies, conflict management, decision-making risk-taking/risk-avoiding, decision-making, work-group characteristics, and motivation systems. It made it known that whereas Chinese has something to do with guanxi (relationship) that helps them not to lose face in business, African never think of such. The paper concludes that knowing another culture is a legitimate concern of businesses. More than that, it is essential. Those who make effort to understand another culture gain knowledge about how to behave in that culture. Otherwise, if one knows what people value and understand their attitudes, one would not unintentionally do something that offends and diminishes one’s chances for business success. ::: ::: ::: ::: Key words: China – Africa, culture, differences, business, relations, guanxi.",2012,"African Journal of Political Science and International Relations","10.5897/AJPSIR11.130",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155988807","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500
"55412100","Political economy of reform","This paper reviews the literature relevant to understanding political constraints to economic reforms. Reform refers to changes in government policies or institutional rules because status quo policies and institutions are not working well to achieve the goals of economic well-being and development. Further, reforms refer to the alternative policies and institutions that are available that would most likely perform better than the status quo. The main question examined in the political economy of reform literature has been why reforms are not undertaken when they are needed for the good of society. The succinct answer from the first generation of research is that conflict of interest between organized socio-political groups is responsible for some groups being able to stall reforms so that they can extract greater private rents from status quo policies. The next generation of research is tackling a more fundamental question: why does conflict of interest persist; or, why do some interest groups exert influence against reforms if there are indeed large gains to be had for society?

"155429649","Student Leadership, Participation and Democracy","This article analyses modes of participation which enable schools to develop as democratic communities of learning and leadership. It mines a rich vein of work sustained at Cambridge over many years. Contributors to this work have included Jean Rudduck, Michael Fielding, Donald McIntyre, John MacBeath and Madeleine Arnot. The modes of participation considered include student voice or consultation, students as researchers, participative pedagogy and student leadership. These resonate with the values of the Leadership for Learning (LfL) endeavour (MacBeath & Dempster, 2009) in which shared leadership is a cornerstone. This article explores the relationship between the key concepts of learning, participation and democracy. It draws its analysis from a series of key projects initiated under the umbrella of LfL in Cambridge in recent years, including the „Influence and Participation of Young People in their Learning‟ project (MacBeath et al., 2008), the „Evaluation of the Learning to Lead Initiative‟ project (Frost & MacBeath, 2010) and the „Student Leadership for School Improvement‟ project (Roberts & Nash, 2010). All of these projects have enabled students at a variety of ages to exercise leadership and become full partners in the enterprise of learning. The analysis illuminates the links between the agency of learners, the development of their capacity for leadership and the growth of holistic democracy (Woods & Woods, 2011).",2011,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155429649","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

Social media analysis of Twitter can be used to understand which sentiment and opinions are implicit in these social media data. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach of natural language pre-processing, text mining, and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze Twitter data related to Afghanistan through a case study. Our article analyzes the Twitter English data about Afghanistan. The value of the proposed approach was to understand the most discomforts and happiness of people, their opinions, and the country situation in the different time through a case study. We found that from 29 March 2018 to 12 Jun 2018 almost always negative comments are higher than positives while from 13 Jun 2018 to 21 Jun 2018 it is just opposite, the positive comments are higher than negative comments on Twitter. The reason for this was the interim peace for a few days that had taken place between Afghan government and the Taliban terrorist group. The outcomes of this research can help the palpitations, companies, and stockholders to use social media network as a great information source for their better political strategies and better business decision-making for their current and future intentions.

"153799415","The International Criminal Court","The International Criminal Court (the ICC) is an independent institution and the world's first international permanent criminal court. The ICC was created via a multi-lateral treaty; the Rome Statute adopted by the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court 17 July, 1998 in Rome (see Appendix F.1 for the text of the Rome Statute). This is unlike the situation with the other international criminal courts so far discussed; the ICTR, ICTY and SCSL. The latter courts have a mandate which ends after a defined period of time. The ICTR, ICTY and SCSL were set up by the United Nations Security Council in response to the need to respond to specific situations that occurred in these jurisdictions and avoid the perpetrators of international crimes involved in those particular situations escaping justice. The Assembly of States (comprised of the State Parties to the Rome Statute) is the body that has oversight over the ICC and is responsible for any legislative decisions affecting the legal instruments guiding the operation of ICC. The States Parties to the Rome Statute have a legal obligation under that treaty to cooperate with the International Criminal Court. As of 14 November, 2008, there were 108 States Parties (States which had ratified the Rome Statute), but these did not include a number of major powers such as the United States, Russia, and China. There is also an agreement between the United Nations and the ICC which sets out institutional co-operative relations that allows, for instance, for exchange of information, etc. (i.e., the United Nations may have confidential documents relevant to a case being prosecuted by the ICC which it will share with the ICC subject to certain confidentiality provisions. This in order that the Prosecutor may use the information provided by the United Nations to develop further evidence).

"55541881","GLOBALIZATION AND AFRICAN SELF - DETERMINATION","One of the major features of international relations in the twentieth century was the increasing wave and process of globalization. This increase in the process and form of globalization which coincided with the unpolar world system operated by liberal capitalism and headed by the United States of America brings up a number of issues. One of such issues is the impact of globalization on the development and self-image of African states and people. This is because globalization is a broad process that permeates the whole world with far-reaching ramifications covering economic, political and cultural dimensions of contemporary life, and according to Jibrim Ibrahim, one of its most important characteristics is that it produces winners and losers. Thus, this paper argues that if there is any serious challenge confronting African state today, it is the threat of total marginalization from what is taking place in the global economy. This position is supported by the fact that in Africa, the dominant form of globalization means a historical loss in the economy of livelihoods and mode of existence; in politics, a loss in the degree of control exercised by territorial states such that the locus of power gradually shifts in varying proportions above and below the territorial state; and in culture, a devaluation of a people’s achievement or perceptions of them. This paper, therefore, examines the impact of globalization on Africa’s development and self – determination and how African states and people can assert relevance in a globalized world. The paper concludes by asserting that the threat of marginalization of Africa from the benefits of globalization imposes special responsibilities on African intellectuals and leadership to re-examine globalization and what it stands for, as well as define an alternative ideological and institutional framework within which Africa’s development and self-determination can be achieved.",2012,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55541881","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

"153457914","The importance of a whole of community approach to using social media for disaster resilience and how the Emergency 2.0 Wiki can help","Social media offers the potential to play a transformative role in making disaster resilience a social norm. Social media can help communities create a level of resilience that ensures they donâ€™t just â€˜bounce backâ€™ after a disaster, but â€˜bounce forwardâ€™, becoming stronger with increased social networks, social cohesion and social capital. This requires a â€˜whole of communityâ€™ approach to using social media for disaster resilience, in which the community becomes partners in disaster resilience. Along with emergency services, government, NGOs, schools, hospitals, community groups, business, media and citizens can all play a role in using social media to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters. Despite the rising popularity of using social media in disasters, it is still not a normal part of mainstream emergency communications globally. Also there are few instances where a whole of community approach is applied. What is needed is capacity building by providing the â€˜know howâ€™ for using the new technologies in the disaster context, and empowerment by providing access to the tools to enable the community to help themselves and help each other.Â The Emergency 2.0 Wiki, a free global online resource for using social media and new technologies in emergencies, is helping close this knowledge gap and increase the takeup of social media for community resilience. The wiki provides tips, guides, mobile apps, mapping tools, videos, accessibility toolkit and an international directory of emergency agencies on social media. It has tips for citizens and guidelines for emergency services, governments, schools, hospitals, community groups and business.

"55965928","Culture and Corruption: An Explanation of the differences between Scandinavia and Africa","Corruption has been the cause of the failure of many countries. Part of any international business strategy is understanding the levels of corruption that exist within a country. This paper examines the issues of corruption in some of the least corrupt countries in the world and in some of the most corrupt countries in the world. The paper looks at the role of culture in determining how much corruption a country is expected to have. This paper will show that cultural variables like power distance and masculinity play a role in determining the level of corruption and how these cultural variables can help shape a country. Part of any international business strategy is having an understanding of the corruption levels that exist within a country. Scandinavia (Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, and Norway) have some of the lowest perceived corruption levels in the world while East, West, and Southern Africa have the highest. Why is this? What is it that makes these two regions so different? This paper will address some of the cultural issues (masculinity and power distance) that could contribute to the corruption levels in these two regions to be so diametrically opposed. This paper will show that as the masculinity index within a country increases so does the corruption index. In addition, the paper will also show that as the power distance increases, corruption will also increase. Finally, the paper will look at the moderating effect that power distance has on the relationship between masculinity and corruption.

Despite the ubiquity and persistence of the problem, the very nature of poverty remains poorly understood. This paper shows that to adequately recognize and understand poverty, its nature and extent should be examined from the spatial perspective. The nexus between poverty and the environment is close only when it is considered from the spatial perspective. Using geographical characteristics to explain disparities that underlie spatial perspective of poverty, it is observed that the livelihoods, health and vulnerability of the people are determined predominantly by the context in which they live and the constraints and opportunities this location presents. This spatial conceptualization of poverty gives rise to rural and urban perspectives. In the rural context, the natural capital is the fundamental building blocks of rural livelihoods, whereas in urban livelihoods, recognition is given to the nature of urban settlements and infrastructure (physical capital). It is concluded that urban poverty is much more complex and challenging that rural poverty. The paper therefore suggests that for sustainable poverty reduction in Africa, the environment should be explored to allow an understanding of how environmental constraints generate or exacerbate poverty, as each spatial location presents unique characteristics that require corresponding unique prescriptions",2014,"Global Journal of Human-Social Science Research",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:154801370","Political Science",0.25,2323,0.02460231725657156,21356,500

Oddly, though, the opinion was written by Justice Stevens, one of the staunchest devotees of a living Constitution rather than originalism. As odd: Justice Thomas, the most consistent originalist on the Court, was in dissent. In his view, any reinvigoration of the Privileges or Immunities Clause should displace, rather than augment, the untethered jurisprudence that expansively interpreted other clauses of the 14th Amendment to cover the neutered Privileges or Immunities Clause, and it should be revived as originally contemplated.

As we show through analysis of three cases Italy and Slovenia, Slovenia and Croatia, and Greece and Macedonia the EU’s transformative power does not always flow ‘outwards’ towards the state seeking membership. This raises interesting questions about enlargement as international bargaining between sovereign states filtered via a supranational entity formally responsible for the negotiations. Our cases suggest limits to the EU’s transformative power in the context of disputes that are linked to the meaning and significance of borders. When enlargement intersects with identity politics, the result can be potentially destabilizing in ways that can lead to a decline in the EU’s legitimacy.

This study examined whether participants with public speaking anxiety showed deficits in incidental emotion regulation compared to non-anxious participants. Ninety-five public speaking anxious and fifteen non-anxious participants completed an affect-labeling task. They viewed negative images, and on half of the trials, they labeled the content of the image, and on the other half, viewed the image without labeling. They then rated their subjective distress after each image. Following the affect-labeling task, participants gave a brief speech in front of a live audience. Physiological reactivity (heart rate and skin conductance) was assessed prior to and following the speech, and participants reported on speech-related cognitions and fear levels. Incidental emotion regulation deficits were significantly correlated with more depressive symptoms, and more negative and fewer positive speech-related cognitions during the speech task. Further, distress decreased on labeling compared to non-labeling trials for non-anxious participants, but not for participants with public speaking anxiety.

"149765490","PRESCHOOL TEACHERS AND THEIR LEVELS OF INTEREST IN DEVELOPING MUSICAL COMPETENCIES","As a contribution to creating a supportive environment in preschool institutions which could simultaneously foster the development of not only knowledge and skills, but also of the child’s entire personality, it is expected that preschool institutions, with the assistance of creative, efficacious and highly motivated teachers, should provide for such an environment through their programs. The ongoing changes in the educational system are aimed at supporting various creative activities for children, and they require that the preschool teacher should daily conduct activities which stimulate the child’s creative expression, performance, and research. Teachers play a primary role if we want to achieve so complex goals and tasks of preschool education with specific emphasis on the implementation of musical activities. This is why continuous professional training and improvement of musical competences are important for preschool teachers. By April 2016, in order to learn the degree to which preschool teachers are interested in improving the knowledge needed to implement the planned musical activities, the authors conducted a study concerning preschool teachers with various levels of professional experience and formal education. The goal of the study was to test to what extent preschool teachers were interested in professional improvement in the domain of music, and whether additional professional training provided them with more satisfaction in preparing and implementing musical activities. The conclusion is that preschool teachers are interested in professional advancement in music. Most think that they can further their skills and didactic competencies in the field through organizing professional seminars which could provide additional quality in early music education, strongly boosting further development of competencies with children.",2017,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149765490","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500
"56061806","Assessing how students learn in team-based learning: Validation of the Knowledge Re-Consolidation Inventory","Abstract Purpose The purpose of the present study was to establish the construct validity of a new instrument to measure psychological learning processes associated with Team-based learning (TBL), the Knowledge Re-Consolidation Inventory (KRCI). The instrument was designed to measure six factors: (1) self-guided preparation, (2) knowledge consolidation, (3) retrieval practice, (4) peer elaboration, (5) feedback, and (6) transfer of knowledge. Method Two samples were taken, consisting in total of 197 first- and second-year medical students from Singapore. To establish the construct validity of the KRCI, two confirmatory factor analyses were conducted (CFA). First, an exploration sample ( N =90) was taken from the second-year medical students to conduct a preliminary CFA, and it resulted in elimination of items with poor psychometric properties. A confirmatory sample ( N =107) was then taken from the first-year medical students to conduct a second CFA to cross-validate the KRCI with reduced items. Results From the original 38 items, 16 remained. The resulting model fitted the data well. The second CFA with the cross-validation sample replicated the findings of the first analysis and supported the factorial structure of the hypothesised six-factor model. Tests of factorial invariance demonstrate that the factorial structure of the KRCI was stable across measurements. Discussion The results of the study suggest that the KRCI is a valid and reliable instrument capable of measuring the six psychological mechanisms underlying TBL.",2017,"Health Professions Education","10.1016/j.hpe.2017.10.001",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56061806","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

Cursive handwriting was replaced by manuscript to teach in the first grade. Students are going to write only with cursive handwriting during their academic education. This change in the curriculum effects teachers because they must write with cursive handwriting in the lessons, too. All teachers in every branch must learn to write with cursive handwriting even if they teach handwriting or not. Class teachers try to teach cursive handwriting but in the lessons of branch teachers problems can be occurred about cursive handwriting. Beside this most of the teacher training programs don’t have course about teaching handwriting except primary school teachers’ and Turkish teachers training programs’. The aim of this study is to develop a scale to measure handwriting anxiety of teachers.

"150364619","Rise and be surprised: Aspectual profiling and mirativity in Odia light verb constructions","Abstract In this paper, we present our Construction Grammar account of light verb constructions in the Indo-Aryan language Odia (earlier known as Oriya). These light verb constructions are asymmetric complex verb predicates that combine a main verb (MV) with a light verb (LV). While the LVs are form-identical with a lexical verb, they are “light” because they have lost their lexical content as well as their argument structure. We argue that LV constructions present a coherent system: (i) they all modulate the interpretation of the event encoded by the main verb by adding a particular aspectual (phasal) profile on the event (i.e. profiling the ONSET, DURATION or COMPLETION of the event) and (ii) some of these light verbs further add a mirative interpretation. The present paper focuses on this subset of “aspectuo-mirative LVs” which can be characterised as non-parasitic expressions of mirativity; in particular, it presents new work on the light verb -uʈh ‘-rise’ that combines a profile on ONSET with mirativity. The constructional view that we present here offers an account of light verbs that is both descriptively and theoretically innovative. Its descriptive value resides in its systematic and fine-grained corpus-based analysis of the formal and semantic features of LVs beyond what is found in the existing literature. The theoretical contribution of our paper not only resides in offering a better understanding of the status of LVs in the grammar, but by situating the semantic value of some of these in the complex category of mirativity, it offers a more unified answer of quite disparate observations in the literature. Finally, we also address the question of whether this mirative value of the aspectuo-mirative LVs is semantic or pragmatic. As we will show, such a strict dichotomy cannot be maintained, which gives further support for a constructional approach.",2018,"Cognitive Linguistics","10.1515/cog-2017-0053",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150364619","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

Dialectical constructivism informs dialectical learning pedagogy, where students constantly interact with each other in developing and refining arguments over an issue from multiple perspectives. With the advancement of the Internet, it is possible to design dialectical learning activities with technologies that can be seamlessly integrated into curriculum and facilitate learning. In this paper, we designed a prototype of a dialectical learning system, CriticalThinker, that engages students with dialectical constructivist activities, with technology affordances such as anchoring the group discussion on top of screen to serve as a reference for following discussions, displaying multiple arguments in one screen, and visualizing relationships among the arguments as a structured way for students to argue with each other.

The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare 2003) was administered to 139 Italian offenders who were convicted of violent crimes (murder, rape, child sexual abuse, armed robbery, assault causing bodily harm). First, we explored whether the two PCL-R items theoretically denoting devaluation of attachment bonds (promiscuous sexual behavior and many marital relationships) were able to predict PCL-R total, factor and facet scores. Subsequently, we analyzed the transcripts of the 10 participants who obtained the highest PCL-R scores in the sample, assessing their childhood experiences and their current attachment representations and attachment styles. Results of the analyses showed that the PCL-R items denoting devaluation of attachment bonds were able to predict the PCL-R scores; moreover, most of the participants who obtained the highest PCL-R scores also reported severe abuse during their childhood and showed indicators of disorganized attachment.

"12074532","Acoustic communication in spring peepers","SummaryIn the previous study (Wilczynski et al. 1984) we found that neurons in the auditory nerve of female spring peepers (Hyla crucifer) are tuned to frequencies in the male advertisement call, whereas auditory units in male peepers are mismatched in spectral sensitivity to their call. We investigated, in the present report, behavioral consequences of this sexual dimorphism in auditory sensitivity. Call amplitude, rate of call attenuation with environmental transmission, and the amplitude of ambient noise were measured and used to compute the active space of this signal for males and females. The effect of calling height upon active space was considered. Measurements of active space were compared with intermale distances within breeding choruses.Results indicate that active space of the advertisement call for females is as much as 6 times greater than that for males, and varies directly with the height above ground from which males call. Observed maximum intermale distances correspond closely to the active space of the call for this sex. This suggests that males space themselves so that the amplitude of a neighbor's calls approximates their auditory neural threshold to call frequencies. By this proximal mechanism, peepers maximize intermale distance but ensure that they remain within a chorus.",2004,"Journal of Comparative Physiology A","10.1007/BF00610844",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12074532","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

Students enrolled in the matriculation colleges in Malaysia are the top notch students in the country. Environmental literacy of this group is perceived important because in future these students will be joining work force that requires important decision making. Environmental Literacy Model of these students is explained using environmental attitude, belief, conservation knowledge and Responsible Environmental Behavior (REB) with knowledge as a mediator. For this purpose data has been collected from 384 students (114 male and 270 female) and analyzed using covariance based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) approach. The result shows that REB is influenced by the students’ attitude and belief towards performing REB and knowledge about the environmental issues. On the other hand, students’ belief towards the environment does not influence the formation of REB. Furthermore students’ knowledge also does not mediate the influence of belief on the REB. These findings imply that individual who possess certain desirable attitude, belief and conservation knowledge have more tendencies to engage in REB.

In the first, I discuss in more detail his notions of transformation, paying particular attention to the ways in which we redefine ourselves to cope with different situations (as I did while visiting two specific museums in Vienna and Samos). The second will examine Bruner’s belief in the power of narrative or storytelling as ways to impose order on the uncertainties of life (as well as one’s expectations from it) that renders everyone authors of their own adaptations. In the final section I suggest that the capacity for “making stories” (Bruner’s term) assumes equal importance in psychological terms as it does for the screenwriter or adapter: all of us construct narratives through a process of individual distillation of experiences and information, and subsequently refine them through group interaction. Through this process we understand more about ourselves and our relationship to the world around us.

Additionally, country differences in cyberbullying on-the-go are explored. Analyses were carried out employing a random stratified sample of 25,142 children aged 9-16 from 25 European countries. A multilevel stepwise logistic regression with cyberbullying mode (online and mobile phone vs. online only) as the dependent variable showed that among online bully victims being cyberbullied on-the-go was less likely in Bulgaria and Denmark and more likely in Sweden when compared to the odds across all countries. Moreover, being cyberbullied on-the-go was associated with being older, female and using the internet on-the-go (step 1), higher sensation seeking, psychological difficulties and being more upset by the experience (step 2) as well as a higher likelihood of being bullied via social networking sites (SNS) and instant messages (IM) but not the range of cyberbullying types experienced (step 3). In this last step of the analysis being upset by the experience as well as psychological difficulties ceased to be related to the mode of cyberbullying suggesting that cyberbullying experiences on SNS and IM are potential mechanisms by which cyberbullying on-the-go is experienced as more distressing.",2013,"Journal of psychosocial research","10.5817/CP2013-1-4",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53592665","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

"147590125","Reflecting the Changing Face of American Society: How 1970’s Sitcoms and Spin-Offs Helped Redefine American Identity","When looking back at the popular American situation comedies of the 1970’s, one notices a vast network of programs aimed at framing social discourse and at helping America come to term with its own, changing image. This was done through a restaging of the political and social ills of the generation as comedic teleplays, thereby using laughter as a vehicle towards social awareness and unwitting change or personal growth, and by recycling popular (and unpopular) cliches and stereotypes (the bigot, the racist, the bleeding-heart liberal, the closed-minded conservative, the touchy feminist, etc.) so as to undermine them while appearing to reinforce them. As this paper will demonstrate, situations used in these situation comedies were often adaptations of lesser known British television programs (as is the case with Norman Lear’s long-running series All in the Family and Sanford and Son), or of landmark films and plays pointing to new social norms (as with Robert Gutchell’s Alice or James Komack’s The Courtship of Eddie’s Father). One also notes that these recycled and reworked premises were in turn recycled and reworked into numerous spin-offs, and even spin-offs of spin-offs, thereby weaving a thick network of popular television programming that attempted to depict every facet and variation of the changing face of American society and to help Americans accept that new face while unabashedly laughing at it. Thus, these television comedies reflected, framed and fed social discourse in the 1970’s. Racism, ‘reverse racism’, religious bigotry, anti-Semitism, draft-dodging, anti-government protest, women’s rights, divorce, and even rape — no topic was too controversial to be treated in the most direct and often vehement of manners in this hard-hitting new breed of sitcom. One could argue that American sitcoms have never been as politically incorrect or socially aware as they were some forty years ago, yet it is also undeniable that current programming owes a great deal to these ground-breaking sitcoms of the 1970’s. Thus, as a closing point, it is important to note how these programs have served as a palimpsest and a common set of references for today’s TV series, and to show how much contemporary ‘breakthrough television’ owes to the Archie Bunkers, Fred Sanfords and Mary Tyler Moores of the 1970’s.",2013,"TV/Series","10.4000/tvseries.735",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:147590125","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500
"147349217","On the Meaning and Use of Images of the Terrible","It is sometimes argued that images are stronger and have more impact when they depict terrible things so realistically that the viewer reacts to the scene as if it all happened before his eyes. Some people think that being shocked by an image is the best way to become aware of what happened and react politically or morally in an appropriate way. The photographic image, which – if Roland Barthes is right – is caused ‘chemically’ by what-has-been, and the television, have become the prime media to show horror ‘objectively’: the nature of these media itself is considered to guarantee the ‘truth’ of the image, whilst any figurative representation or description is seen as a construction that inevitably makes ‘meaning’ and can ipso facto not do justice to what happened and is ‘unimaginable’ and ‘unrepresentable’. This article starts from the idea that revulsion or being shocked by (an image of) horror is a bodily reaction that (also) implies a form of refusal, makes one insensitive, and does not in itself entail a proper awareness at all. It is argued, against Roland Barthes’ theory of the punctum, that images are not ‘natural’ but artificial things, and that ‘strong images’ are produced and composed to ‘hurt’ the mind and structure memoria.

"55910083","Evaluating Positive Social Competence in Preschool Populations.","Literature ReviewDeveloping social competence is seen as critical to an individual's overall adjustment (Chen, Zhang, Chen, & Li, 2012; Merrell, Streeter, Boelter, Caldarella, & Gentry, 2001). Social competence is influential in a person's feeling of success in several aspects of life including school, relationships, and social interactions. For example, Walker, Garber, and Greene (1994) found social competence to act as a buffer against health problems commonly associated with negative life events. Specifically, children who experienced negative life events and had low social competence demonstrated high levels of somatic complaints, whereas, for children who had high levels of social competence, negative experiences were not related to somatic complaints. One study even showed increased social competence resulting in decreased cardiovascular risk (Boyer & Nelson, 2015). Social competence can also influence school success (Chen et al., 2012; Wentzel, 1991) and self-esteem (Houck & Spegman, 1999; Mota & Matos, 2013), thus providing a strong foundation for positive long-term effects. For instance, one longitudinal study found children seen as socially competent at 16 months continued to be viewed as socially competent through 15 years of age (Campbell, Lamb, & Hwang, 2000).Conversely, low levels of social competence can contribute to lowered selfesteem (Egan & Perry, 1998), which in turn can contribute to victimization. Egan and Perry (1998) suggested that children who are isolated often end up anxious and submissive in conflicts with others and, therefore, become a main target for bullies. Healy, Sanders, and Iyer (2015) found bullied children had lesser relationships with their peers. Other risks related to deficits in social competence include conduct problems, substance abuse, poor school adjustment, violence, juvenile delinquency, and antisocial behavior (Merrell et al., 2001). Consequently, children with low levels of social competence may be atrisk for long-term negative consequences.Currently, several barriers hinder the application of truly comprehensive programs to support young children's social and emotional growth. Initially, one major concern was no consensus on the definition of social competence had been reached among researchers (Arsenio & Lemerise, 2001; McConnell & Odom, 1999). Therefore, although social competence is identified as the variable of interest in several studies, few have actually studied the same construct. While current research generally recognizes social competence as a more multifaceted construct (Gagnon et al., 2014), many times the operational inclusion is still minimized because only one measure is used in the assessment process. This results in often reducing the complexity of the construct to a set of social skills or a lack of problem behaviors. Researchers have warned that this minimized construct will not likely translate to social competence (Erdley & Asher, 1999; Pianta & Walsh, 1998). Therefore, investigations are needed that employ social competence as an entirely positive construct. Finally, research on social competence is often limited by methodological factors, such as incorporating only portions of the relevant variables into a study. This parceling does not allow for a more complex understanding of the interrelationship among all of the variables. Furthermore, interactions between the various variables could potentially have a great effect on the conclusions.The importance of children's emotional and social stability as a prerequisite for entering school has been emphasized frequently by researchers and teachers (Bierman et al., 2008; Blair, 2002; Chang, Shelleby, Cheong, & Shaw, 2012; Pianta & La Paro, 2003). Specifically, a survey completed by the National Center for Early Development and Learning (NCEDL) demonstrated teachers' concerns about how social deficits will impact learning in kindergarten classrooms (Rimm-Kaufman, Pianta, & Cox, 2000). …",2016,"School Community Journal",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55910083","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

Carolina E. Kupper-Tetzel (kuepper-tetzel@psychologie.uni-mannheim.de) Department of Psychology, Chair III, L13, 15, 68131 Mannheim, Germany Keywords: Concepts; representation Results & Discussion Method Fifty-one persons participated for monetary compensation or psychology course credits. Ten abstract nouns and their corresponding schematic drawings (image schemas) were obtained through norming studies. For half of these nouns, the spatial relation of sameness was shown to be crucial: agreement, analogy, arrangement, harmony, and standard. The other nouns were characterized by aspects of difference: advantage, diversity, exception, preference, and separation. Image schemas reflected the appropriate spatial relation. Each trial in the experiment consisted of a prime and a target phase. In the prime phase, image schemas were accompanied by sentences that either focused on the critical relation in the drawing (focus sentences) or distracted from this relation (nonfocus sentences). To make sure that participants process the image schemas, their task was to decide whether the drawing was described correctly or not. In the target phase, participants saw two abstract nouns that either matched the previous image schema with its spatial relation or not (matching vs. nonmatching condition). The two nouns were written in distinct fonts and participants were required to indicate as quickly as possible whether they are identical or not. Mean Reaction Time (ms) Many studies have demonstrated that a perception-based knowledge representation approach can account for the representation of concrete concepts (e.g., table). However, only a few studies have been carried out to test whether this approach can explain the representation of abstract concepts (e.g., prejudice) as well. Barsalou (1999) assumed three aspects that make the representation of abstract concepts within a perception-based knowledge representation framework possible: a) the situation as the background for understanding, b) selective attention, and c) introspective states and processes. Richardson, Spivey, Barsalou, and McRae (2003) showed that the representation of abstract concepts can be ascribed to spatial relations that were derived from perceptual experiences. In the present study it was hypothesized that a spatial relation (difference vs. sameness) is extracted during perception of abstract concepts and stored in long-term memory. A priming method was applied to test whether the perception of simple image schemas characterized by certain spatial relations facilitate the response to the corresponding abstract nouns. Response times were subjected to a 2 (focus vs. nonfocus sentences) x 2 (matching condition) repeated-measures ANOVA separately for each spatial relation. A significant interaction was revealed for abstract nouns on the difference relation, F(1,47)=4.293, p=.044 (see Figure 1). All other effects were not significant, Fs≤1.813, ps≥.185. Mean Response Time (ms) Introduction Nonmatching condition Matching condition focus nonfocus Figure 1: Mean response times for nouns on the spatial relation of difference Faster response times occurred in the matching condition than in the nonmatching condition when the image schema was described by a focus sentence, t(47)=-1.959, p=.028 (one-tailed). Response times were slower in the nonmatching condition when a focus sentence, compared to a nonfocus sentence, described the image schema, t(47)=2.011, p=.025 (one-tailed). No significant difference was detected in the matching condition between focus and nonfocus sentences, t(47)=-0.379, p=.706. It seems that for certain abstract concepts a rather schematic knowledge in the form of simple spatial relations exists that was extracted from the perception of many situations in which the abstract concept was the center of attention.

A socio-cognitive framework describes the development of children’s individual skills and how their abilities are supported by active participation in social and cultural experiences. Symbolic understanding is not an isolated cognitive skill, but rather a complex socio-cognitive developmental process that is intimately supported by meaningful interactions. A socio-cognitive framework may help teachers to support the symbolic understanding of school-aged children with deafblindness. Teachers of children with deafblindness can use the framework to understand their students’ individual socio-cognitive abilities and their social interactions.

Based on the individual family's needs and the availability of local resources, these families were supported by 2 trained and experienced mothers of children with special needs, the staff of the family-centered early intervention center as well as the self-help parent group, and a researcher. Notwithstanding the myriad of criteria considered when matching the families before the program implementation, the fitness of the match would ultimately be determined on the basis of the initial contact or subsequent interactions between families. During the program implementation, this study found the following: (1) “natural” and well-prepared initial contact facilitated subsequent relationships; (2) understanding real needs was the key; (3) “being present” was a form of support; and (4) experienced parents could help “translate” professionals' recommendations. After the program was implemented, experienced parents needed support, too. This study concludes that “localization” is the key in implementing parent-to-parent programs. Furthermore, with more people involved in the program, trained professionals will no longer exert a dominant influence and more members of the families' informal support network can be empowered.",2018,"Infants & Young Children","10.1097/IYC.0000000000000114",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:148586486","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500
"2417039","Health and Psycho-Social Problems of the Children with Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder: Comparative Analysis","Background and objectives. AD/HD is one of the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood, with an estimated prevalence 8-11%. Comorbidity is characteristic of this disorder. The authors of this paper are trying to compare manifestation of health and psycho-social problems of the children with AD/HD in groups (with and without bronchial asthma) with the general population. Material and methods. Health and psycho-social problems were evaluated in three groups of I-IV grade school-children: 1) Primary school children representing general population (N=178). 2) Primary school children with AD/HD, but not suffering from bronchial asthma (N=36). 3) Primary school children with AD/HD and suffering from bronchial asthma (N=36). Results. In the group of children with AD/HD and bronchial asthma headaches, stomachaches, allergy, sleep problems, inclination to depression were more frequent in comparison with the group of children with only AD/HD (p≤0,05). In the group of children with only AD/HD, unwilled urination problems, disorders and habits of psychological- neurological nature (such as tics, speech impediment, nail biting) are more frequent. Problems of social behavior are also more frequent within the group of children with AD/HD (p≤0,05). Conclusions. Primary school pupils representing general population face least health and psychosocial problems if compared with the children with AD/HD. Children suffering from AD/HD and bronchial asthma more often complain of somatic symptoms (headaches, stomachaches), allergy, sleep problems, inclination to depression, if compared with the children with only AD/HD. Nevertheless, in the group of children with AD/HD (without bronchial asthma) problems of enuresis, speech impediment and social behavior are more evident. doi:10.5200/sm-hs.2012.062",2012,NA,"10.5200/304",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2417039","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

Current researches in English language teaching methodologies have proved that teachers who stay up to date with latest teaching techniques are always efficient. They always need to be trained and aware of how they can continue being effective teachers and cope with relative challenges such as students’ low level of language proficiency, large number of students in class at a time and longer teaching hours. Hence the sole objective of the present research is to evaluate the effectiveness of Professional Development Program (PDP) of Taif University. Seeking for this objective, the researcher collected the data through a questionnaire from the participating teachers both males (50) and females (50). The survey was based on five principles drawn by Loucks-Horsley, et al. (2010). The respondents acknowledged the utility and importance of continuous up gradation of their professional development and leadership skills. They also acknowledged that PDP provides learning opportunity for them. Furthermore they regarded PDP in line with the TU-ELC mission, goal, and objectives.

Limited empirical research has examined the effectiveness of GN with other non-English–speaking students. Hence, the present study investigated the effects of a GN intervention program on the academic performance of five students with learning difficulties during history class in a high school setting in Cyprus. An experimental reversal ABAB design was utilized to assess students' quiz and note-taking performance. Condition A consisted of regular classroom instruction, whereby the teacher lectured on historical events and students took their own notes. Condition B consisted of students completing GN while the teacher presented the history topic with PowerPoint slides. Students' learning performance was measured by (a) the number of correct responses on timed quizzes the following day and (b) the completeness and accuracy of notes taken during history instruction. Results evidenced a strong functional relation between students' academic performance and the GN program for all students. Student quiz performance improved by 23.5% to 33.5% during intervention. Similar findings were noted for note-taking performance. Positive social validity outcomes from the teacher and students support the practicality of the program.

It is required on a global level, to adequately distribute the development of tourism resorts and destinations, as well as to deal with the dangers that can arise and are related to overcrowding which can cause unsustainable development of the most visited and most attractive tourism places. The aim of the paper is to present the importance of the contemporary changes in tourism which requires adaptation of all participants in the creation of the tourism offer in given destinations. The destinations start to be considered as complex wholes with an aim to ensure competitiveness on the tourism market. Sustainable tourism has become a separate category of selective tourism offer. Destinations become to be a set of joint tourism products and services, which implies the active participation of all stakeholders.

Although research has established that exonerees experience stigma and a general lack of reintegration support, little is known about underlying reasons that motivate such negative perceptions. This research examined whether the evidence and crime associated with a wrongful conviction could initiate a process that alters people’s perceptions of exonerees’ intelligence and mental health status, and, in turn, undermine people’s judgments of exonerees’ guilt and subsequent willingness to support reintegration services. Participants (N = 253) read a news story about an exoneree who was wrongfully convicted of either murder or grand theft auto resulting from either a false confession or eyewitness misidentification. Participants then offered their perceptions of the exoneree’s intelligence and mental health followed by guilt-confidence judgments. Last, participants indicated their willingness to support reintegration services (psychological counseling, career counseling, and job training). Results indicated that wrongful convictions stemming from a false confession caused people to perceive the exoneree as less intelligent and these judgments, in turn, were associated with perceptions that the exoneree suffered from mental health issues which, subsequently, influenced participants’ uncertainty of the exoneree’s innocence. The string of perceptions and judgments consequently undermined people’s willingness to support each of the reintegration services. The observed effects provide empirical evidence for reforms that automatically guarantee support services for exonerees in order to overcome potential biases aimed as those who have been wrongfully convicted.",2018,"Psychology, Public Policy, and Law","10.1037/law0000163",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149827858","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

"15665351","Somatization vs. Psychologization of Emotional Distress: A Paradigmatic Example for Cultural Psychopathology","This paper describes the developing area of cultural psychopathology, an interdisciplinary field of study focusing on the ways in which cultural factors contribute to the experience and expression of psychological distress. We begin by outlining two approaches, often competing, in order to provide a background to some of the issues that complicate the field. The main section of the paper is devoted to a discussion of depression in Chinese culture as an example of the types of questions that can be studied. Here, we start with a review of the epidemiological literature, suggesting low rates of depression in China, and move to the most commonly cited explanation, namely that Chinese individuals with depression present this distress in a physical way. Different explanations of this phenomenon, known as somatization, are explored and reconceptualized according to an increasingly important model for cross-cultural psychologists: the cultural constitution of the self. We close by discussing some of the contributions, both theoretical and methodological, that can be made by cross-cultural psychologists to researchers in cultural psychopathology.

It has attracted the interest of ancient as well as contemporary scholars investigating human lore (e.g. linguists, philosophers, scholars studying communication, culture or literature). The sparse studies on silence perceived silence as the antonym of all sounds (including speech: non-voluntary: stillness external to communication; symptoms such as muteness as breaks in communication; or silencing) or as background (voluntary paralinguistic pauses demarcating speech as figure).The current article is based on linguistic studies which, having differentiated between the above silences and verbal silence (VS) – unarticulated verbal signifiers chosen by the speaker to signify meaningful content alongside speech – incorporated VS in the linguistic inventory. ::: ::: This article focuses on the contributions to linguistics made by the integration of VS in the linguistic inventory. Insights are offered by the identification, understanding and refinement of linguistic concepts in light of the analyses of VS examples (the zero-sign, ellipsis as signifiers, asyndeton, etc.) drawn from literature, advertisements and spoken language. The major contribution is that the particularity of VSs, as unarticulated verbal signifiers, calls for the re-examination of key linguistic issues, such as figure and ground organizations, universalism, and linearity of the verbal code.",2016,"Poznan Studies in Contemporary Linguistics","10.1515/psicl-2016-0006",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:147464852","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

Investigating pupil-generated questions in a collaborative science learning setting, combining self-regulation theory and phases of inquiry, can extend the previous research into pupils’ questions. This study considered questions from pupils (n = 24, aged 11–12) as types of interaction to share and reflect on both their own and others’ ideas during a collaborative open inquiry. The study was qualitative in nature. The data was collected by making video recordings of pupils’ team discussions during the study process in 12 science lessons. A content analysis demonstrates that through their questions, the pupils were actively involved in guiding their work from various points of views. These results suggest that fifth graders can successfully conduct a complex open inquiry in teams. Consequently, this study underlines that allowing pupils to work at their own pace, and to take responsibility for their learning, opportunities can arise for pupils to pose questions and regulate their learning through questions.",2019,"Education Sciences","10.3390/educsci9020156",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197742329","Psychology",0.15,4103,0.04345385609285971,21356,500

The results demonstrated strong associations between different patterns of SPD and a wide range of symptomathology, including anxiety, somatization, distress, and demoralization, difficu- lties in social interactions, family, work and therapeutic relationships. The findings of this study indicate that extreme sensory processing patterns are strongly related to distress and psychological difficulties.

"145219005","Cosmopolitan Whiteness: The Effects and Affects of Skin-Whitening Advertisements in a Transnational Women's Magazine in Indonesia","Previous scholarship on the immense popularity of skin-whitening frames this practice as revealing women's desire to emulate whiteness and upper class white populations (Burke 1996; Peiss 1998; Hall 2005). Others have focused on whitening practices to highlight the working of racialized color hierarchy and European/Euro-American hegemony in local and global contexts (Hunter 2005; Pierre 2008; Glenn 2009;). This article breaks away from these established theoretical trajectories by arguing that desire for ""whiteness"" is not the same as desire for ""Caucasian whiteness."" Examining advertisements for skin-whitening products in the Indonesian version of Cosmopolitan and skin-tanning products in the American version of Cosmopolitan, I point out the construction of ""cosmopolitan whiteness.""

"150861654","The Making of a Foreign National Language: Language Politics and the Impasse between Assimilationists and Language Nationalists in Colonial Korea","Abstract:This article examines the process by which Japanese came to be solidified as the national language of instruction in public schools during the first decade of colonial rule (1911–22). First, I analyze Government-General of Korea language policy and the recollections in 1917 by the policy insider Oda Shogō, which reveal a confidence in the efficiency of administration but also a tension between the official discourse on Japanese language nationalization and the perceived proficiency of Korean instructors and students. The March First Movement less than two years later exploded the misconception of a complacent student body and brought to the fore simmering grievances, notably the language of instruction issue in public schools. Through an analysis of the language of instruction debate in the popular press, I demonstrate the rupture that had developed between Japanese officials and the Korean public, an unbridgeable divide due to the impasse between co-educationalists calling for integrated education in Japanese only and ""language nationalists"" demanding more instruction in Korean. The Second Rescript on Education proclaimed by the Government-General in 1922 thus affirmed the dominant position of Japanese in the curriculum and ensured the continuing vitality of private sŏdang well into the 1920s.",2019,"Journal of Korean Studies","10.1215/21581665-7258055",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150861654","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500

Based on interviews and online material, the article examines how the two rights are spoken of, how threats are perceived, and how the companies define their role in terms of protecting those rights. The article finds that both companies frame themselves as strongly committed to (and actively promoting) human rights. The framing, however, focuses primarily on potential human rights violations by governments, and pays less attention to areas where the companies’ own business practices may have a negative impact on their users’ rights and freedoms.

"148295452","ACADEMICIAN BOŽIDAR ĆURČIĆ, IN APPRECIATION","This book is dedicated to the memory of Academician Božidar Curĉic, the founder of arachnology in Serbia. It seldomly happens that someone’s name is so closely associated with a scientific discipline as in the case of Prof. Dr. Božidar Curĉic. His contribution to the development of biospeleology in Serbia is immeasurable. More than four decades of his devoted study on both epigean and cave-dwelling pseudoscorpions and other arthropods resulted in better understanding of the diversity of the invertebrate groups in Serbia, the former Yugoslavia and many other countries. In this special issue are presented scientific papers from different fields of zoology written by eminent scientists from Serbia and numerous countries worldwide. They represent a token of appreciation of the fruitful and long-lasting scientific career of Academician Božidar Curĉic, whose scientific opus covered several zoological disciplines such as arachnology, developmental biology, evolutionary biology and biospeleology. Besides being a scientist of broad interests, Prof. Dr. Božidar Curĉic possessed an admirable virtue – the readiness to help his colleagues and collaborators whenever his help or advice was needed. His willingness to help his younger colleagues and associates and unselfishly share his broad knowledge with them made him not only a great scientist, but a great man as well. The vast scientific opus of Prof. Dr. Božidar Curĉic will be highly appreciated by his colleagues in the years to come, as an example of devoted, long-lasting scientific work and will, without any doubt, serve as a guideline to his younger colleagues. Those who had luck and privilege to work with Prof. Dr. Božidar Curĉic will remember him as a fastidious scientist, a multifaceted person of diverse interests and, above all, a trustful friend.",2016,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:148295452","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"56049434","A Union of Formalism and Flexibility: Allowing Employers to Set Their Own Liability under Federal Employment Discrimination Laws","INTRODUCTION Several federal employment discrimination statutes allocate protection depending on whether potential plaintiffs occupy positions of control within a business entity. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, (1) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), (2) and the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act (ERISA) (3) all permit suits by ""employees"" against their current or former employers, but do not provide any avenue of relief for those classified as ""employers."" (4) For instance, the ADEA provides: ""It shall be unlawful for any employer ... to limit, segregate, or classify his employees ... because of such individual's age...."" (5) Predictably, courts have not always agreed as to what differentiates an employee from an employer. Particularly with regard to innovative business forms that have risen to prominence in recent decades, the distinction between the two is confounded. (6) Statutory language defines an employee as ""any individual employed by an employer."" (7) A strict statutory construction, therefore, would categorically deny relief to some members of business entities organized as partnerships, yet universally afford protection to similarly situated members of incorporated entities. (8) Traditionally, a partner could not stand in an employment relationship with his or her partnership because partners personally control the ownership interests, making them employers rather than employees. Because a partnership is the partners, it cannot also employ the partners. Stated from another angle, a partnership simply cannot employ itself. If partners cannot employ themselves, it follows that partners cannot be employees in the technical sense of the term. On the contrary, all partners are, by default, employers. As a result, partners are ineligible to seek protection from employment discrimination because employers are not members of a protected category. Compare partnerships to incorporated entities. Unlike a partnership, a corporation is an independent legal persona existing only on paper. It exists wholly apart from even its most high-ranking officers, operates as the de facto employer, and exists in perpetuity. (9) The title of ""employer"" resides with either the legal persona or, ultimately, with the shareholders. (10) Thus, no person who works for the corporation will be subject to the employer exemption, and courts will not dismiss plaintiffs' suits for lack of statutory standing. (11) Only the corporate persona itself falls into the employer exemption. (12) A strict statutory construction, therefore, only affords protection to members of incorporated entities. Several courts have utilized this all-or-nothing approach and declined to look past a business entity's organizational form in determining worker eligibility to sue under Title VII, the ADEA, or ERISA. (13) This approach has been dubbed the ""per se rule. ""(14) As one would predict, courts invoking the per se rule always exempt partners of firms from protection. This is referred to as the ""partnership exemption."" (15) A brief history of holdings implicating the per se rule and justifications for its use is offered in Part I of this Note. More recent decisions reflect an emerging trend, which is to consider a plaintiff's ability to protect his or her own interests within a business entity in order to determine eligibility for protection under ERISA, the ADEA, or Title VII. Courts have focused on an extensive, though not exhaustive, list of factors (16) that tend to indicate ""whether the employer's control of employment opportunities places the worker in a position of dependency on the employer which may expose the worker to discriminatory conduct."" (17) Courts that use this test ask whether a position of dependency within a business entity negates the presumption that a partner cannot be a victim of employment discrimination. This in-depth inquiry, spurning deference to an individual's title and focusing instead on actual powers, is referred to as the ""economic realities test. …",2003,"William and Mary law review",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56049434","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500

The author argues that the ICJ's contribution to IEL can be organized in two main waves of cases. The legacy of the first wave, which covered essentially the Corfu Channel and the Nuclear Tests cases, as well as an important obiter dictum made in the Barcelona Traction case, was the confirmation of previous case-law on transboundary damages as well as the introduction of the concept of obligations erga omnes, potentially applicable to some environmental norms. The second wave, constituted mainly by the Nauru and the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros cases, the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, and a number of separate/dissenting opinions, was important in consolidating the previous achievements and pointing to a number of interconnections between IEL and other sub-fields of international law such as boundary delimitation and international humanitarian law. In this context, the Pulp Mills and Aerial Herbicides cases, currently pending before the ICJ, could potentially pave the way for a third wave, providing much needed clarifications of issues such as the specific contents of IEL as well as the hierarchy and enforceability of its principles.",2008,"Fordham International Law Journal",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53369815","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500

In my text I propose a non-traditional approach to the issue of protection of legitimate expectations in administrative law. Instead of analysing the problem from the perspective of the relationship between the administrative body and the individual, I have attempted to tackle the problem from the perspective of entities involved in peer relationships. The subject of my analysis is the principle of good faith as the axiological foundation for the protection of legitimate expectations in administrative law. Next the article addresses the specific legal institutions that express the protection of legitimate expectations in horizontal perspective: prohibition to make assertions contradictory to prior position (estoppel), institutions that express the protection of legitimate expectations in administrative contracts, as well as the principle of good faith in relationship between administrative bodies. The principle of good faith is a universal legal construct that forms the foundation of the legal system.

Drawing on primary source materials, the article argues that these Friends were able to agitate for radical legislative and social change using virtue ethics as their framework. The paper further suggests that the moral parameters of the Quaker testimony for peace expanded briefly in this period to include interspecies as well as intraspecies engagement. Friends accomplished this by arguing that humans could not engage in vivisection—a “moral disease” just like slavery and war—without risking individual and social virtue. Friends were able to call for radical change in society without arguing for ethical egalitarianism.

Indeed, it has been argued that theatre activity during these years constitutes a “movement” largely because of Kareda’s engaging writing at the time, which popularly labeled it as “movement” even as it emerged. However, Kareda’s equally engaging writing in the campus weekly newspaper the Varsity in the mid-1960s, while he was a student at the University of Toronto, has been left unexplored. This essay argues that Kareda’s themes, styles, and opinions in that student publication reveal much about the development of his early views on theatre practices and aesthetics in the years prior to the emergence of the alternative theatres, most notably his unwavering preference for neo-Aristotelian stage naturalism and psychological realism, and a dynamic emphasis on Toronto’s theatre ecology.

They may conform to the requirements of some moral code or code of honor. Doing any one of these things may entail considerable self-sacrifice. We need not insist on a view as to how widespread this behavior is in order to acknowledge that such behavior counts for a considerable portion of both routine and deliberate behavior.

"49484030","Is it distinctively wrong to simulate doing wrong?","This paper is concerned with whether there is a moral difference between simulating wrongdoing and consuming non-simulatory representations of wrongdoing. I argue that simulating wrongdoing is (as such) a pro tanto wrong whose wrongness does not tarnish other cases of consuming representations of wrongdoing. While simulating wrongdoing (as such) constitutes a disrespectful act, consuming representations of wrongdoing (as such) does not. I aim to motivate this view in part by bringing a number of intuitive moral judgements into reflective equilibrium, and in part by describing the case of a character that I call The Devious Super Geek who simulates wrong to particular people that he knows personally. I build bridging cases from the case of the Devious Super Geek to capture games in which one simulates wrong to imaginary members of extant, morally salient categories. The surprising conclusions that we are led to include not just that simulated wrongdoing is pro tanto wrong, but that simulated Just killing is pro tanto wrong, and also that the simulated killing of zombies and aliens is also pro tanto wrong. Finally, I describe how I propose to handle some potential objections and attempt to weigh the pro tanto wrong identified in the paper against some countervailing considerations in some all things considered judgements.",2018,"Ethics and Information Technology","10.1007/s10676-018-9463-7",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49484030","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"27213139","WHAT HAS RACE/ETHNICITY GOT TO DO WITH EFL TEACHING?","This article examines the way that some EFL (English as a foreign language) teachers in Green City (South of Brazil) understand and address the issue of cultural plurality as a cross-curricular theme (CPCCT) and issues of race/ ethnicity. The reason that CPCCT is such an important issue in Brazil is that it is a diverse society with a tradition of upholding the myth of racial democracy. The main argument in this article is that, unless teachers have an adequate understanding of issues of race/ethnicity, issues of CPCCT will be addressed inadequately in schools. This article is based on a qualitative research I carried out in the south of Brazil. According to my findings, teachers’ own orientations to CPCCT might be associated with the celebration of diversity in Brazil, rather than challenging to deconstruct racism that exists in Brazilian society. Key-words: race/ethnicity; EFL teaching; cultural plurality; critical race theory. It is very tempting to appropriate CRT (Critical Race Theory) as a more powerful explanatory narrative for the persistent problems of race, racism and social injustice. If we are serious about solving these problems in schools and classrooms, we have to be serious about intense study and careful rethinking of race and education. Adopting and adapting CRT as a framework for educational equity means that we will have to expose racism in education and propose radical solutions for addressing it. (Ladson-Billings, 1998, p.22; her emphasis) The major point of CRT is to place race at the center of analysis.

"143591952","The semiotics of undesirable bodies: Transnationalism, race culture, abjection","Abstract Contemporary transnational migration has given rise to a new ideology and semiotics of the foreign body – one that draws on the cognitive field of the primitive, marked, and abjected body. This foreign body is carefully differentiated from both the sphere of the local/national, and the “expatriate” professional who by virtue of economic and cultural capital is desired and assimilated into the local sphere. An aspiring cosmopolitan and global city-state like Singapore shows this semiotic differentiation to quite a marked degree, in the policies and discourses of barely-tolerated and abjected foreign workers whose racially-marked bodies are highlighted by typologies of violence, disease, sexuality (particularly in aberrant or promiscuous form), and mob assemblies. The semiotics of the foreign body in Singapore is also evident in other racial-cultural fissures elsewhere, including in countries with multicultural reputations such as Australia, and countries like the U.S., U.K. and France that are struggling to cope with large migrant communities of Middle-Eastern and South Asian peoples.",2014,"Semiotica","10.1515/sem-2014-0002",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:143591952","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500

The attitude scale was processed through validity and reliability tests in order to ensure the highest possible efficiency. The inadequate literature on health tourism education and the lack of an attitude scale related to the issue give the impression that the education factor in health tourism is so far ignored. In this respect, the Attitude Scale for Health Tourism Education, can be used to identify the attitudes of stakeholders taking part in the health tourism sector in North Cyprus and other relevant issues. The scale was also designed to be used in studies that could lay the groundwork for a training model which can be developed for the health tourism sector in North Cyprus. It is also believed that this work will contribute to the application of original scientific studies in areas such as the health tourism, psychology, sociology, business administration and engineering which will necessarily be engaged in developing a program for health tourism education with an interdisciplinary approach.",2017,"Procedia Computer Science","10.1016/j.procs.2017.11.229",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:148906043","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"3447848","Towards cultural materialism in the medical humanities: the case of blood rejuvenation","This paper argues for an approach within the medical humanities that draws on the theoretical legacy of cultural materialism as a framework for reading cultural practices and their relationship to the social and economic order. It revisits the origins and development of cultural materialism in cultural studies and literary studies between the 1970s and 1990s and considers how, with adaptation, this methodology might facilitate ideological criticism focused on material formations of health, disease and the human body. I outline three key characteristics of a medicocultural materialist approach along these lines: (a) interdisciplinary work on a broad range of medical and cultural sources, including those drawn from ‘popular’ forms of culture; (b) the combination of historicist analysis with scrutiny of present-day contexts; (c) analyses that engage with political economy perspectives and/or the work of medical sociology in this area. The subsequent sections of the paper employ a medicocultural materialist approach to examine conjectural understandings of, and empirical investigations into, the capacity of transfused human blood to rejuvenate the ageing body. I trace textual faultlines that expose the structures of power which inform the movement of blood between bodies in ‘medical gothic’ fictions from the 19th-century fin de siecle, including Mary Elizabeth Braddon9s ‘Good Lady Ducayne’ (1896) and Bram Stoker9s Dracula (1897). I conclude with a critique of biomedical innovations in blood rejuvenation in the era of medical neoliberalism, before considering the potential applications of medicocultural materialism to other topics within the field of the medical humanities.",2018,"Medical Humanities","10.1136/medhum-2017-011209",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3447848","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"149329857","The Question of British Southern Cameroons’ Autonomy in the Evolution of Nigeria Federation, 1945-1961","The connection of Southern Cameroons to the Nigerian Federation by Britain after the First World War, worked to the disadvantage of Southern Cameroons’ sovereignty and political ambitions. With her international status as a Trust Territory, Southern Cameroons was marginalized by the colonial administration which failed to recognize her as a separate territory within the Nigerian Federation. Under such dispensation, Southern Cameroonians felt that for such a Nigerian connection to be of any benefit to the territory, it should be granted an autonomous regional status in line with the existing regions in Nigeria. This strain of relations caused Cameroonians to animate Nigeria political scene with series of events which became very instrumental in influencing the direction and nature of the evolution of the Nigerian federation. This feud for regional autonomy which dominated Nigerian politics was undertaken by pressures groups, political parties, and at individual levels through vocal voices, petitions, conferences and walkouts which expressed their grievances. The paper argues that the granting of quasi and full regional status in 1954 and 1959 respectively to Southern Cameroons was a consequence of their demonstrations. On this score Nigeria rose from three to four regions under colonial rule. From this paradigm we conclude that the history of the evolution of Nigerian federation can never be complete without the Southern Cameroons factor.

Within weeks, Japan’s new national security tripod was firmly in place: the top-level, political NSC ‘control tower’ as well as Japan’s first-ever National Security Strategy and National Security Secretariat. Ever since, the NSC has played a central role in every major aspect of the Japanese strategic trajectory that has attracted so much global attention (and controversy) in the ‘Abe era’. This study analyzes the motivations driving Japan’s decision to establish an NSC, the institution’s key characteristics and functioning, and offers a preliminary assessment of the current and likely future implications of this historic institutional reform.

This comes through especially in her writing on religion.

In this study, we propose “end states” as a theoretical and methodological vehicle to examine how narratives of civic crowdfunding projects stimulate crowd participation and how this participation shapes the broader institutional and organizational context. We analyze narrative end states in two civic crowdfunding projects taking place in the Netherlands. The results of our analysis show three types of narrative end states: plotted, revised, and future. Initial end states were plotted to fulfill a specific need of the project initiators, however, these proved unsuccessful in mobilizing the crowd. Through an intense revision of end states, project initiators learned how to connect the crowd-community to the project, ultimately inspiring new end states for greater crowd-community participation in the future.

"67768044","Viewpoint Neglected Interiors: A Critique of Political Ecology, with Reference to the Work of Ken Wilber","Both Political Ecology and Environmental Education correctly assert the importance of ideology critique and the reappropriation of knowledge/knowledge production in working for socio-ecological change (see Hattingh, et al., 2002:3–4; Lotz-Sisitka, 2002:117). Similarly, both disciplines confront the need to rethink our understanding of how social change comes about, and the limitations of current reflexive practises in enabling such change (Lotz-Sisitka, 2002:117). This viewpoint paper flags the importance – and partiality – of the post-structural sciences of complexity, political activism and discourse analysis in Political Ecology, and demonstrates both an irreducible interiority to our ecological problems, as well as how this interior domain may be approached and argued for.

"145807188","Sound of Africa!","Louise Meintjes. 2003. Sound of Africa!: Mediating Difference in a South Africa Music Studio. Durham and London: Duke University Press. Aficionados of ""world music,"" like those of jazz, who enjoy reading about their passion are in a far more fortunate situation than devotees of some other musical genres. The number of book-length treatments with an appeal beyond academic ethnomusicology is not overly large, but the best among them, like Tim Taylor's Global Pop (1997), are as enjoyable to read as the music they dilate upon so lovingly is to listen to. Further, world music scholars have shown an incisive sophistication in relating issues of performance to both local and global processes of cultural production and identity politics. Louise Meintjes' new volume from Duke University Press, Sound of Africa!, displays these qualities as well as stylistic and theoretical originality in considerable measure. Still, this is not a book like others in this field (or any other), and its idiosyncrasies will both intrigue and frustrate readers persistent enough to get themselves all the way through it. This difficulty in a book of only 265 pages (endnotes, glossary, and bibliography excluded), that is anything but a reference work is an indication of some of the challenges presented by the style and structure of the volume. Sound of Africa! documents not only the studio production of a particular genre of South African Zulu popular music but also a particular moment in time: the unstable period of negotiation preceding political transition from minority white rule in South Africa in 1991-1992. While the ""end of apartheid"" is popularly linked to the first democratic non-racial elections in 1994, those who were in the country will recall vividly the day in July 1991 when all racially based legislation and regulations were repealed. The reason the author chose that historical moment for the documentation of African music making in a Johannesburg recording studio was not its epochal transitional character, however, but the fortuitous timing of her research for a doctoral thesis in anthropology and music at the University of Texas, completed in 1997, of which this book is the published re-write. The work suffers nothing from this distance from the research moment, and it stands today on its considerable merits as a reflection on a meaning-making musical process in a city and society at a unique political juncture. It is worthwhile, however, to compare the text of the original dissertation to that of the published version. While clearly a lot of reflection and hard work went into the revision, they are not either in form or spirit all that different. Indeed, the book's Acknowledgements express at the outset the author's debt to the teachers and advisors who assisted in the preparation of the thesis. As an African colleague once observed pointedly, if you haven't time to read a scholarly book, you can get the essentials from the Acknowledgements. The author's debt is not only to the inspiration drawn from her mentors' own ideas and craft, but also to their approval of such an unorthodox narrative as an academic thesis in the first place. I am sympathetic to Meintjes' desire to escape the conventions of academic genres, and the painfully visible effort it required to break down the formal academic constraints on performative writing about performance. As premise for this attempt the author can point, although she does not, to the lengthy history of debate over just how to describe and analyse musical sound and process in a purely verbal/visual medium, transcriptions notwithstanding. But even with this challenge accepted, the narrative style and structure is unusual even for a ride through a popular musical landscape. Like the book, the thesis strings together in-your-face evocations of personal experiences, encounters, and observations during fieldwork with thickly written meditations on critical theory not peculiarly applicable to the South African subject matter, with analyses of studio production processes and technology that will keep even the musical scholars among us flipping incessantly through the (thankfully provided) glossary. …",2003,"Anthropological Quarterly","10.1353/anq.2003.0005",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:145807188","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"25942573","Conceptualising the ‘community’ as a recipient of money – A critical literature review, and implications for health and inequalities","There is increasing attention on how money may bring about positive changes to health, and money-based development approaches are becoming more commonplace at the ‘community’ level, including in high-income countries. However, little attention has been paid to how the ‘community’ might be varyingly conceptualised in these scenarios, or to the potential implications of this for interpreting the impacts of such health improvement approaches. This paper presents a critical interpretive review of literature presenting different scenarios from high-income countries in which the ‘community’ receives money, to explore how ‘community’ is conceptualised in relation to this process. Some texts gave explicit definitions of ‘community’, but multiple other conceptualisations were interpreted across all texts, conveyed through the construction of ‘problematics’, and descriptions of how and why money was given. The findings indicate that the flow of money shapes how conceptualisations of ‘community’ are produced, and that the implicit power relations and inequalities can construct and privilege particular sets of identities and relationships throughout the process. This highlights implications for approaching public health evaluations of giving money to ‘communities’, and for better understanding how it might bring about change to health and inequalities, where the ‘community’ cannot be interpreted merely as a setting or recipient of such an intervention, but something constructed and negotiated through the flow of money itself.",2015,"Social science & medicine","10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.049",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25942573","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500

Yet the Indian Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Bill has been pending for five years, and the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research are somewhat vague and contradictory, resulting in self-regulated practices of fertility clinics. This paper broadly looks at clinical ethics in reproduction in the practice of surrogacy and decision-making in various procedures. Through empirical research in New Delhi, the capital of India, from December 2011 to November 2012, issues of decision-making on embryo transfer, fetal reduction, and mode of delivery were identified. Interviews were carried out with doctors in eighteen ART clinics, agents from four agencies, and fourteen surrogates. In aiming to fulfil the commissioning parents’ demands, doctors were willing to go to the greatest extent possible in their medical practice. Autonomy and decision-making regarding choice of the number of embryos to transfer and the mode of delivery lay neither with commissioning parents nor surrogate mothers but mostly with doctors. In order to ensure higher success rates, surrogates faced the risk of multiple pregnancy and fetal reduction with little information regarding the risks involved. In the globalized market of commercial surrogacy in India, and with clinics compromising on ethics, there is an urgent need for formulation of regulative law for the clinical practice and maintenance of principles of reproductive ethics in order to ensure that the interests of surrogate mothers are safeguarded.",2015,"Journal of Bioethical Inquiry","10.1007/s11673-015-9642-8",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23869979","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500

"150515354","Kenyan Curriculum Reforms and Mother Tongue Education: Issues, Challenges and Implementation Strategies","The implementation of mother tongue education (MTE) remains a challenge across Africa and Kenya in particular. This continues despite the fact that the maintenance and development of language and literacy skills in oneâ€™s mother tongue (MT) plays a critical role in facilitating second language (L2) learning, developing additive bilingualism and continuous cognitive development. Consequently, Kenya has had several education commissions in both colonial and post-colonial periods, which, together with the Constitution of Kenya have had a bearing on the language policy. However, the language policy has not been supported by a careful implementation strategy for MTE. Presently, Kenya is undergoing curriculum reforms from the ongoing 8-4-4 system, where learners study for eight years of basic (primary) education, four years of secondary education and four years of university education to a new system of 2-6-3-3-3. The 2-6-3-3-3 system comprises two years of pre-primary, six years of primary (three years lower and three years upper primary), six years of secondary (three years junior and three years senior) and three years of university education. While English has been given preponderant attention in the new curriculum, the role of MT has also been re-emphasised because it has not received as much attention as it deserves in the past. It is against this background and the ongoing debates on MTE that this paper attempts to examine the challenges that are likely to impede the implementation of MTE in the 2-6-3-3-3 curriculum reforms as outlined in the education policy. The paper further suggests some implementation strategies to avert the challenges. The study was conducted in Bungoma County in Kenya. Purposive sampling was used to identify key respondents from 10 schools which were used to pilot the new curriculum. The respondents included Grade 3 teachers, head teachers and quality assurance officers (QASOs). Focus group discussions (FGDs), unstructured interviews and document analysis were used to elicit data. The findings revealed that the implementation of MTE policy is likely to flop if it is not supported by careful implementation strategies that take care of teacher training, the production of teaching/learning materials and attempts to change the attitudes of parents towards indigenous languages. The paper advocates for implementation strategies such as greater resource allocation, teacher training on L1 methodologies, a change in attitude with regard to MTE, political will and clearer policy objectives to achieve the aims of an effective MTE system in Kenya.",2019,"Education As Change","10.25159/1947-9417/3379",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150515354","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"143525233","Broken Land: The Dust Bowl as Moral Failing","ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORIANS TEND TO SKIP the 1930s when compiling the narrative of the environmental movement in America. When the Progressive era died, the environment apparently fell off the radar screens of American social reformers. Not until Rachel Carson's startling Silent Spring, dramatically reinforced by a NASA photograph of Earth as a tiny and finite blue marble in a sea of emptiness, did environmentalism become important to either political leaders or the public. Notwithstanding these important landmarks in the history of environmental consciousness, the ideas that underlay the 1960s environmental movement can be traced directly to an older generation, the cultural leftists of the 1930s. The salient differences between old and new in motivations for protection of the earth can be said to gather around an understanding of humankind's relationship to the land. Does one preserve and control the land so it can better serve society-is conquest the right metaphor for the relationship-or does preserving nature have an intrinsic worth separate from the lives and needs of present human society-is caretaker the correct metaphor? Although most environmental historians would place in time the shift in attitude toward the land from the former to the latter after World War II, I posit that the caretaker",2003,"American Quarterly","10.1353/aq.2003.0047",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:143525233","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"144067325","Mentoring and individual learning plans: issues of practice in a period of transition","This article draws upon research undertaken with 28 teacher education mentors, managers and trainee teachers within the SW Centre for Excellence in Teacher Training (CETT) in 2008, following the introduction of the new revised Lifelong Learning UK (LLUK) standards. The first part of the article locates and contextualises the policy context in relation to the school and further education (FE) sectors. Two separate and distinctive models of mentoring practice are delineated, the first model as a source of formative support for trainee teachers, and the second model as a tool for the assessment of competence. The article concludes by suggesting that the danger and indeed unintended consequence of separating out these functions of mentoring is that an unnecessary dichotomy is created that dislocates coherent teacher practices from one another. It argues that what is needed is a sustained period of stability in the sector. This would leave a space for CETT professionals and others to promote those practices th...",2011,"Research in Post-compulsory Education","10.1080/13596748.2011.602249",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144067325","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"142944436","From Handbills to Proposed Bills: Suggestions for Regulating the Law Vegas ""Strip"" Tease","I. INTRODUCTIONThe world-class resorts that shape Las Vegas' neon skyline draw millions of visitors each year. These tourists are the lifeblood of the economy, and they come to enjoy the attractions and densely concentrated along Las Vegas Boulevard. resort district, known as the Strip, offers visiting pedestrians architectural views, inexpensive meals, live sidewalk shows, access to numerous hotel-casinos. However, while these attractions have been proven to effectively generate profits for resort owners, another force now aggressively competes for the time and attention of would-be resort patrons.Visitors walking along the Strip are constantly bombarded with adult- themed handbills distributed by off-premises canvassers.1 The majority of this material depicts graphic advertisements for referral services that provide erotic dancers directly to visitors' hotel rooms.2Because of its dense concentration of relatively new resorts, the Strip is often inundated with pedestrians using inadequately sized sidewalks to travel between attractions.3 This congestion has created what county commissioners have termed a ""captive audience"" for opportunistic adult outcall businesses, which use canvassers to obstruct high-traffic areas, effectively forcing their handbills on visitors.4 To make matters worse, the frequency of pedestrian delay has increased significantly during recent years as a result of fierce competition between outcall services. Because each service aims to outsell its competitors, each has the incentive to have the largest canvassing presence in the most congested locations.5 This ""competitive cycle"" has resulted in a glut of handbillers lining both sides of the Strip's bottlenecked sidewalks, creating gauntlets of graphic advertising ""through which pedestrians must pass and in which the pedestrians are forced to take the proffered advertising.""6 Occasionally, pedestrians wishing to avoid the graphic material are forced into the dangerous street as they attempt to bypass the cordons of canvassers.7This competitive and congested atmosphere has resulted in tourist harassment, physical disputes among canvassers, and extreme amounts of sexually charged litter.8 These conditions directly affect resort patronage, particularly at the resorts abutting premium canvassing locations.9 As a result, between 1994 and 1996, numerous resorts and other businesses brought civil actions to enjoin canvassers from engaging in such obstructive and abusive practices. This led to the issuance of over twenty court orders concerning pedestrian abuse.10Recognizing the need to regulate aggressive canvassing tactics, Clark County has repeatedly attempted to enact a legislative solution. In 1994, county commissioners enacted the Obstructive Use Ordinance in an effort to alleviate sidewalk congestion by criminalizing pedestrian obstruction.11 Unlike later restrictions, this ordinance did not implicate canvassers' expressive rights, but instead prohibited them from ""stacking and storing their distribution materials on sidewalks.""12 However, as is evident from the litany of injunctions issued after its passage,13 the Obstructive Use Ordinance failed to prevent pedestrian obstruction.In 1996, the county made a second legislative attempt to resolve its persistent concerns for pedestrian safety. It patterned the new ordinance after a law previously enacted in Key West, Florida, a tourist community with similar canvassing problems. On its face, the Key West ordinance completely banned all off-premises canvassing in the city's tourist district,14 and, like the Clark County ordinance, it was enacted only after less restrictive efforts had failed. The Key West model was attractive to Clark County's commissioners because it was both demonstrably effective and had survived a First Amendment challenge at the Eleventh Circuit.15Clark County's version of the ordinance, known as Section 16.12, took effect on January 1, 1997, and made it a misdemeanor to engage in ""off-premises canvassing"" within the Las Vegas Resort District. …",2012,"BYU Law Review",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:142944436","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500

They facilitate different modes of communication and social interactions, enabling individuals to play social roles that they regularly undertake in real social settings. In spite of the heterogeneity of the users and interactions, these networks exhibit common properties. For instance, individuals tend to associate with others who share similar interests, a tendency often known as homophily, leading to the formation of communities. This entry aims to provide an overview of the definitions for an online community and review different community detection methods in social networks. Finding communities are beneficial since they provide summarization of network structure, highlighting the main properties of the network. Moreover, it has applications in sociology, biology, marketing and computer science which help scientists identify and extract actionable insight.",2017,"Encycl. Semantic Comput.

The author suggests that a minimal approach to conducting a library program evaluation is to prove that the program exists. But this perspective has expanded to include different degrees of interest in the client and operations, culminating in a combined focus that leads evaluators to conduct outcome assessments. The chapter includes speculation on what motivates managers to undertake an evaluation, a review of some ways that library evaluations are conducted, and a discussion of several examples of program evaluations. Though there are no single directives for undertaking a library program evaluation, there are a variety of tools and advice to entice librarians to do more of them as a way to improve understanding the value of a library to its clientele and in society.",2004,"Archival Science","10.1007/s10502-005-6989-3",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144304715","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
"22445518","Performing the nation between us: urban photographic sets with young migrants","First developed during the 1990s, the transnational paradigm in the study of migration has been associated with the notions of displacement, deterritorialisation and frictionless-ness. In more recent times, there has been a growing tendency to spatially ground transnational studies by locating and emplacing transnational practices. The emergence of the so-called transnational urbanism has led to a prolific urban stream within transnational research. With respect to the growing diversity of Western societies, this literature has tended to emphasise the potentialities of the city as the location of lived diversity, sharing, dynamism, vibrancy and encounter, in contrast to the deficiencies of the nation , identified with formal politics, discourse and ideology, singular belonging, fixity and constraint. Against this narrative of the city/nation divide, this article draws attention to the alternative conceptualisations of the nation that have emerged in recent debates and have embraced local, material and agency-based, rather than discursively-oriented approaches to the nation. As well as the city/nation divide, a progressive idea of the nation as shared experiences is analysed within an urban performance project which involved young migrants in the city of Padua (Italy) during winter 2013. These performances are read from the particular perspective of the scale debate, suggesting that, through the performance of urban heritage sites, those migrants physically and emotionally locate themselves within the hosting nation . Finally, I discuss this scalar shift and I propose extrapolating the concept of the “urban unconscious” to the national level, thus suggesting a way to think about the nation as a frame of co-existence and not as an identity bond.",2015,"Fennia: International Journal of Geography","10.11143/45271",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22445518","Sociology",0.1,3186,0.033742136366524754,21356,500
