"18361266","Decreased Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I and Its Receptor Expression in the Hippocampus and Somatosensory Cortex of the Aged Mouse","Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a multifunctional polypeptide and has diverse effects on brain functions. In the present study, we compared IGF-I and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) immunoreactivity and their protein levels between the adult (postnatal month 6) and aged (postnatal month 24) mouse hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. In the adult hippocampus, IGF-I immunoreactivity was easily observed in the pyramidal cells of the stratum pyramidale in the hippocampus proper and in the granule cells of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. In the adult somatosensory cortex, IGF-I immunoreactivity was easily found in the pyramidal cells of layer V. In the aged groups, IGF-I expression was dramatically decreased in the cells. Like the change of IGF-I immunoreactivity, IGF-IR immunoreactivity in the pyramidal and granule cells of the hippocampus and in the pyramidal cells of the somatosensory cortex was also markedly decreased in the aged group. In addition, both IGF-I and IGF-IR protein levels were significantly decreased in the aged hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. These results indicate that the apparent decrease of IGF-I and IGF-IR expression in the aged mouse hippocampus and somatosensory cortex may be related to age-related changes in the aged brain.",2014,"Neurochemical Research","10.1007/s11064-014-1269-3",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18361266",21356

The economics of conventions is used as an analytical framework through which to demonstrate the conflict between the dominant conventions underpinning societal development and the objectives of sustainable development. It suggests that a trajectory towards the objectives of sustainable development should be managed through a reflexion concerning the conventional principles required to be adopted in order to favour the emergence of a new conventional regime. The principles of proximity, the increase in individual and collective capabilities, and participative democracy are presented as possible principles that could be adopted in order to favour the emergence of a new conventional regime.",2014,"Environment, Development and Sustainability","10.1007/s10668-014-9539-4",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:153960024",21356

These species add significantly to the diversity of Glires known from the early Paleogene of Asia. E. bayanulanensis and Palaeomylus sp. come from the lowest level of the Bayan Ulan section, from which the classic Bayan Ulan Fauna was collected. Palaeomylus lii and specimens belonging to two other genera of mammals, Pseudictops and Palaeostylops, are found from a horizon about 8 m above strata yielding the Bayan Ulan Fauna. These taxa are tentatively regarded as constituting a distinct faunal assemblage, which may prove to be of biostratigraphic utility within the region. Two calcanea tentatively assigned to Gomphos from a stratigraphic horizon slightly above the bed producing P. lii suggest the presence of strata of Early Eocene age in the Bayan Ulan section.",2005,"American Museum Novitates","10.1206/0003-0082(2005)473[0001:GMFTLP]2.0.CO;2",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10810858",21356

"10628886","The effect of total hip replacement on employment in patients with ankylosing spondylitis","Although total hip replacement (THR) has been proven to be effective, the effect of THR on employment in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Chinese population is still unknown. We aimed to demonstrate whether or not patients with AS returned to work following THR and factors associated with the work ability after THR. We performed a retrospective study including a total number of 128 AS patients undergoing THR between 2009 and 2013. Presurgery and postsurgery data including disease state, work status, type of job, and time of resuming work were collected. Factors associated with early return to work were assessed through ordinal regression. Eighty-seven of 128 patients (68 %) were employed within 1 year before THR and 98 returned to work after surgery. Among them, 21, 46, and 31 resumed work by 3, 6, and 12 months postoperation, respectively. Multivariate ordinal regression showed that patients with unilateral THR, younger age, lower BASFI score, employed presurgery, and low or moderate physical demand were more likely to resume work earlier. Most individuals working presurgery returned to work after THR. For young AS patients with hip involvement, THR is an effective treatment for improving and maintaining work ability.",2016,"Clinical Rheumatology","10.1007/s10067-016-3431-6",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10628886",21356

"18102831","Outcome and Attributable Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With Bacteremia Involving Methicillin-Susceptible and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus","BACKGROUND ::: Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia carries high mortality rates. The clinical impact of methicillin resistance remains controversial: outcome comparisons between patients with bacteremia involving methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S aureus are difficult to perform because of important differences in severity of illness. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: A retrospective cohort analysis and 2 independent case-control analyses were performed to determine and compare outcomes and attributable mortality rates of MSSA (n = 38) and MRSA bacteremia (n = 47) in critically ill patients. For the case-control studies, matching (1:2 ratio) was based on the APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II classification: APACHE II score (+/-1 point) and diagnostic category. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Patients with MRSA bacteremia had more acute renal failure and hemodynamic instability than patients with MSSA bacteremia. They had a longer intensive care unit stay and ventilator dependency. Patients with MRSA bacteremia had a higher 30-day mortality rate (53.2% vs 18.4%) and in-hospital mortality rate (63.8% vs 23.7%) (P<.05). Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated acute renal failure, length of mechanical ventilation, age, and methicillin resistance to be independently associated with mortality (P<.05). The attributable mortality rate for MSSA bacteremia was 1.3%: mortality rates for cases and controls were respectively 23.7% and 22.4% (P =.94). The attributable mortality rate for MRSA bacteremia was 23.4%: mortality rates for cases and controls were respectively 63.8% and 40.4% (P =.02). The difference (22.1%) between both attributable mortality rates was significant (95% confidence interval, 8.8%-35.3%). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: In critically ill patients, after accurate adjustment for disease severity and acute illness, we found MRSA bacteremia to have a higher attributable mortality than MSSA bacteremia.",2002,"Archives of internal medicine","10.1001/archinte.162.19.2229",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18102831",21356

This study is aimed at finding out the translation strategies found in every sentence of that book, and which strategy is dominant in the translation of BBBJ into English. This research is a qualitative one, as the data in this research are words were analyzed by using four steps : analyzing every sentence of each data, grouping the analysis of data in a table, identifying the change of the style of the original text in the translation strategies translation, and providing description and arguments of the result of the data analysis. From the analysis it can be seen that the translation strategies used in Butir – Butir Budaya Jawa are translation by a more general word (45%), translation by cultural substitution (23%), translation by paraphrase using a related word (12%), translation by paraphrase using unrelated word (12%), translation by illustration (5%), translation by using a loan word (1%) and translation by omission (1%). From the finding above, the dominant translation strategy is translation by a more general word (45%). This strategy is applied for the sake of the readability in the target readers and also used if the translator cannot find specific term. Translation using a loan word is used in translating unfamiliar words.Translation by cultural substitution is used if the translator often cannot find the right equivalent between words of one language and the words of another. Translation by omission is used if it is suitable to use technique by omission only when all else has failed.

"1903740","SplayNet: Distributed User-Space Topology Emulation","Network emulation allows researchers to test distributed applications on diverse topologies with fine control over key properties such as delays, bandwidth, congestion, or packet loss. Current approaches to network emulation require using dedicated machines and low-level operating system support. They are generally limited to one user deploying a single topology on a given set of nodes, and they require complex management. These constraints restrict the scope and impair the uptake of network emulation by designers of distributed applications. We propose a set of novel techniques for network emulation that operate only in user-space without specific operating system support. Multiple users can simultaneously deploy several topologies on shared physical nodes with minimal setup complexity. A modular network model allows emulating complex topologies, including congestion at inner routers and links, without any centralized orchestration nor dedicated machine. We implement our user-space network emulation mechanisms in SplayNet, as an extension of an open-source distributed testbed. Our evaluation with a representative set of applications and topologies shows that SplayNet provides accuracy comparable to that of low-level systems based on dedicated machines, while offering better scalability and ease of use.",2013,NA,"10.1007/978-3-642-45065-5_4",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1903740",21356

"119105191","Ranking-Based Autoencoder for Extreme Multi-label Classification","Extreme Multi-label classification (XML) is an important yet challenging machine learning task, that assigns to each instance its most relevant candidate labels from an extremely large label collection, where the numbers of labels, features and instances could be thousands or millions. XML is more and more on demand in the Internet industries, accompanied with the increasing business scale / scope and data accumulation. The extremely large label collections yield challenges such as computational complexity, inter-label dependency and noisy labeling. Many methods have been proposed to tackle these challenges, based on different mathematical formulations. In this paper, we propose a deep learning XML method, with a word-vector-based self-attention, followed by a ranking-based AutoEncoder architecture. The proposed method has three major advantages: 1) the autoencoder simultaneously considers the inter-label dependencies and the feature-label dependencies, by projecting labels and features onto a common embedding space; 2) the ranking loss not only improves the training efficiency and accuracy but also can be extended to handle noisy labeled data; 3) the efficient attention mechanism improves feature representation by highlighting feature importance.

"16497039","Article Multiscale Interactions between Water and Carbon Fluxes and Environmental Variables in A Central U.S. Grassland","The temporal interactions between water and carbon cycling and the controlling environmental variables are investigated using wavelets and information theory. We used 3.5 years of eddy covariance station observations from an abandoned agricultural field in the central U.S. Time-series of the entropy of water and carbon fluxes exhibit pronounced annual cycles, primarily explained by the modulation of the diurnal flux amplitude by other variables, such as the net radiation. Entropies of soil moisture and precipitation show almost no annual cycle, but the data were collected during above average precipitation years, which limits the role of moisture stress on the resultant fluxes. We also investigated the information contribution to resultant fluxes from selected environmental variables as a function of time-scale using relative entropy. The relative entropy of latent heat flux and ecosystem respiration show that the radiation terms contribute the most information to these fluxes at scales up to the diurnal scale. Vapor pressure deficit and air temperature contribute to the most information for the gross primary productivity and net ecosystem exchange at the daily time-scale. The relative entropy between the fluxes and soil moisture illustrates that soil moisture contributes information at approximately weekly time-scales, while the relative entropy with precipitation contributes information predominantly at the monthly time-scale. The use of information theory metrics is a relatively new technique for assessing biosphere-atmosphere interactions, and this study illustrates the utility of the approach for assessing the dominant time-scales of these interactions.",2013,"Entropy","10.3390/e15041324",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16497039",21356

Result Participants who played the game had higher knowledge scores (m = 21.41, standard deviation [SD] = 1.74) than participants in the control group (m = 19.59; SD = 3.31), p = 0.004. The median time of game playing was 6:43 minutes (range: 2:17–16:44). The groups were similar in frequency of completing screening after the study, control = 6 (15%) versus intervention = 11 (32%), p = 0.087. However, the more interaction with the game resulted in more positive attitudes toward screening.

From 2009 to 2015, 839 strains of S. pneumoniae strains were collected (481 from adults and 358 from children). Serotyping by latex antisera and molecular methods was performed. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested. Compared to 2009, the total number of strains isolated in 2015 decreased in children (263 vs. 53, respectively) and in adults (220 vs. 131, respectively). Serotype coverage of PCV13 for IPD decreased significantly in adults from 67.7% (149/220) to 25.2% (33/131) and in children from 75.1% (61/81) to 18.5% (5/27). Especially, serotypes 1, 7F and 19A decreased significantly in children, while serotypes 7F and 19A decreased significantly in adults. PCV13 serotypes involved in AOM decreased significantly over the 5-year period, from 85.7% (156/182) to 38.5% (10/26), and were more susceptible to penicillin, amoxicillin and cefotaxime, p < 0.05. Serotypes 8, 9N and 10A seemed to emerge in adults, whereas any serotype prevalence was observed in children. Between 2009 and 2015, the introduction of PCV13 has resulted in a significant decrease of the number of S. pneumoniae strains isolated from IPD in children as in adults.

The paper presents a novel explanation of order effects, relating to attention and novelty. Typically, multiple valuation tasks for consumer goods use the same good for valuation in each task. In this experiment the type of good valued in each task is varied, allowing two potential mechanisms to be disentangled: experimental novelty effects, whereby participants become less interested with completing later tasks, and good-specific novelty effects, whereby participants become less interested with the goods used in later tasks. The results find a particular importance of the first task; goods in the first task are valued significantly higher than later valued goods, evidence of experimental novelty effects, and goods of a similar type to the good in the first task are valued significantly higher than goods of a different type to the first, evidence of good-specific novelty.

Although use of one dimensional structure provides the enhanced photoelectrical performance, it tends to reduce the adsorption of dye on the TiO2 surface due to decrease of surface area. To overcome this problem, we investigate the effects of TiCl4 treatment on DSSCs which were constructed with composite films made of TiO2 nanoparticles and TNTs. To find optimum condition of TNTs concentration in TiO2 composites film, series of DSSCs with different TNTs concentration were made. In this optimum condition (DSSCs with 10 wt% of TNT), the effects of post treatment are compared for different TiCl4 concentrations.

Results of the ARMYDA-4 RELOAD (Antiplatelet therapy for Reduction of MYocardial Damage during Angioplasty) randomized trial’, by S. Di Sciascio et al. doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehq081 ::: ::: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the predominant form of coronary revascularization in Europe and the USA. Although overall a safe procedure, PCI may be complicated by adverse events, with myocardial infarction (MI) and bleeding being the most frequent and important contributors to mortality and morbidity after the procedure. It is estimated that ∼25% of patients undergoing PCI may have significant post-procedural myonecrosis, as identified by creatinine kinase (CK) and CK-MB isoenzyme elevations, and that up to 50% of PCI patients develop post-procedural troponin elevations.1 The development of strategies that help prevent post-procedural MI has therefore been a major research interest in the field of interventional cardiology. ::: ::: Ever since the late 1990s, it is generally accepted that platelets, adhering and aggregating at sites of endothelial injury and mechanical plaque disruption, are the key determinants of PCI-related myocardial necrosis. Accordingly, several trials, including the Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen (ISAR) trial,2 demonstrated that dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus thienopyridines is efficient in reducing post-PCI ischaemic complications. Since then, dual antiplatelet therapy with the thienopyridine clopidogrel and aspirin has become an integral part of PCI treatment of patients presenting with various forms of coronary artery disease—ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS), and stable angina. ::: ::: An important limitation of clopidogrel, however, lies in its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.3 Clopidogrel is a prodrug that has to undergo two sequential cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-dependent oxidation steps after intestinal absorption in order to be converted into its active metabolite.

The management of the outpatient department should given greater emphasis on its medical facilities in order to ensure the services provided are in high quality, which conforms to customer or patient satisfaction. Long waiting time for treatment at the department is always the main problem faced by the management, and even worst the consultation time is tremendously shorter than the waiting time. This situation has been a common complaint by the patients and remains to occur even though an appointment system is implemented. The implementation of inefficient appointment and inconsistent service time contributes to the dissatisfaction among patients as well as giving a huge impact to the healthcare's overall operations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the multiphase patient flow system in Obstetrics and Gynecology Department (O&G Department) of a specialist centre by developing a simulation model that illustrates the actual patient flow in the department. The Arena 7.0 software package is used to develop the simulation model in order to examine the patient flow, especially the waiting time involved. In addition, 120 questionnaires were distributed to patients to gather direct responds and opinions towards the services provided. The information gathered was used to aid the model improvement process. The result obtained from the simulation model shows that a long waiting time does exist in the system. Based on the developed simulation model, two proposed experimentation are being done to find the right solutions to reduce the patients' waiting time and at the same time enhanced the quality of services of the O&G Department.

"17901668","Sox17 Promotes Cell Cycle Progression and Inhibits TGF-β/Smad3 Signaling to Initiate Progenitor Cell Behavior in the Respiratory Epithelium","The Sry-related high mobility group box transcription factor Sox17 is required for diverse developmental processes including endoderm formation, vascular development, and fetal hematopoietic stem cell maintenance. Expression of Sox17 in mature respiratory epithelial cells causes proliferation and lineage respecification, suggesting that Sox17 can alter adult lung progenitor cell fate. In this paper, we identify mechanisms by which Sox17 influences lung epithelial progenitor cell behavior and reprograms cell fate in the mature respiratory epithelium. Conditional expression of Sox17 in epithelial cells of the adult mouse lung demonstrated that cell cluster formation and respecification of alveolar progenitor cells toward proximal airway lineages were rapidly reversible processes. Prolonged expression of Sox17 caused the ectopic formation of bronchiolar-like structures with diverse respiratory epithelial cell characteristics in alveolar regions of lung. During initiation of progenitor cell behavior, Sox17 induced proliferation and increased the expression of the progenitor cell marker Sca-1 and genes involved in cell cycle progression. Notably, Sox17 enhanced cyclin D1 expression in vivo and activated cyclin D1 promoter activity in vitro. Sox17 decreased the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-responsive cell cycle inhibitors in the adult mouse lung, including p15, p21, and p57, and inhibited TGF-beta1-mediated transcriptional responses in vitro. Further, Sox17 interacted with Smad3 and blocked Smad3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Together, these data show that a subset of mature respiratory epithelial cells retains remarkable phenotypic plasticity and that Sox17, a gene required for early endoderm formation, activates the cell cycle and reinitiates multipotent progenitor cell behavior in mature lung cells.",2009,"PLoS ONE","10.1371/journal.pone.0005711",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17901668",21356

"32445921","Assessing the Accuracy of Three National Physician Sampling Frames","T o the Editor: We feel it is important to provide context and clarity on the use of the AMA Masterfile in the study by DesRoches et al. The study’s methodology has a core weakness that inhibits a meaningful comparison of the disparate databases. We believe the author should have explicitly noted the key differences in the databases that we believe influenced the outcome of the study. The authors selected the AMA’s Physician Preferred Mailing Address (PPMA) to compare against practice addresses from National Plan and Provider Enumeration System and SK&A despite the fact that the AMA PPMA is unique. Of the three databases examined, only the AMA Masterfile allows physicians the choice to include a preferred mailing address, which can, and often does, include a nonpractice address. The fact that the non-practice addresses in the AMA PPMA cannot be matched to NPPES or SK&A or validated by calling the physician’s office, does not make them inaccurate, as suggested by the study. The AMA utilizes its PPMA to successfully route over 25 million mail pieces to physicians annually. Additionally, the AMA processes over 65 million updates to the Masterfile annually, including approximately 31,000 address changes per month. This is the result of compiling data from over 2,000 public and syndicated data sources, including NPPES, and approximately 500,000 inbound and outbound phone interactions with physicians and their practices. For purposes of this study, it would have been more appropriate to include the AMA’s Primary Office Location (POLO), which is more in line with the type of address found in the NPPES and SK&A datasets. It is also important to note that Medical Marketing Service (MMS), the AMA Database Licensee that provided data for the study, did not return information for physicians who were deceased or retired, or who indicated that they do not wish to receive mail, which is important to factor into the NPI match rate results. There are numerous databases that contain information on physicians.

In the first case, researchers are trying to design protocols where users' data will be protected from both internal and external attacks without paying the necessary attention to the problem of user revocation. On the other hand, in the second case existing approaches address the problem of revocation. However, the overall efficiency of these systems is compromised since the proposed protocols are solely based on ABE schemes and the size of the produced ciphertexts and the time required to decrypt grows with the complexity of the access formula. In this paper, we propose a protocol that combines both SSE and ABE in a way that the main advantages of each scheme are used.

Therefore, a simplified but effective and comprehensive approach is demonstrated to give prediction for the exciplex cohosts operating lifespan and analyze their possible degradation mechanisms by considering molecular dissociated activation energy with internal exciton dynamics correlations. As a consequence, strong chemical bond stability for the hole transport moieties and rapid reactive exciton relaxation have the intrinsic talent to access potentially long‐lived exciplex cohosts, achieving an extended lifetime of 10169 h for the predicted long‐lived exciplex cohost OLEDs. Degradation behaviors further confirm that the deteriorated source is attributed to the formation of exciton quenchers and hole traps from excited states and charged‐excited states, respectively.

This growth due to coalescence leads to a gradual decrease in the electrical resistivity up to 95%, independent of the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS films. The primary mechanism for the evolution of the PEDOT-rich cores proceeds by the cores growing larger as they consuming relatively smaller cores. This process is caused by a strain-induced local rearrangement of PEDOT segments in the vicinity of PSS shells around the cores and also changes the chemical environment in PEDOT, induced by the electron-withdrawing effects around the PEDOT chains. The strain-induced growth mechanism is beneficial to understanding the phenomenon of polymeric chain rearrangement in mechanical deformation and to modulating the electrical conductivity for practical applications.",2016,"Scientific reports","10.1038/srep25332",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5803513",21356

Engraftment success was compared between NMRI Foxn1nu and NOD/SCID as well as between fresh and cryopreserved tissue. Established PDX were analyzed histologically and molecularly. Five PDX were experimentally treated with different drugs to assess their potential for preclinical drug testing.ResultsEstablishment of PDX was attempted for 36 consecutive GBM cases with an overall success rate of 22.2% in NMRI Foxn1nu mice. No difference was observed between fresh or cryopreserved (20–1057 days) tissue in direct comparison (n = 10 cases).

"8617725","Mutations in the Drosophila glycoprotein hormone receptor, rickets, eliminate neuropeptide-induced tanning and selectively block a stereotyped behavioral program.","Adult insects achieve their final form shortly after adult eclosion by the combined effects of specialized behaviors that generate increased blood pressure, which causes cuticular expansion, and hormones, which plasticize and then tan the cuticle. We examined the molecular mechanisms contributing to these processes in Drosophila by analyzing mutants for the rickets gene. These flies fail to initiate the behavioral and tanning processes that normally follow ecdysis. Sequencing of rickets mutants and STS mapping of deficiencies confirmed that rickets encodes the glycoprotein hormone receptor DLGR2. Although rickets mutants produce and release the insect-tanning hormone bursicon, they do not melanize when injected with extracts containing bursicon. In contrast, mutants do melanize in response to injection of an analog of cyclic AMP, the second messenger for bursicon. Hence, rickets appears to encode a component of the bursicon response pathway, probably the bursicon receptor itself. Mutants also have a behavioral deficit in that they fail to initiate the behavioral program for wing expansion. A set of decapitation experiments utilizing rickets mutants and flies that lack cells containing the neuropeptide eclosion hormone, reveals a multicomponent control to the activation of this behavioral program.",2002,"The Journal of experimental biology",NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8617725",21356
"14730249","Dynamic and Fault-Tolerant Clustering for Scientific Workflows","Task clustering has proven to be an effective method to reduce execution overhead and to improve the computational granularity of scientific workflow tasks executing on distributed resources. However, a job composed of multiple tasks may have a higher risk of suffering from failures than a single task job. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the impact of transient failures on the runtime performance of scientific workflow executions. We propose a general task failure modeling framework that uses a maximum likelihood estimation-based parameter estimation process to model workflow performance. We further propose three fault-tolerant clustering strategies to improve the runtime performance of workflow executions in faulty execution environments. Experimental results show that failures can have significant impact on executions where task clustering policies are not fault-tolerant, and that our solutions yield makespan improvements in such scenarios. In addition, we propose a dynamic task clustering strategy to optimize the workflow's makespan by dynamically adjusting the clustering granularity when failures arise. A trace-based simulation of five real workflows shows that our dynamic method is able to adapt to unexpected behaviors, and yields better makespans when compared to static methods.",2016,"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","10.1109/TCC.2015.2427200",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14730249",21356
"3633748","Contribution of tumor endothelial cells to drug resistance: anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors act as p-glycoprotein antagonists","Tumor endothelial cells (TEC) differ from the normal counterpart, in both gene expression and functionality. TEC may acquire drug resistance, a characteristic that is maintained in vitro. There is evidence that TEC are more resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs, substrates of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. TEC express p-glycoprotein (encoded by ABCB1), while no difference in other ABC transporters was revealed compared to normal endothelia. A class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), used as angiostatic compounds, interferes with the ATPase activity of p-glycoprotein, thus impairing its functionality. The exposure of ovarian adenocarcinoma TEC to the TKIs sunitinib or sorafenib was found to abrogate resistance (proliferation and motility) to doxorubicin and paclitaxel in vitro, increasing intracellular drug accumulation. A similar effect has been reported by the p-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil. No beneficial effect was observed in combination with cytotoxic drugs that are not p-glycoprotein substrates. The current paper reviews the mechanisms of TEC chemoresistance and shows the role of p-glycoprotein in mediating such resistance. Inhibition of p-glycoprotein by anti-angiogenic TKI might contribute to the beneficial effect of these small molecules, when combined with chemotherapy, in counteracting acquired drug resistance.",2017,"Angiogenesis","10.1007/s10456-017-9549-6",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3633748",21356
"199615984","Clinical efficacy of periosteal pedicle graft with subepithelial connective tissue graft in gingival recession coverage","Introduction: Correction of gingival recession (GR) involves eliminating the cause of recession and it often requires surgical correction. Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) technique by Langer and Langer provides excellent esthetics and is considered most predictable in obtaining marginal tissue recession coverage. However, the requirement of a second surgical procedure for harvesting CTG remote from planned site of recession coverage increases the chances of postoperative infection. There is also a limitation in the amount of graft that can be harvested and an increased operative time contributing to patient discomfort. Materials and Methods: Overcoming these difficulties has become possible with the introduction of “periosteal pedicle graft” (PPG). The study is a split-mouth design where patients with bilateral, isolated GR defects were treated using two different surgical techniques, i.e., PPG versus the SCTG in obtaining GR coverage. The objective was to analyze the comparative amount of root coverage and the gain in width of attached gingiva achieved by both the techniques. Results: All the clinical parameters evaluated were comparable between SCTG and PPG when recorded at 6 and 9 months posttreatment. Conclusion: Both techniques produced satisfactory and predictable results.

"16500148","Pure Single‐Crystalline Na1.1V3O7.9 Nanobelts as Superior Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Sodium‐Ion Batteries","High performance rechargeable batteries are crucial to the development of large‐scale electric energy storage for renewable energies. Following the great success in the field of portable electronics, rechargeable lithium‐ion batteries have risen to prominence as the key energy storage technology for electric vehicle propulsion and in parallel are starting to be evaluated for stationary applications.1 However, we shall always be prepared for the exhaustion of limited and unevenly distributed Li resources in the Earth's crust. In response, room‐temperature Na‐ion batteries (NIBs) have again aroused a great deal of interest recently because Na resources are practically inexhaustible and ubiquitous, which is extremely favorable for large‐scale stationary electric energy storage applications for renewable energies and smart grids.2, 3, 4, 5 However, partially because Na ion is larger and heavier than Li ion, there is still only very limited number of potential cathode materials for NIBs, and the obtained cathode materials are still far from satisfying in terms of specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability.6, 7, 8 Therefore, development of advanced cathode materials for NIBs is urgently desirable but remains a great challenge. ::: ::: Metal vanadates have been proposed as electrode materials due to their structure flexibility, high discharge capacity, and low cost.9 On the other hand, due to their large surface to volume ratio to contact with electrolyte, continuous conducting pathways for electrons through the electrodes, facile strain relaxation during battery operation, etc., 1D structured materials could significantly improve power‐ and energy‐density over bulk electrode materials.10 In these context, nanostructure Ag–V–O and Cu–V–O have been successfully synthesized and showed excellent cathode performances in LIBs;[[qv: 9d–9g]] and single crystalline V2O5 nanobelts indicating a high cathode capacity of 231.4 mAh g−1 for NIBs due to their large interlayer spacing.[[qv: 10c]] However, although alkaline metal vanadates (AMVs) have been found to be potential Li+ and Na+ intercalated electrode materials, there is very few report on AMVs as cathode materials in NIBs, to say nothing of AMVs with uniform morphology, high purity single crystal and 1D structure, which is partially because control of morphology and phase purity of AMVs is very difficult due to their intrinsic phase structure variety and temperature sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, as a representative example of layered AMVs, the encouraging Na1.1V3O7.9 (NVO) can only be synthesized by complicated or time‐consuming route.[[qv: 11a]],[[qv: 11b]] Even though, the obtained NVO holds irregular shape and inextirpable impurity,[[qv: 11c]] which inevitably casts shadow over its application as cathode materials in rechargeable NIBs. Thereafter, developing new strategy to synthesize pure 1D NVO and then exploring their electrochemical performance toward sodium is of great importance. ::: ::: Herein, pure single crystalline Na1.1V3O7.9 nanobelts (NVONBs) are successfully synthesized via a facile and low‐temperature strategy using cheap commercial bulk vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as V and Na precursor, respectively. The Rietveld refinement method shows that the NVONBs hold layered structure which could facilitate Na+ insertion/extraction. Inspired by this structure advantage, when used as cathode materials for NIBs between 1.5 and 3.8 V, the NVONBs exhibit superior electrochemical performances, including high specific capacity of 173 mAh g−1, good cycle stability and rate capability, and high coulombic efficiency. Surprisingly, even after 1000 cycles of fast charging/discharging processes, the morphology of NVONBs could keep almost unchanged. Considering the facility and effectiveness of the synthesis route as well as the very promising electrochemical performances, the results obtained here might be extended to other next generation AMVs cathode materials for NIBs.",2015,"Advanced science","10.1002/advs.201400018",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16500148",21356

More specifically we use a SEEK filter with error modes obtained from system states extracted from the free run within a time interval, typically several months, surrounding the considered assimilation date. The state vector on which are applied the multivariate corrections contained the whole biogeochemical variables. After fine-tuning the assimilation method, we analyze how the realism of the simulation is improved by the assimilation process. This analysis is achieved by comparing several biogeochemical state variables versus assimilation-independent in situ data set in the different bio-provinces of the North Atlantic basin. The results show on average positive performance of the assimilation system on most regions (e.g. in mid-latitude regions ...). However, some weaknesses are identified in coastal regions where key local processes are not considered (e.g. absense of rivers nutrient discharges). This work, which is conducted in the frame of the EU MyOcean project, describes a first approach of the problem that will be further developed in a pre-operational perspective (e.g the setup of a real-time forecasting system, or the production of multi-year hindcasts to improve currently available biogeochemical climatologies).",2011,NA,NA,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129983664",21356

"17425039","Development of an electrical impedance tomograph","This article describes the design of an electrical impedance tomograph (EIT), with the aim to provide a tool to detect morphological changes in tissues. This design consists of an array of 16 electrodes distributed on a ring way. The 4 points technique is used to record the amplitude of the electrical impedance. The array was placed around of a tank filled with a saline solution and objects of different sizes and shapes as test material. The operation of the system is controlled by a program developed on LabVIEW, the impedance data recorded are sent to a MATLAB toolbox called EIDORS to be processing. The final result is a reconstructed image in witch objects larger than 1 cm of contrasting impedance can be recognized.",2011,"2011 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","10.1109/ICEEE.2011.6106665",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17425039",21356
"24386134","The incidence of American swallow bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) in barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) colonies in northeast Texas","The American swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius) is an important ectoparasite of cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) and is known to harbor several types of arbovirus. A recent study in northeast Texas suggested that O. vicarius might occur in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) at rates much higher than previously thought. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which barn swallows in northeast Texas are parasitized by O. vicarius and how well this parasite is adapting to this novel host. A sample of 498 nests at 54 colonies was inspected for O. vicarius. Forty colonies (74.1%) were infected, while 310 nests (62.2%) were infected. Large colonies were more likely to be infected than small colonies. Colonies that also contained cliff swallows were more likely to be infected than colonies without cliff swallows. Infection levels in barn swallow nests were comparable to those reported for cliff swallows, though age and sex class ratios differed. Demographic changes among swallow species, including range expansions, increased colony sizes, and more frequent interspecific nesting associations have likely facilitated the movement of O. vicarius from the cliff swallow into a novel host, the barn swallow.",2007,"Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology","10.3376/1081-1710(2007)32[280:TIOASB]2.0.CO;2",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24386134",21356
