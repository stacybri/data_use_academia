"9968425","Factors Influencing the Successful Completion of Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy","Objective: To analyze the preoperative factors contributing to the decision to convert laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. Methods: Retrospective identification of 324 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with univariate and multivariate analysis of the following parameters: age, gender, obesity, previous abdominal surgery, presentation with acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or obstructive jaundice, gallbladder wall thickening, gallbladder or common bile duct stones. Results: Thirty-nine patients (12%) underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy. Patients aged over 65 years were four times more likely to require conversion than patients under 50 years of age. Under 50 years of age, males had equal conversion rates to females, and above this age there was a non-significant increased conversion rate in males. Obese patients had higher conversion rates than non-obese patients (23% versus 9%, P 0.003). Thirty-eight percent of patients with choledocholithiasis required conversion. Age, acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis independently predicted conversion. A patient aged less than fifty years with neither acute cholecystitis nor choledocholithiasis had a conversion rate of just 2%, while almost 60% of those over 65 years of age with acute cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis required conversion. Conclusion: The parameters of age, acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis must be considered in the clinical decision making process when planning laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",2009,"JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons","10.4293/108680809X1258998404560",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9968425",21356

"11979714","Endoscopic Strip Craniectomy in Early Infancy: The Initial Five Years of Anesthesia Experience","BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive endoscopic strip craniectomy (ESC) is a relatively new surgical technique for treating craniosynostosis in early infancy. In this study we reviewed our anesthesia experience with ESC. The hypothesis was that infants with low body weight and syndromes would have a higher risk of perioperative blood transfusion and that those with respiratory complications are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patient charts and anesthesia records of the first 100 consecutive infants who underwent ESC between May 2004 and December 2008 and follow-up evaluations until December 2009. Outcomes included (a) perioperative blood transfusion, (b) venous air embolism (VAE), (c) ICU admission, and (d) reoperation with craniofacial reconstruction procedures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine significant factors of patient outcomes. RESULTS: Infants ranging from 4 to 34 weeks of age (weight: 3.2 to 10.1 kg), presented for 87 single and 13 multiple ESC. Four infants had a craniofacial syndrome. The mean surgical time was 48 minutes (range: 26 to 86 minutes). Ninety-two infants had a median estimated blood loss of 23 mL (interquartile ranges [IQR]: 15 to 30 mL). Eight infants who required blood transfusion received a median amount of 17.2 mL/kg (IQR: 10.1 to 21.2 mL/kg). Body weight ≤5 kg (P = 0.04), sagittal ESC (P < 0.01), syndromic craniosynostosis (P < 0.01), and earlier date of surgery in the series (P < 0.01) were factors associated with blood transfusion. VAE was detected in 2 infants with no changes in clinical outcome. Eight infants were admitted to the ICU. Factors associated with ICU admission were blood transfusion (P < 0.001) and respiratory complications (P < 0.001). Eighty-two infants were discharged on postoperative day 1 (range: 1 to 3 days). Six infants underwent subsequent fronto-orbital advancement and 1 cranial vault reconstruction. Multiple-suture craniosynostosis (P < 0.01), associated syndromes (P = 0.03), and ICU admission after ESC (P = 0.04) were predictive of reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty percent of infants undergoing ESC had 1 or more of the following: need for blood transfusion, VAE, respiratory complications, and ICU admission. Multivariable analysis confirmed that patients with lower body weight, those with earlier date of surgery in the series, those undergoing sagittal ESC, and those with syndromic craniosynostosis had a higher rate of blood transfusion. ICU admissions often occurred in infants requiring transfusion and those with respiratory complications. Infants with multiple-suture craniosynostosis were more likely to require subsequent craniofacial reconstruction procedures.",2011,"Anesthesia and analgesia","10.1213/ANE.0b013e31820471e4",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11979714",21356

A total of 73 pregnancies at 40 to 42 weeks of gestation were included. After labor was induced, 29 women delivered vaginally and 44 underwent cesarean section. These groups were compared with respect to possible predictive parameters of delivery outcomes. Studentt test, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical evaluation. Mean preinduction cervical length was 26.8±9.9 mm in the vaginal delivery group and 34.2±8.1 mm in the cesarean section group (P < .05). Mean maternal age, parity, and Bishop score were significantly higher and mean weight of the newborn was significantly lower in the vaginal delivery group. Cervical length measurements showed a significant negative correlation with Bishop scores (r=−.584;P < .05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that Bishop score (likelihood ratio=.472; 95% confidence interval=.338–.658;P < .05) and weight of the newborn (likelihood ratio=1.002; 95% confidence interval=1 .00007–1.003;P < .05) were significant independent predictors of the route of delivery. According to the results of this study, maternal age, parity, Bishop score, cervical length, and weight of the newborn all might affect the mode of delivery after labor induction. Bishop score, although a subjective measure, must be considered an important component of preinduction evaluation.",2007,"Advances in therapy","10.1007/BF02849968",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46237339",21356

The olfactory-based control strategies have been developed an important means for pest management. Streltzoviella insularis is a destructive insect pest of many street tree species, and characterization of its olfactory proteins could provide targets for the disruption of their odour recognition processes and for urban forestry protection. In this study, we assembled the antennal transcriptome of S. insularis by next-generation sequencing and annotated the main olfactory multi-gene families, including 28 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 12 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 56 odorant receptors (ORs), 11 ionotropic receptors (IRs), two sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), and 101 odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs). Sequence and phylogenetic analyses confirmed the characteristics of these proteins. We further detected tissue- and sex-specific expression patterns of OBPs, CSPs and SNMPs by quantitative real time-PCR. Most OBPs were highly and differentially expressed in the antennae of both sexes. SinsCSP10 was expressed more highly in male antennae than in other tissues. Two SNMPs were highly expressed in the antennae, with no significant difference in expression between the sexes.

An optical pickup head of commercial digital versatile disc read only memory (DVD-ROM) drive is applied in this sensor system. In order to satisfy the strict measuring requirements of sensibility and reliability, the build-in detection system is replaced with a four-quadrant photodiode of traditional optical-lever technique. In addition, an inertial motor composed by a piezo-actuator is used as the sample approaching mechanism and the scanner in the vertical direction. Thus, the volume of hardware structure is decreased, and the sensing variance due to temperature change will be minimized.

"215721973","In-Depth Analysis of Signal Jammers' and Anti-Jamming Effect on 5G Signal","Most technologies nowadays communicate by way of transmitting and receiving signal. The way devices communicate is increasingly changing in complexity and while threats have evolved, techniques and technologies to counteract them have stagnated in comparison. One of the most persistent threats to signal transmission is signal jamming. The rapid development of technologies such as wireless communication which includes mobile phone signal transmission, Wi-Fi, critical infrastructure communications as well as IoT have attracted increased levels of signal jamming to disrupt, interfere and in some instances, block the transmission entirely. Signal jammers have come a long way in terms of both complexity as well as affordability. These jammer devices work by overwhelming the transmitting signal as way of ""shouting louder"" than legitimate signal and as a result, disrupt and block it. The importance of understanding this threat is more precarious when critical telecommunication infrastructure is considered: - GSM Communications (Disruption of phone communications) - Defense Ministry Communications (Disruption of sensitive communications) - Emergency Services Communications (Disruption of potentially mission-critical, health or security communications) Available research and literature tackled this problem with varying degrees of success.

With this technology, it is possible to independently control the energy of the AlN radicals in the ablated plasma and the nitrogen ions in the ion beam to improve the quality of the deposited thin films. Moreover, the nitrogen ion implantation can also compensate the loss of nitrogen species in the ablation process.

To investigate how information is encoded and transmitted through this circuit, we performed electrophysiological recordings in mice observing a demonstrator mouse undergo associative fear conditioning and found that BLA-projecting ACC (ACC→BLA) neurons preferentially encode socially derived aversive cue information. Inhibition of ACC→BLA alters real-time amygdala representation of the aversive cue during observational conditioning. Selective inhibition of the ACC→BLA projection impaired acquisition, but not expression, of observational fear conditioning.

"1086358","Stilbenoids remodel the DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer cells and inhibit oncogenic NOTCH signaling through epigenetic regulation of MAML2 transcriptional activity","DNA hypomethylation was previously implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. The purpose of this study was to examine whether stilbenoids, resveratrol and pterostilbene thought to exert anticancer effects, target genes with oncogenic function for de novo methylation and silencing, leading to inactivation of related signaling pathways. Following Illumina 450K, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis reveals that stilbenoids alter DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer cells. On average, 75% of differentially methylated genes have increased methylation, and these genes are enriched for oncogenic functions, including NOTCH signaling pathway. MAML2, a coactivator of NOTCH targets, is methylated at the enhancer region and transcriptionally silenced in response to stilbenoids, possibly explaining the downregulation of NOTCH target genes. The increased DNA methylation at MAML2 enhancer coincides with increased occupancy of repressive histone marks and decrease in activating marks. This condensed chromatin structure is associated with binding of DNMT3B and decreased occupancy of OCT1 transcription factor at MAML2 enhancer, suggesting a role of DNMT3B in increasing methylation of MAML2 after stilbenoid treatment. Our results deliver a novel insight into epigenetic regulation of oncogenic signals in cancer and provide support for epigenetic-targeting strategies as an effective anticancer approach.",2016,"Carcinogenesis","10.1093/carcin/bgw048",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1086358",21356

These T cells differentiated and were primed in vivo in irradiation chimeras constructed of various combinations of F1 and parental bone marrow donors and irradiated recipients. Primed T cells were then tested for helper activity in the in vitro response of B cells and macrophages (Mphi) of parental or F1 origin to the hapten trinitrophenol coupled to the priming antigen. When testing either SRBC or KLH-specific T cells of parental H-2 type which had differentiated in F1 hosts, we found that they cooperated equally well with B cells and Mphi of either parental H-2 type. On the other hand, when testing F1 T cells which had differentiated in parental hosts, we found that they cooperated well only with B cells and Mphi which had the K-IA region type of the parental host. In similar experiments we found that (T,G)-A--L-specific T cells of low responder H-2 type which had differentiated in (high responder X low responder) F1 hosts induced high responses in high responder B cells and Mphi (T,G)-A--L-specific F1 T cells which differentiated in high responder but not those which differentiated in low responder hosts induced high responses in high responder B cells and Mphi. Low responder B cells and Mphi yielded low responses in all cases regardless of the source of (T,G)-A--L-specific T cells with what they were tested. Our results support the conclusion that I-region and Ir genes function via their expression in B cells and Mphi and in the host environment during helper T-cell differentiation, but not, at least under the conditions of these experiments, via their expression in the helper T cell itself.

First, the study assumes the physical process can be described by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. In the light of the T-S fuzzy model of the plant, the fuzzy observer comprises a number of locally linear observers and the final state estimate is a fuzzy fusion of all local observer outputs.

The occurrence of già under negation in questions is unexpected because già cannot be licensed in declarative sentences with sentential negation (It. *Non ho già fatto colazione. literally ‘I did not have breakfast already.’). The empirical contribution of this paper is to provide a corpus analysis and to describe the contexts in which già can appear under negation. The main research questions of this paper are as follows: (i) how do we account for the distribution and the licensing conditions of già under negation? and (ii) how is the meaning of già related to its distribution? This paper shows that some syntactic restrictions are responsible for the distribution of già under negation, and that in contexts where già appears under negation in questions or conditionals, it is not interpreted under the direct scope of negation.",2018,"Linguistics","10.1515/ling-2017-0040",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149291868",21356

However, the efficacy of TESE in this indication is burdened by a frequent failure of sperm recovery, which renders useless both the invasive testicular intervention and ovarian stimulation of the patient's spouse. One of the most frequent pathological pictures characterizing complete absence of spermatozoa is germinal aplasia (Sertoli cell- only syndrome or SCOS). Two different histological patterns of SCOS have been already described during the past five decades. These two patterns can be characterized as the congenital (pure) and the secondary (mixed) forms. Both patterns, with different prognosis to retrieve spermatozoa by therapeutic testicular biopsy, are frequently confused when TESE is performed during ICSI programmes. Useful criteria to predict the absence of spermatozoa can be obtained by a definite recognition of the two typical histological patterns during the diagnostic testicular biopsy. The diagnosis of congenital or acquired SCOS can be refined by endocrine, chemical, immunohistochemical and molecular biology aids.

"16687380","Single-Phase Zero Reactive Power Wireless Power Transfer Topologies Based on Boucherot Bridge Circuit Concept","High reliability and cost effectiveness of power electronic components have resulted in high level of interest in wireless power transfer techniques among academic and industrial professionals. Since the major interest is directed toward automotive and rail industries for electromagnetically coupled fast battery charging systems, a special transformer with a large gap and relatively large leakage inductance is used. To achieve desired voltage and power levels with a reasonable compact-sized transformer, high frequencies in the order of 20-100 kHz are preferred, producing high levels of reactive power, which limit the amount of transferred power and efficiency if not compensated. There are four basic transformer compensation topologies reported in the literature, each being the combination of series and/or parallel compensations. This paper presents all four topologies and the associated input-to-output dependence based on a Boucherot bridge model of a transformer. Analytical modeling predictions are supported by finite-element analysis results to provide the proof of conceptual finding of this technology.

This review considers briefly current trends in proteomics technologies and understanding the causes of critical issues that need to be addressed--i.e., incomplete data coverage and inter-sample inconsistency. On the coverage issue, we argue that holistic analysis based on biological networks provides a suitable background on which more robust models and interpretations can be built upon; and we introduce some recently developed approaches. On consistency, group-based approaches based on identified clusters, as well as on properly integrated pathway databases, are particularly useful. Despite that protein interactions and pathway networks are still largely incomplete, given proper quality checks, applications and reasonably sized data sets, they yield valuable insights that greatly complement data generated from quantitative proteomics.",2012,"Proteomics","10.1002/pmic.201100321",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9902420",21356

To investigate whether FLCs are useful as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker in Japanese patients with primary systemic AL amyloidosis, we determined these values in serum before and after chemotherapy. ::: ::: ::: PATIENTS AND METHODS ::: The serum FLC analysis was carried out in 25 patients with primary systemic AL amyloidosis (mean age, 60.1+/-8.4 years). All of the patients were shown to have either ALkappa- or ALlambda-immunoreactive amyloid deposits on biopsied tissues. Thirteen patients were treated with VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) alone (n=6) or VAD and subsequent high-dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell support (n=7), and serum FLCs were serially determined before and after the chemotherapy. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Before chemotherapy the amyloidogenic FLC was elevated in serum with or without abnormal e/e ratios in 24 patients, including 5 with undetectable M-protein in both serum and urine on immunofixation.

The incidence of adverse events (AEs), results of laboratory tests, vital sign assessments, and treatment satisfaction were assessed. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Of the 269 patients (de novo, 179; rollover, 90) who entered the maintenance period, 163 (60.6 %) completed the study; the primary reason for discontinuation was an AE (22.3 %). Eighty percent of patients identified an effective dose of fentanyl sublingual spray (median dose, 600 μg).

"44102479","Preparing Fresh Retinal Slices from Adult Zebrafish for Ex Vivo Imaging Experiments","The retina is a complex tissue that initiates and integrates the first steps of vision. Dysfunction of retinal cells is a hallmark of many blinding diseases, and future therapies hinge on fundamental understandings about how different retinal cells function normally. Gaining such information with biochemical methods has proven difficult because contributions of particular cell types are diminished in the retinal cell milieu. Live retinal imaging can provide a view of numerous biological processes on a subcellular level, thanks to a growing number of genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors. However, this technique has thus far been limited to tadpoles and zebrafish larvae, the outermost retinal layers of isolated retinas, or lower resolution imaging of retinas in live animals. Here we present a method for generating live ex vivo retinal slices from adult zebrafish for live imaging via confocal microscopy. This preparation yields transverse slices with all retinal layers and most cell types visible for performing confocal imaging experiments using perfusion. Transgenic zebrafish expressing fluorescent proteins or biosensors in specific retinal cell types or organelles are used to extract single-cell information from an intact retina. Additionally, retinal slices can be loaded with fluorescent indicator dyes, adding to the method's versatility. This protocol was developed for imaging Ca2+ within zebrafish cone photoreceptors, but with proper markers it could be adapted to measure Ca2+ or metabolites in Muller cells, bipolar and horizontal cells, microglia, amacrine cells, or retinal ganglion cells. The retinal pigment epithelium is removed from slices so this method is not suitable for studying that cell type. With practice, it is possible to generate serial slices from one animal for multiple experiments. This adaptable technique provides a powerful tool for answering many questions about retinal cell biology, Ca2+, and energy homeostasis.",2018,"Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","10.3791/56977",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44102479",21356

Despite the potential for substantial improvement in function with acute rehabilitation, the factors affecting its cost have not yet been evaluated. We used a proprietary hospital database to evaluate the direct costs of rehabilitation after spine injury. Methods A single-center, retrospective cohort cost analysis of patients with acute, traumatic spine injury treated at a tertiary facility from 2011 to 2017 was performed. Results In the 190 patients (mean age 46.1 ± 18.6 years, 76.3% males) identified, American Spinal Injury Association impairment scores on admission were 32.1% A, 14.7% B, 14.7% C, 33.2% D, and 1.1% E. Surgical treatment was performed in 179 (94.2%) cases. Most injuries were in the cervical spine (53.2%). A mean improvement of Functional Impairment Score of 30.7 ± 16.2 was seen after acute rehabilitation. Costs for care comprised facility (86.5%), pharmacy (9.2%), supplies (2.0%), laboratory (1.5%), and imaging (0.8%) categories. Injury level, injury severity, and prior inpatient surgical treatment did not affect the cost of rehabilitation. Higher injury severity (p = 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) and spinal level of injury (p = 0.001, one-way ANOVA) were associated with higher length of rehabilitation stay in univariate analysis. However, length of rehabilitation stay was the strongest independent predictor of higher-than-median cost (risk ratio = 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.0, p = 0.001) after adjusting for other factors. Conclusions Spine injury has a high upfront cost of care, with greater need for rehabilitation substantially affecting cost.

"9517670","Differential Regulation of the Variations Induced by Environmental Richness in Adult Neurogenesis as a Function of Time: A Dual Birthdating Analysis","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) augments after environmental enrichment (EE) and it has been related to some of the anxiolytic, antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of EE. Indeed, it has been suggested that EE specifically modulates hippocampal neurogenic cell populations over the course of time. Here we have used dual-birthdating to study two subpopulations of newborn neuron in mice (Mus musculus): those born at the beginning and at the end of enrichment. In this way, we demonstrate that while short-term cell survival is upregulated after an initial 1 week period of enrichment in 2 month old female mice, after long-term enrichment (2 months) neither cell proliferation nor the survival of the younger newly born cell populations are distinguishable from that observed in non-enriched control mice. In addition, we show that the survival of older newborn neurons alone (i.e. those born at the beginning of the enrichment) is higher than in controls, due to the significantly lower levels of cell death. Indeed, these parameters are rapidly adjusted to the sudden cessation of the EE conditions. These findings suggest both an early selective, long-lasting effect of EE on the neurons born in the initial stages of enrichment, and a quick response when the environment again becomes impoverished. Therefore, EE induces differential effects on distinct subpopulations of newborn neurons depending on the age of the immature cells and on the duration of the EE itself. The interaction of these two parameters constitutes a new, specific regulation of these neurogenic populations that might account for the long-term enrichment's behavioral effects.",2010,"PLoS ONE","10.1371/journal.pone.0012188",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9517670",21356

Thereafter, girls started with 17beta-estradiol (5 microg/kg bw x day, orally) when they had reached the age of 12 yr. Subjects were followed up until attainment of adult height or until cessation of treatment because of satisfaction with the height achieved. Seven-year data of all girls were evaluated to compare the growth-promoting effects of three GH dosages during childhood. After 7 yr, 85% of the girls had reached a height within the normal range for healthy Dutch girls. The 7-yr increment in height SD-score was significantly higher in groups B and C than in group A. In addition, we evaluated the data of 32 of the 68 girls who had completed the trial after a mean duration of treatment of 7.3 yr (range, 5.0 - 8.75). Mean (SD) height was 158.8 cm (7.1), 161.0 cm (6.8), and 162.3 cm (6.1) in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The mean (SD) difference between predicted adult height before treatment and achieved height was 12.5 cm (2.1), 14.5 cm (4.0), and 16.0 cm (4.1) for groups A, B, and C, respectively, being significantly different between group A and group C. GH treatment was well tolerated in all three GH dosage groups. In conclusion, GH treatment starting in relatively young girls with TS results in normalization of height during childhood, as well as of adult height, in most of the individuals. With this GH and estrogen treatment regimen, most girls with TS can grow and develop much more in conformity with their healthy peers.",1999,"The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","10.1210/jcem.84.12.6241",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1119669",21356

Additionally, applications running in Tactical Edge Networks often follow one-to-many and many-to-many communication models that require the nodes' cooperation to enable data delivery. Many studies proposed the use of peer-to-peer systems in mobile ad hoc networks to remove any dependency on centralized nodes and to cope with link disruptions and network partitioning phenomena that derive from the extreme dynamicity of Tactical Edge Networks. In this paper, we compare the performance of file sharing in mobile ad hoc networks using an implementation of the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol and DisService, a middleware for information dissemination specifically designed for Tactical Edge Networks. DisService supports applications with routing and peer-to-peer content delivery in mobile ad hoc networks. We ran several experiments in an emulated environment to evaluate the performance of each solution when sharing large files.

Although poverty alleviation strategies in Malaysia have been acclaimed success by United Nation Development Programme (UNDP, 2013), new form of poverty emerged in urban area as a result of rapid economic growth and development. Poverty is a multifaceted phenomenon and different societies have different perceptions of poverty. These will led to uncertainty in determining of poverty. Most of welfare institutions in Malaysia measure poverty from the monetary perspective using monthly income or expenditure. In practice, conventional institutions such as Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat Malaysia (JKMM) use monetary approach in determining poverty through the Poverty Line Income (PLI). While, Islamic institutions adopt the monetary approach in determining poverty using Had Al-Kifayah (HAK). The objective of this paper is to explain the concept and analyze the uncertainty factors that have contributed to the incidence of poverty in urban area using PLI and HAK method. This study would highlight the similarities and differences of both the methods.

Background Epicardial catheter ablation for ventricular arrhythmias (VA) is an important therapeutic option in patients after endocardial ablation failure. However, epicardial mapping and ablation are limited by the presence of coronary arteries and epicardial fat. Methods Twenty-eight patients (21 male, age 59 ± 16 years) underwent combined endo-epicardial electroanatomical mapping. Prior to the procedure, MDCT derived coronary anatomy and epicardial fat meshes were loaded into the mapping system (CARTO XP, Biosense Webster Inc, Diamond Bar, California). Real-time registration of MDCT data was performed after endocardial mapping. The distance between epicardial ablation sites and coronary arteries was assessed by registered MDCT and angiography. After the procedure, mapping and ablation points were superimposed on the MDCT using a reversed registration matrix for head-to-head comparison of mapping data and corresponding fat thickness. Results Image registration was successful and accurate in all patients (position error 2.8 ± 1.3 mm). At sites without evidence for scar, epicardial bipolar voltage decreased significantly (p Conclusions Real-time image integration of pre-acquired MDCT information is feasible and accurate.

"29828889","Perspective of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) containing ACC deaminase in stress agriculture","Ethylene is a gaseous plant growth hormone produced endogenously by almost all plants. It is also produced in soil through a variety of biotic and abiotic mechanisms, and plays a key role in inducing multifarious physiological changes in plants at molecular level. Apart from being a plant growth regulator, ethylene has also been established as a stress hormone. Under stress conditions like those generated by salinity, drought, waterlogging, heavy metals and pathogenicity, the endogenous production of ethylene is accelerated substantially which adversely affects the root growth and consequently the growth of the plant as a whole. Certain plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) contain a vital enzyme, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which regulates ethylene production by metabolizing ACC (an immediate precursor of ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants) into α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. Inoculation with PGPR containing ACC deaminase activity could be helpful in sustaining plant growth and development under stress conditions by reducing stress-induced ethylene production. Lately, efforts have been made to introduce ACC deaminase genes into plants to regulate ethylene level in the plants for optimum growth, particularly under stressed conditions. In this review, the primary focus is on giving account of all aspects of PGPR containing ACC deaminase regarding alleviation of impact of both biotic and abiotic stresses onto plants and of recent trends in terms of introduction of ACC deaminase genes into plant and microbial species.",2007,"Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology","10.1007/s10295-007-0240-6",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29828889",21356

In conjugated polymers, charges give rise to additional absorption of light at wavelengths longer than those absorbed by the electrically neutral species. These characteristic absorption bands are universally being related to the emergence of localized energy levels shifted into the forbidden gap of organic semiconductors due to local relaxation of the molecular geometry. However, the traditional view on these energy levels and their occupation is incompatible with expected changes in electron removal and addition energies upon charging molecules. Here, I demonstrate that local Coulomb repulsion, as captured by nonempirically optimized electronic-structure calculations, restores compatibility and suggests a different origin of the charge-induced optical transitions.

"16566021","Lymphatic vessel density and prognosis in cutaneous melanoma","Sir, ::: ::: Recent studies have focused on the possible prognostic importance of lymphatic vessel density (LVD) in malignant melanoma, and we have read the paper by Shields et al (2004) with great interest. Based on their data, the authors suggest that the assessment of lymphatic vessel density (LVD) might give prognostic information in cutaneous melanoma. As they point out, some conclusions of their study might, in part, be in discordance with our own report (Straume et al, 2003), and we would therefore like to discuss some aspects of their work. ::: ::: So far, relatively few survival studies on lymphangiogenesis have been published. In 2001, Birner et al (2001) presented a study on cervical cancer, and later our group published the first survival study of melanomas, based on 175 cases of aggressive vertical growth phase melanoma of the nodular type (median thickness 3.6 mm) (Straume et al, 2003). The results of both these studies indicate that increased LVD is associated with improved patient survival. More recently, however, Valencak et al (2004) published a prognostic study of 120 melanoma patients showing a weak association between increased LVD and reduced survival, although in univariate analysis only. In a study by Dadras et al (2003), based on the selection of 19 nonmetastatic melanoma patients and 18 patients with early lymph node metastasis, intratumour LVD was found to be increased in the metastatic group. In the study of Shields et al, including 21 melanoma cases (eight nonmetastatic, mean thickness 2.3 mm, and 11 metastatic, mean thickness 3.4 mm), LVD was also higher in tumours that developed metastases. Interestingly, LVD tended to decrease with increasing tumour thickness (their Table 2). No follow-up information (time to events) was presented. Whereas these three studies (Dadras et al, 2003; Shields et al, 2004; Valencak et al, 2004) seem to imply that increased LVD is associated with tumour progression and poor prognosis, the contrary was found in our own study (Straume et al, 2003). What could explain this difference? ::: ::: Several explanations might be considered. We agree with Shields et al that the ‘hot spot’ technique, originally described by Weidner et al (1991) for the estimation of angiogenesis, might be more applicable for blood microvascular capillaries, and this approach is more subjective. The authors discuss whether some of the differences in our results could be attributed to this fact. Although our two studies showed comparable values of mean epi/peri-tumoral LVD (10.0 vs 14.3 mm−2), we wanted to address this issue and selected 19 lethal and 21 nonlethal melanoma cases from our series (Straume et al, 2003), and tumours were matched for thickness. Lymphatic vessels were counted along the complete tumour border in consecutive high power fields (HPF, × 400), and vessels more than 1 HPF away from the invasive border were not counted. We found that the median absolute LVD (LVD-ABS) was 5.4 vessels mm−2 compared with 12.5 mm−2 by the ‘hot spot’ technique (LVD-HS) (7.0 in nonlethal cases, 3.4 in lethal cases), and LVD-ABS and LVD-HS were highly correlated (linear regression R=0.74, P<0.001 for continuous variables, and Pearson χ2 R=0.7, P<0.001 when categorised between lymphatic vessel rich or poor cases). Most importantly, the analysis of both overall survival (melanoma deaths only) and recurrence-free survival showed the same association for both LVD-ABS and LVD-HS, that is, improved survival by increased LVD-ABS (log rank P=0.005, n=40) and increased LVD-HS (log rank P<0.0001, n=169). These data indicate that the difference in results cannot be explained by the difference in counting technique only. Still, we agree that LVD-ABS might be more appropriate and more easily standardised than LVD-HS, as suggested by Shields. ::: ::: In the study by Dadras et al (2003), 18 metastatic and 19 nonmetastatic melanomas were included (mean thickness 2.5 mm, 68% Clark 4–5; mainly (76%) superficial spreading melanomas). The median peritumoral LVD (12.8 mm−2) was almost identical with our own findings (12.5 mm−2), suggesting that both methods (Dadras: computer-assisted morphometric analysis; Straume: counting in ‘hot spot’ areas a.m. Weidner) gave similar results. Even if low reproducibility is considered an important problem of vessel counting (Hlatky et al, 2002), this method is frequently used in translational angiogenesis research; other methods, including morphometry, have not proved to be superior. ::: ::: The study of Valencak et al (2004) included 120 cases of cutaneous melanoma with follow-up information (median thickness not given; 18% of patients were Clark 0–2, 45% were Clark 4–5; in comparison, 90% were Clark 4–5 in our own study). By staining for podoplanin, and using the ‘hot spot’ method of counting, the mean LVD was 11.3 per field (field size not given), and this is probably considerably higher than in the other studies. Increased LVD was associated with decreased survival, but the difference was only modest and did not persist in multivariate analysis, in contrast to what we found (Straume et al, 2003). The use of different markers could be one explanation for the findings, although LVD by LYVE-1 and podoplanin staining was significantly correlated in our previous study. Also, the sensitivity and specificity of the LYVE-1 antibody were evaluated in a recent study by Akishima et al (2004). ::: ::: It should be pointed out that our series (Straume et al, 2003) consisted of thicker and more advanced primary melanomas than the other series, consisting of vertical growth phase melanomas only. This could be an important explanation why the relationship between LVD and progression/prognosis appears to be different. Interestingly, we found a significant association between increased LVD and lymphocytic infiltration, which is a favourable prognostic factor for cutaneous melanomas, and a similar relationship with lymphatic vascular area was found by Dadras et al (2003). This points to a relationship between lymphatic vessels and an antitumour immune response. ::: ::: The studies of Dadras et al and Shields et al have included a low number of pre-selected cases and might not be classified as prognostic factor studies according to the criteria of Simon and Altman (1994). For instance, Dadras et al did not present prognostic information on LVD, but found that relative lymphatic vessel area was a prognostic factor, although their cut-points appear to be selected on the basis of a relationship with a strong predictor of outcome, that is, lymph node metastases (their Figure 6A). The ‘prognostic’ information from these studies should therefore be interpreted with great care. A summary of studies of clinical end points according to lymphatic markers in human cancers has recently been given by Padera et al (2003). ::: ::: The results of animal studies have suggested that increased lymphangiogenesis may be important for the frequency of lymphatic metastasis, and the recent identification of novel lymphangiogenic factors, like VEGF-C and VEGF-D, has increased the focus on lymphangiogenesis considerably (Kaipainen et al, 1995; Achen et al, 1998; Skobe et al, 2001; Stacker et al, 2001). Still, the evidence provided in the literature is not sufficient to conclude that active lymphangiogenesis play an important role in human cancer. As for the difference between studies on cutaneous melanoma, the balance between LVD as a marker of lymphatic spread, and its association with lymphocytic infiltration and antitumour immune activity, might differ between early (thinner) and late stage (thicker) melanomas. Also, the relative contribution of lymphogenic and hematogenic metastases may be different between these tumour subgroups. We feel that more survival studies, following the criteria of Simon and Altman (1994), are needed before the estimation of lymphangiogenesis is applicable to clinical decision making and prognostication in melanoma patients.",2004,"British Journal of Cancer","10.1038/sj.bjc.6602122",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16566021",21356

"199465611","The conduction pathway of potassium channels is water free under physiological conditions","Ion conduction through potassium channels is a fundamental process of life. On the basis of crystallographic data, it was originally proposed that potassium ions and water molecules are transported through the selectivity filter in an alternating arrangement, suggesting a “water-mediated” knock-on mechanism. Later on, this view was challenged by results from molecular dynamics simulations that revealed a “direct” knock-on mechanism where ions are in direct contact. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques tailored to characterize the interaction between water molecules and the ion channel, we show here that the selectivity filter of a potassium channel is free of water under physiological conditions. Our results are fully consistent with the direct knock-on mechanism of ion conduction but contradict the previously proposed water-mediated knock-on mechanism.",2019,"Science advances","10.1126/sciadv.aaw6756",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199465611",21356

In this phase I trial, the safety of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib was studied. ::: ::: ::: PATIENTS AND METHODS ::: High-dose sorafenib was administered once weekly in exposure escalation cohorts according to a 3 + 3 design. Drug monitoring was performed in weeks 1-3 and doses were adjusted to achieve a predefined target plasma area under the curve (AUC)(0-12 h). The effect of low gastric pH on improving sorafenib exposure was investigated by intake of the acidic beverage cola. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Seventeen patients with advanced malignancies without standard treatment options were included. Once weekly, high-dose sorafenib exposure was escalated up to a target AUC(0-12 h) of 125-150 mg/L/h, achieving a twofold higher Cmax compared to standard continuous dosing. Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in three patients: grade 3 duodenal perforation (2800 mg sorafenib), grade 5 multiorgan failure (2800 mg sorafenib) and grade 5 biliary tract perforation (3600 mg sorafenib). The mean difference between observed and target AUC(0-12 h) was 45% (SD ± 56%) in week 1 using a fixed starting dose of sorafenib compared to 2% (SD ± 32%) in week 3 as a result of drug monitoring (P = 0.06). Dissolving sorafenib in cola, instead of water, did not improve sorafenib exposure. Clinical benefit with stable disease as the best response was observed in two patients. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Treatment with high-dose, once weekly sorafenib administration resulted in dose-limiting toxicity precluding dose escalation above the exposure cohort of 125-150 mg/L/h.

"206168647","Minimising food waste: a call for multidisciplinary research","Food losses and waste have always been a significant global problem for mankind, and one which has become increasingly recognised as such by policy makers, food producers, processors, retailers, and consumers. It is, however, an emotive subject whereby the extent, accuracy and resolution of available data on postharvest loss and waste are questionable, such that key performance indicators on waste can be misinformed. The nature and extent of food waste differ among developed economies, economies in transition and developing countries. While most emphasis has been put on increasing future crop production, far less resource has been and is still channelled towards enabling both established and innovative food preservation technologies to reduce food waste while maintaining safety and quality. Reducing food loss and waste is a more tractable problem than increasing production in the short to medium term, as its solution is not directly limited, for instance, by available land and water resources. Here we argue the need for a paradigm shift of current funding strategies and research programmes that will encourage the development, implementation and translation of collective biological, engineering and management solutions to better preserve and utilise food. Such multidisciplinary thinking across global supply chains is an essential element in the pursuit of achieving sustainable food and nutritional security. The implementation of allied technological and management solutions is reliant on there being sufficient skilled human capital and resources. There is currently a lack of robust postharvest research networks outside of the developed world, and insufficient global funding mechanisms that can support such interdisciplinary collaborations. There is, thus, a collective need for schemes that encourage inter-supply chain research, knowledge exchange and capacity building to reduce food losses and waste. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",2018,"Journal of the science of food and agriculture","10.1002/jsfa.8708",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206168647",21356

However current literature is inconclusive about the effect of prevalidation on functional recovery of patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA) who underwent a THA or TKA. Therefore the aim of this study is to analyse one of the major assumptions underlying the potential effectiveness of prevalidation namely the relationship between preoperative physical activity level and postoperative recovery one year after THA or TKA in a group of 658 OA patients. Methods and Results: From 2006 to 2012, 1061 patients underwent a primary THA or TKA at University Medical Center Groningen. Preoperative and one-year postoperative patients filled in the SQUASH questionnaire to get an impression of their physical activity level, and the WOMAC questionnaire to obtain insight into degree of recovery. Missing data were multiply imputed. No relationship was found between the preoperative total (B-coefficient=0.03, CI95% = -0.033-0.093) and leisure-time physical activity level (B-coefficient=0.042, CI95% = -0.009-0.093) neither for preoperative compliance with the Dutch Recommendation for Health-Enhancing Physical Activity (B-coefficient=0.002, CI95% = -0.053-0.057), and the degree of recovery one year after surgery.

"13541107","Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Male Premutation Carriers of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Gene","Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by premutation expansions (55 – 200 CGG repeats) in the 5’ untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) 1. Males have higher risk of developing FXTAS than females, affecting more than one third of male premutation carriers older than 50 years of age 2. Although intention tremor and ataxia constitute the core clinical features of FXTAS, the main symptoms also include cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction, neuropathy and psychiatric features including anxiety, depression, and apathy 3. ::: ::: The pathogenetic mechanism of FXTAS is not yet fully understood. However, an RNA “toxic” gain-of-function model has been supported by several lines of evidence including the observation of abnormally elevated FMR1 mRNA levels for premutation alleles 4. Previous postmortem histological studies examined the pathological processes in the FXTAS brain and revealed eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes throughout the cerebrum and brainstem with particularly pronounced concentration in the hippocampus 5. Prominent neuropathological features were also found in the cerebellum, including spongiform changes in the deep cerebellar white matter 5,6. ::: ::: There have been only a few in vivo MRI morphometric studies that have examined brain pathology in patients with FXTAS. The T2 hyperintensity signal in the middle cerebellar peduncle and periventricular zones has been reported as a neuroradiological hallmark of FXTAS 7. Our previous MRI study has revealed volume reductions in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem in FXTAS 8,9. Similarly, a previous voxel-based morphometry study on male premutation carriers revealed reduced voxel density in several brain regions, including the cerebellum and amygdalo-hippocampal complex 10. Together with the postmortem findings, the available evidence is suggestive of pronounced pathological changes in, but not limited to, the cerebellar-brainstem and limbic systems in the premutation carriers. ::: ::: In the present study, we use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technology to examine the white matter abnormalities in male premutation carriers with and without FXTAS. DTI is a relatively new MRI tool for studying the white matter microarchitecture 11,12. Fractional anisotropy (FA) provides a useful measure for the degree of restriction of water diffusion in tract fibers. Recent studies indicated that axial diffusivity (magnitude of principal longitudinal diffusivity) and radial diffusivity (mean of diffusivity along the other two orthogonal directions) can be also informative because increases in the two measures may be selectively associated with different aspects of underlying white matter pathology, that is, axonal damage and demyelination 13-15. Here, we employed an automated tract of interest (TOI) analysis for major white matter tracts in the cerebellar-brain and limbic systems by using the White Matter Parcellation Map (WMPM) 16,17. To compare results across multiple methodologies, we also performed Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), a recently developed voxel-based analysis of DTI data in which issues of misregistration can be greatly circumvented 18.

To investigate underground community assembly over evolutionary timescales, we examined terrestrial earthworm communities (Oligochaeta: Haplotaxida) in conserved mountainous primary forests in Japan as a model system. We collected 553 earthworms mostly from two dominant families, the Megascolecidae and the Lumbricidae, from 12 sites. We constructed a molecular taxonomic unit tree based on the analysis of three genes to examine the effects of a biogeographic factor (dispersal ability) and an evolutionary factor (habitat adaptation) on the earthworm community assembly process. The phylogenetic distance of the earthworm communities among sites was positively correlated with geographic distance when intraspecific variation was included, indicating that the divergence within species was affected by biogeographic factors. The community assembly process in the Megascolecidae has also been affected by environmental conditions in relation to an evolutionary relationship between habitat environment and intestinal cecum type, a trait closely related to habitat depth and diet, whereas that in the Lumbricidae has not been affected as such. Intestinal cecum type showed a pattern of niche conservatism in the Megascolecidae lineage.

Vaccinations were performed biweekly from the first until the 6th injection and were then repeated at 6-week intervals after the 7th injection. Treatment continued until disease progression. We herein present two patients with chemotherapy-refractory ovarian CCC who achieved a significant clinical response in an ongoing trial of a GPC3 peptide vaccine. Case 1, a 42-year-old patient with advanced recurrent ovarian CCC with liver and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, received the HLA-A24-restricted GPC3 peptide vaccine. Contrast-enhanced CT at week 10 revealed a partial response (PR) using RECIST criteria. Case 2 was a 67-year-old female with multiple lymph node metastases. She was injected with the HLA-A2-restricted GPC3 peptide vaccine. According to RECIST, PR was achieved at week 37. The stabilization of their diseases over one year provided us with the first clinical evidence to demonstrate that GPC3 peptide-based immunotherapy may significantly prolong the overall survival of patients with refractory ovarian CCC.",2013,"Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics","10.4161/hv.27217",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15499228",21356
"1255734","Cytoskeletal abnormalities in the failing heart: out on a LIM?","The “modern” era in our understanding of heart failure began around 1990, when unexpected results from clinical trials indicated that maladaptive growth, rather than depressed contractility, is the major cause of the poor prognosis in patients with this syndrome,1 and that the long-term benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are due to inhibition of proliferative signaling rather than vasodilation.2 The potential importance of molecular abnormalities in the failing heart was further highlighted in 1990 by the discovery that myosin heavy-chain mutations cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.3 Many additional sarcomeric protein abnormalities are now known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,4 5 and between a quarter and a third of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies appear to be associated with familial disease.6 7 8 In contrast to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, most of the abnormal proteins thus far linked to dilated cardiomyopathy are cytoskeletal, rather than sarcomeric.9 10 ::: ::: The cytoskeleton, like the beams and girders in a modern building, maintains a highly organized structure within cells. Cytoskeletal proteins imbedded in the plasma membrane connect this intracellular matrix with extracellular connective tissue proteins and adjacent cells. In addition to these mechanical functions, the cytoskeleton plays a major role in communication.

"12106111","Patterns of Blunt Use Among Rural Young Adult African-American Men","Background Blunts are hollowed-out cigars or leaf tobacco filled with marijuana. Use of blunts has increased since the 1990s and, in 2005, 3.5% of all American youth were estimated to have used blunts in the past month. Blunt smokers may have greater odds of cannabis and tobacco dependency and are at risk of smoking-related diseases. Previous studies have suggested that blunt use is more common among blacks, older teens, and men. However, data pertaining to blunt use in non-adolescent African-American populations are scarce. Purpose To assess patterns of blunt use among young adult African-American men aged 19–30 years residing in five rural Black Belt counties in Alabama and to compare these data with those from tobacco cigarette smokers within the same study population. Methods Verbal, face-to-face interviewer-administered survey of 415 participants collected and analyzed between December 2008 and February 2011. Results 159 respondents (38.3%) smoked cigarettes and 45 smoked blunts (10.8%). Of blunt smokers, 33 also smoked cigarettes (73.3%). Use of blunts was prevalent among unemployed, single men, and occupational blunt use was uncommon. Factors important in the initiation, maintenance, and cessation of product use were similar for blunt and cigarette smokers, especially product use and acceptance by friends. Legal concerns were an important factor facilitating blunt cessation. Conclusions Blunt use is relatively common among male African Americans aged 19–30 years and is frequently associated with concomitant cigarette use. Tobacco control efforts in this male African-American population should also address blunt usage.",2012,"American journal of preventive medicine","10.1016/j.amepre.2011.08.023",,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12106111",21356
"214793964","Improved face super-resolution generative adversarial networks","The face super-resolution method is used for generating high-resolution images from low-resolution ones for better visualization. The super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) can generate a single super-resolution image with realistic textures, which is a groundbreaking work. Based on SRGAN, we proposed improved face super-resolution generative adversarial networks. The super-resolution image details generated by SRGAN usually have undesirable artifacts. To further improve visual quality, we delve into the key components of the SRGAN network architecture and improve each part to achieve a more powerful SRGAN. First, the SRGAN employs residual blocks as the core of the very deep generator network G. In this paper, we decide to employ dense convolutional network blocks (dense blocks), which connect each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion as our very deep generator networks. Moreover, in the past few years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to solve various problems. Despite its superior performance, it is difficult to train. A simple and effective regularization method called spectral normalization GAN is used to solve this problem. We have experimentally confirmed that our proposed method is superior to the other existing method in training stability and visual improvements.",2020,"Machine Vision and Applications","10.1007/s00138-020-01073-6",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214793964",21356
"18796810","Predicting customer address changes using transaction behavior patterns","Financial services companies are concerned with identifying when customers have moved because of customer service and marketing concerns. Knowing when customers have moved can create opportunities for these companies to better market their financial products and provide improved customer service. This paper focuses on identifying features of customers who have moved for the purpose of predicting customer address changes. The data consisted of transactional and event data from the customer databases of a large financial services company. The analysis involved supervised learning techniques that used information about whether a customer had changed their address in the system as a response variable. The information gained about the features that explain customer address changes was extrapolated to all customers under the assumption that customers that have moved undergo similar spending patterns regardless of whether they changed their address in the database or not. A logistic model found that a combination of various spending factors leads to an 85.6% increase in positive predictive value in predicting customer movement over the general population. The customers labeled by the model as having moved can be marketed to by the financial company to reach a higher percentage of moving customers, including those customers who did not change their address in the database when they moved.",2015,"2015 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","10.1109/SIEDS.2015.7116988",,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18796810",21356
